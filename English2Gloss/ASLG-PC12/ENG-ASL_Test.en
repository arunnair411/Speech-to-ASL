it has been requested that this draft be amended as follows .
monday 
mr president , we have , of course , given this matter a great deal of thought .
this is an important basic principle and an important statement by parliament .
the details of the negotiations taking place in egypt today , in particular , are of crucial importance .
it is you .
we are in parliament , lad .
would mr cohn bendit and mr ferber please stop their argument now .
anything connected with these debates can be addressed in these debates .
el mr president , allow me to inform the house about turkey's offensive behaviour towards greece .
on behalf of every new member state , I wish to register my protest .
you will , of course , receive an answer on this point .
i wish to invoke this hungarian folk greeting to wish you a blessed new year .
this onslaught is not alone disproportionate it is entirely unjustified .
israel must now understand that there are indeed consequences for its actions .
the complexity of this issue can be seen just from the length of time you took for your speech .
the debate will take place on wednesday afternoon .
this also means the loss of probably 2 000 more jobs that depend on dell production in ireland .
thank you mr president .
for eight consecutive years , gas production by gazprom has been stagnating at the same level .
two of our fellow members have already spoken of this .
the negative impact is multiplied exponentially on the fringes of europe and society .
the reason given is that these persons hold the karta polaka .
this is obviously ridiculous and outrageous .
every speaker is saying how serious and dangerous the european union's level of energy dependency is .
the european union imagines itself to be an active force in international relations and a global political player .
this action is immoral , perverted and bizarre , because it essentially constitutes a pre election campaign .
this is a bloody pre election campaign .
i am yet more shocked by the position of the european commission .
with over 900 now dead , the futility of politics by war is painfully evident .
cs thank you , madam president .
i should like to highlight an issue brought to my notice by schoolchildren concerned about the natural environment .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports 
we have not made it easy for ourselves .
we have struggled to find the right solutions in our negotiations with the council and with the commission .
sustainability as the overall concept for european agriculture will guarantee healthy food and a healthy environment .
the basic principleas much as necessary , as little as possibleassumes comprehensive , sound knowledge .
plant protection products are , in fact , medicine for plants .
compliance with the stipulations of the water framework directive is top priority .
risk reduction means that professional users must obtain sound and ongoing training in the use of plant protection products .
however , a ban must be based on scientifically sound findings and not on political dogmas .
first of all , sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent collaboration .
therefore , safety can only be achieved with an outright ban .
we will ensure successful environmental protection with the cut off for persistent , bioaccumulative toxic pbt substances .
they would dilute this compromise .
this is a compromise to which the council has already given its approval .
parliament helped to make the directive more ambitious than the council's common position on certain important points .
the agreement reached represents significant progress in the protection of public health and the environment in the european union .
plant protection products play an important role in agriculture , horticulture , forestry and gardening .
we therefore need to ensure they are regulated in an effective and balanced way .
duplicative testing on animals would be completely avoided .
the commission has just made a declaration on this point .
these are substances that impair the development of children's brains .
i should like to reassure certain stakeholders who have cast doubt on the availability of active substances and products .
this compromise takes account of their fears .
the three zone system guarantees member states the possibility of authorising a larger number of products .
of course I am concerned about any overuse of pesticides and about their effects .
there is no doubt that rates of cancer have increased .
this makes our potatoes and winter cereal crops susceptible to weeds and disease such as blight .
in theory this may work .
you should read the agreement !
what the pesticide industry wants is that we do not set any criteria .
and now to mrs klass , many thanks for your work !
and , of course , we would have liked more rights for the residents of areas adjacent to agriculture .
parliament rightly insisted on legislation that would be effective and suitable for the task .
we should , in fact , be concerned with general interests .
this chiefly concerns high risk substances .
we are taking a real step forward and I hope that the parliamentary vote will not come to blows !
there will be job losses , some units will become non viable and production will stop .
integrated pest programmes have already decreased the need for pesticides .
as ever , a compromise is about give and take .
it will be impossible for poor countries to deal with this matter without union aid .
i should like to thank mrs klass and mrs breyer very much for the reports they have prepared .
the sustainable production and consumption of food is , after all , a basic human right .
this package lacks the sufficient scientific rigour which is needed both to defend our health and our economy .
it is my fear that the package will have the opposite effect of the progressive intentions behind it .
this report proposes strict and tighter controls .
collectively , it must be possible for us to be protected against toxicity .
it is important for it to be stated that a product comes from the eu member states .
let me tell you now .
this is why it is important to narrow the chasm between regular and organic farming in a responsible manner .
first of all , some of the most dangerous chemical pesticides are being banned .
exceptions are allowed where no alternatives are yet available .
that , too , is important .
significant financial support is a priority , rather than additional legal provisions .
this will be a credit to parliament .
my farmers struggle continually with fungal infestation .
we are told pesticides might disrupt dna .
gm is based on disrupting dna .
in the face of the irresponsible pressure exerted by ecologists , it is comforting that common sense has prevailed .
our debates about chemicals are too often conducted on a very irrational level .
it is welcome that we have retained the three zone ruling even with considerable exemptions for member states .
a courageous step to a consistent internal market solution would look different at this stage 
i believe that the compromises we hope to agree on are sound .
they should ensure that the restrictions introduced will promote health without threatening the development of european agriculture .
our farmers will have to pay more for safer pesticides .
but in this instance the commission still has a great task ahead of it .
these principles were taken into consideration in a balanced manner , overall .
member states will have sufficient room to manoeuvre to implement this accordingly .
the directive lays down a training and certification system for distributors and professional users of pesticides .
in my low lying country , the situation is very specific .
for this reason , this directive poses extremely serious dangers .
yes , that may be the case , but the question is how justified are these worries ?
what happens if there are no alternatives ?
if the commission would work with eu food producers on this , we could make progress .
es madam president , I would like to make reference to the breyer report .
what is so vital or of so much concern that the commission are opposed to an impact assessment ?
let us leave it and just assume that people will not bother about it ?
we have done a huge amount of surveys on this .
i leave you with one or two last thoughts on this .
we have needed fungicides to reduce blight and actually grow the potatoes .
we have had two of the wettest summers on record it is time for you to look again .
my pleasure !
alcohol , pure alcohol , is a hazard .
the eu impact assessment has been referred to .
i would invite the agrochemical industry and their cerp community to look into and invest in this area .
it is not simply a matter of measuring levels of residues in food .
we must not permit such unequal terms of competition for european farmers .
this will have the effect of sending retail prices soaring , affecting worst those least able to pay .
but what have we done along the way ?
i think they will at least help give the industry some support in the future .
there is no point in europe legislating itself out of business because we cannot control what is imported in .
the principle of prevention must be applied .
only certain categories of small distributors will be exempt from this requirement .
let me reply , however , to some of the comments that have been made here .
this mrl is valid for eu production , but also for imported food and feed .
this is the position regarding imported goods .
we now look forward to the formalisation of the second reading agreement .
what was achieved is important .
we still need an evaluation .
we have managed to find a good compromise from different starting positions .
with the ban on these highly toxic substances , they will become illegal in europe .
therefore , there is no reason whatsoever to encourage further dissent , panic and fear !
the president cut off the speaker 
i heard what the commissioner said on the food import situation .
their cousins outside the european union can use these products .
sorry for the anger .
full stop .
i would encourage you to continue it in the corridors , if necessary .
written statements rule 142 
on this occasion , we also have the member states on our side , represented by the council .
the plan was due to be submitted to the council and parliament last autumn .
can you reassure me , commissioner , that the action plan is ready ?
between cities , in standards of protection for the urban environment ?
in road safety standards in cities ? in standards of citizensaccess to mobility ?
we need coordination and innovative projects , and to develop and share reliable and comparable statistics .
as a matter of fact , although cities are all different , they face common challenges .
the highlight has been the extremely successful civitas programme that started in 2000 .
we can help local authorities to implement related eu policies and to make best use of eu funding .
you have tried to sidestep the issue and you have done a balancing act .
possibility number one is there a shortage of technical information within the directorate general for transport ?
possibility number two you say that the conditions are not favourable .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the constant delay and your answer , commissioner , are not acceptable .
secondly , we only want to grant eu money if cities can present a sustainable mobility plan .
the cohesion fund may also support this work .
we agreed that these actions should be supportive , in other words , that they should involve assistance .
i am very disappointed with your response .
in all our cities , we face problems of mobility .
67 % of european citizens expect a european policy to be developed in this area .
last year we approved the report on promoting the use of green vehicles in public transport .
therefore , I have no doubt that what you have said will be seriously taken into account by him .
written statements rule 142 
even the directorate general for competition attended in great numbers .
i am vehemently opposed to the commission's plans .
member states organise and finance the public broadcasters as they see fit .
is that what we want ?
moreover , this test is very detailed the proposal is lacking in flexibility .
there are also differences in terms of language and culture .
the commission admitted that the proposals were probably excessively detailed and that the wording needed editing .
this was an excellent result .
you will understand , madam president , that I am pleasantly surprised with these pledges .
secondly , how can technological impartiality be guaranteed ?
this dialogue between the commission and parliament is important .
this concurs with our views both public and private broadcasting are important .
the objective of modernising the communication is to increase transparency and legal certainty .
why do we have these tests ?
because having these tests at the national level helps to avoid commission intervention .
we cannot agree that the amsterdam test would involve an unjustifiable administrative burden .
secondly , the draft exempts pilot projects from the test .
the solutions found in these countries are proportionate to the resources available .
well , to some extent , this is true , but not entirely .
we are 100 % behind balanced competitive relations between the public and private broadcasters .
there should be room for both to be able to provide quality content .
we get the impression with the proposals you are making now that you are actually encouraging over regulation .
we require this as part of the lisbon strategy .
there are already controlling bodies for public broadcasting the broadcasting councils .
we monitor the adaptation to technological change .
we monitor the measures in order to ensure fair competition .
our independence is guaranteed by law .
the commission agrees with these goals .
the draft communication makes clear that pilot projects are exempt from the tests .
the commission also wants to guarantee a mixture of public and private .
it protects the ability to keep up with changes in our fast moving media environment .
the union should endeavour to adopt an external energy policy .
as a result , I feel much empathy and involvement with that region .
the principle of statesterritorial integrity is sacred and must be respected in the future .
thirty thousand children die of hunger and poverty related illnesses a day .
i suppose , driving all of this , we need to look at the issue of research and development .
how do we do that ?
by providing stable prices and also looking at the costs of food production .
unless farmers get that income stimulus , they will pull back .
there is a lot in this report .
energy prices constitute only one of these factors but one which has both a direct and indirect impact .
the topic of biofuels was discussed in detail during the various ep sessions .
a sustainable eu biofuels policy is overall a pro poor policy .
enhanced trade flows are part of the solution towards food security .
the vote will take place on tuesday at 12 noon .
european and international systems for monitoring production and the market as an early warning system for identifying production trends 
such development will have to be sustainable and will have to rely first and foremost on local agriculture .
now more than ever agriculture is playing a central role in the areas of growth and development .
the separation of direct agricultural funding from production is likewise heading in this direction .
developing civil dialogue under the treaty of lisbon short presentation 
decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizen . 
the latter is a dialogue that is not defined in law .
i would like civil dialogue to be a reciprocal , two sided process .
this means it should not just involve the european union approaching citizens , and the latter responding .
i would like civil dialogue to be based on the principles of clarity and transparency .
i should like to add too that the member states should also be required to promote civil dialogue .
i have been unable to mention every part of this report .
it is one of the key tools for communication between european institutions , eu society and eu citizens .
the debate is closed .
civil society represents many non governmental and not for profit organisations established by the citizens of their own free will .
membership in a civil society organisation provides european citizens with the opportunity to take active part in policy making .
the mechanism of consultation forms an integral part of the activities of european institutions .
this must be prevented in future by a pro active information and dialogue policy .
this all brings to mind the definition of democracy .
in particular , many member states have made considerable efforts to meet their obligations with regard to the pact .
the debate is closed .
we have worked very well together on the production of the report .
nevertheless , some member states have not undertaken transposal .
it is possible , then .
this applies not only to consumers but also to small enterprises and tradespeople .
we know of many examples , such as annoying advertising and misleading and aggressive business practices .
we all know the address book fraud that is a widespread problem throughout europe .
we know about cheating on the lottery and much more besides .
these two acts would be a good start .
for those cases the commission will not hesitate to launch infringement proceedings .
misleading business to business practices are already covered by the directive concerning misleading and comparative advertising .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on tuesday at 12 noon .
only a well informed consumer is able to detect misleading advertising and avoid the disappointment it may cause .
cfp and the ecosystem approach to fisheries management short presentation 
healthy marine ecosystems can only be safeguarded through a policy which involves all sectors which impact on these ecosystems .
this is also the overall thrust of the report and we appreciate the agreement on this point .
the report touches on many questions regarding the specific instruments to be utilised in the future .
it is indicated that fishermen affected by management plans and measures to protect ecosystems should be subsidised or compensated .
in the mean time , I thank parliament for its support for our approach as expressed through this report .
written statement rule 142 
i would like to extend my thanks to all of these women .

the fund industry has not escaped unscathed from the financial crisis .
we have come a long way since july 200this is true at all stages initial authorisation , ongoing supervision and enforcement .
you have shown that europe can move speedily to bring about useful regulatory improvements .
you must build on this achievement now and complete the ambitious programme of implementing legislation .
the internal guarantees provided by ucits explain why they are recognised by investors well beyond europe's borders .
the changes made in 2001 opened new investment areas for ucits but they left behind several bottlenecks .
today , we can welcome the major advances in efficiency offered by the proposal that we have before us .
it is a complete passport and we welcome it .
the supervision measures it includes will certainly be effective in removing any doubts which might have been expressed .
on the principle , there is no more to say the passport is its own defence .
i do not exclude the possibility of success , but it is not guaranteed either .
i know this only too well , as I was responsible for steering through ucits in 200this has largely happened .
many obstacles were removed in 200i would like to remind everyone that it was not particularly easy then , either .
there will be greater protection for investors .
we are aware of the different opinions .
competition and openness are always good in a well organised market .
a balance must be achieved between relevant information and effectiveness .
a reasonable balance is also required in this area .
ucits have cleared the way and become a success and an esteemed trade mark outside europe , too .
most importantly , we have to achieve greater economies of scale in europe .
i am very glad to support mr klinz's report and the ucits revision .
we thus need the supervision issues in this area to be defined .
it is a result of a remarkably quick consensus .
today's debate has shown that we have broad cross party support for the compromise we have negotiated here .
thank you very much .
the first of january 2009 was the 10th birthday of our currency , the euro .
the euro area has become a rock of macroeconomic stability .
applause 
many more thought that it would never happen or that it was doomed to failure .
this price stability is an advantage for all european citizens .
the single currency is a factor for dynamism in the european economy .
de the last few months have demonstrated another advantage of the euro .
the european parliament played a crucial role at the pioneering stage .
parliament was the first institution in europe to make proposals for a single currency , back in 196these challenges were successfully overcome and the euro is firmly established today .
thirdly , enlargement .
we are now 16 countries .
as a tangible sign recognised around the world , the euro is a measure of stability .
after 10 years , it has to be recognised that the euro is an unquestionable success .
exceptional situations demand exceptional measures .
we must safeguard the foundations of this success .
this move had the backing and support of our partners in the benelux countries and italy .
let us counter the inevitability of failure with the energy of success .
there were 11 of us to start with , and now there are we are expecting others to join us .
however , an anniversary is also a time for looking to the future .
on the subject of economic cooperation , jean claude juncker described the crisis that we are going through .
let us learn then the lessons from this .
governments must learn to talk together about their economic policies .
i agree that we must not demand the exorbitant privilege of being the reserve currency .
finally , I believe that the euro is much more than just a currency .
we are working today , too , under the chairmanship of mrs berès , for the same representation .
the euro has been well received by the public .
it has gained the world's trust .
that is something we can all be proud of .
in 10 years , the euro has become a strong symbol for europe .
for those who do not , the euro was associated with price rises .
they are the guarantee of effectiveness , competiveness and growth .
in any case , the attraction of the euro remains intact .
the euro will have a key role to play in this new stability .
the ecb is only in charge of monetary policy .
european monetary union is a reality the euro has been in existence for 10 years today .
it can therefore be said that the european central bank has performed very well .
the euro's international role needs to be further strengthened .
this is no mere bagatelle .
were it not for the euro , we would have repeated the experience of 1992 , only worse .
the maastricht treaty was approved , but no political europe was created .
this target may seem a bit absurd .
all I would say is that we need to apply properly the good aspects of the maastricht treaty .
but the greek government is stuck inside the euro straitjacket .
there is nothing it can do .
it will take leadership , or possibly the inevitable economic meltdown .
you can ignore the markets if you want to , but in time the markets will not ignore you .
all have failed , all have damaged the participants , and so it is with the euro .
italy's competitiveness is shot to pieces .
happy birthday to the euro !
emu protects the profits of the monopolies and facilitates privatisation and merger .
the euro was 10 years old on 1 january 200at the same time , slovakia became the 16th country to use the euro .
according to current estimates , it will be around 0.6 % .
an additional stimulus is needed .
we have to keep to the basic principles and criteria of economic and monetary union .
on 1 january 2009 the euro became the official currency of slovakia .

trade and economic relations with western balkans 
developing civil dialogue under the treaty of lisbon 
de madam president , I have the following request .
obviously , I supported my own report .
it is not serving the people of europe well it is not serving the farmers of britain well .
until that burden is taken away from the european taxpayers , then we are going to be in difficulties .
it is a shame that nobody else seems to read some of these reports that go through this place .
it is reciprocal .
that means putting the treaty to a referendum .
if only we had two way dialogue .
look at those countries where fishermen are given rights that are tradable and passed on from generation to generation .
we will return to the explanations of vote after the formal sitting .
formal sitting latvia
we must and should rejoice in that .
mr president , it gives me great pleasure to invite you now to address the european parliament .
may I warmly welcome you once again to the european parliament .
applause 
dear friends , this year , 2009 , is a very significant year for latvia .
membership of these international organisations became a strategic aim for latvia following the restoration of independence in 199latvia clearly expressed its wish to participate in european and transatlantic economic and security structures .
on 18 november last year , latvia celebrated the 90th anniversary of its proclamation .
it once again affirmed our steadfast will to live in an independent , free and democratic nation .
peace reigned among the nations of the eastern bloc , but it was the peace of the prison courtyard .
today , I should like to look at much more recent history .
this year marks five years since latvia became a member of the european union and of nato .
what sort of time has this been for latvia ?
what has our nation gained ?
secondly , membership of the european union has improved the investment climate in latvia .
we can be proud that we have at our disposal such a unique mechanism of collaboration .
the european union offers great opportunities , but each nation and each society must grasp them by itself .
no !
we were persuaded that the laws of the market would by themselves be sufficiently efficient in promoting economic development .
that is indeed what happens .
in this situation , a complex approach at national , european and global level is what is needed .
that will only be possible by designing a new architecture and mechanisms for the financial system .
we welcome the commission's european economic recovery plan .
it is an important step out of the morass in which we find ourselves at this time .
this agreement provides for special attention to be paid to monitoring how the loan granted to latvia is utilised .
the european union has the foreign policy instruments to resolve this issue .
the energy market , however , is stagnating .
here , the european commission has done noteworthy work .
the global economy is much more closely linked than it was half a century ago .
at the same time , powerful new economic players have appeared on the world scene .
only together can we fulfil the promises of security and wellbeing for our citizens .
that is our common responsibility towards europe .
ladies and gentlemen , until 2004 , latvia's goal was membership of the european union .
there will no longer be old and new , small and large european nations .
what will be latvia's role in the european union of 2015 ?
our vision of an open europe and our experience of integration will be the spur to europe's openness .
ladies and gentlemen , 2015 is not far away only six years stand between us .
those are still wise words today .
i am convinced that europe will change materially .
it is how our work will be judged .
it is our responsibility .
applause 
on the basis of our common values , we are strong , democratic and free .
thank you , president zatlers , it was a joy to welcome you here today .
applause 
i think this piece of legislation will make it appropriate that we have higher standards across the european union .
a wide range of common products can be hazardous if the handling and usage instructions are ignored .
cs madam president , I would like to respond again to yesterday's plenary debate .
i would like to mention that we must apply these requirements strictly to imported goods as well .
madam president , I have a confession to make .
madam president , I too found this a particularly difficult decision .
i think we need impact assessments conducted on a scientific basis .
madam president , the efficient and effective use of pesticides is a necessity .
i agree with mrs wallis about the legislative process and that there should have been a third reading .
madam president , I tried to undermine the compromise by voting against those parts of this report .
just like the issue of safety one can never be too secure .
i agree in principle with paolo costa's report on civil aviation .
however , it is vital in this overseas partnership that we are real partners , not just on paper .
the future of the external transport policy requires good relations between the european community and the united states .
i voted in favour of this report for better legal regulation of companies within the eu .
furthermore , it is good that the report underlines the need to establish a common energy policy .
serbia , for example , is not even mentioned .
that is why constructive and positive signals from the european parliament are also important .
the eu has a key role to play in the recovery of that region .
the report is not in line with these views and we are therefore voting against it .
this means providing food for 70 million more people every year .
in writing . sv it is important that we combat and alleviate starvation .
i have , nevertheless , chosen to abstain , because the report was strongly protectionist in places .
however , there are also aspects with which we cannot agree 
in writing . the mcguinness report deals with issues of immense global importance .
otherwise the negotiations , which have already broken down , will continue to have little likelihood of success .
i voted against this report .
outside the legislative procedure , the report we have before us is not particularly impressive .
this entails an unnecessary increase in bureaucracy that leads nowhere .
how would this mindset be defined ?
this is binding on all eu policies and spheres of activity .
the success of dialogue depends on representativeness , and therefore on the strong commitment of key entities .
the european authorities must be open to dialogue and cooperation with the citizens and with organisations from civil society .
anyone may contribute to the common good .
there are alternative policies for the fishing industry in portugal .
in writing . I voted in favour of mr guerreiro's report .
a linear reduction in the number of products would be insane .
the problem with france must be solved with understanding .
controls must also be much more restrictive in order to fully protect public health .
i still regret the fact that we dropped the 50 % objective .
a european minimum distance would have been preferable from an environmental and public health point of view .
undoubtedly , businesses will shed jobs and even cease trading altogether .
no one disputes the importance of protecting the environment but this legislation is unbalanced .
it is overly prescriptive and lacks flexibility .
the commission has failed to carry out a sufficiently comprehensive and up to date impact assessment study .
this document will help to harmonise the legislation on pesticides .
in recent years the union has constantly increased the limit values and a reduction was therefore long overdue .
the chinese toy episode should be a lesson to us .
derogation options were expressly created for 12 substances .
i would prefer the common position as it would give a better balance between public health and food production .
we cannot legislate in the abstract !
whilst allowing low risk products onto the market , it bans 22 substances deemed to be very harmful .
european agriculture , which makes abundant use of plant protection products , will not be weakened .
it is vital that sufficient fund managers are available to maintain a proper watch on mc passports .
the directive sets basic requirements on the organisation , management and oversight of investment funds .
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
it is true that the national legislature could create derogations from this obligation .
as the european data protection supervisor said , it is a further benefit in the fight against child trafficking .
the respective initiatives should be introduced by the commission within the framework of the respective area of civil law .
the use of this type of data would only be acceptable if it truly offered protection to our children .
that is not yet the case .
we remain , however , open to any positive changes in the technology in this field .
this revolutionary principle has nothing to do with biometric data .
we believe that it has crucial implications for personal data safety and for fundamental rights .
we cannot agree that everyone holding the european passport is a usual suspect whose fingerprints are to be stored .
it is therefore right to create an exemption here for children .
this report does not speak about the reliability of biometric data itself .
however , I would like to explore this issue in a little more detail .
of course , every parent would happily hand over that amount if it contributed to their child's safety .
this is because normally the security of these documents is lower than the level applied when issuing biometric passports .
these factors are in turn a guarantee of a more effective fight against crime , terrorism and illegal immigration .
i wish to comment on just one point in the report .
experience shows that the number of children among the victims of human trafficking is steadily increasing .
in short , we should be reasonably flexible in this regard .
however , what arrangements would pertain when children travel by train , coach or other means of public transport ?
how would that be monitored ?
i think that we ought to include an instruction that benefits the child , or rather , the passenger .
a current study shows that it is unaccompanied minors who are the victims of such crimes .
i think the report is not only important , but also good .
i also call for the role of the european data protection supervisor to nevertheless be taken into account .
mr president , I also wish to thank mr coelho .
sk protecting children from abduction and trafficking requires the introduction of children's passports .
the new method of identification will simplify border controls .
this stays the same from conception to death and even beyond .
this is therefore an objective which can be used to achieve security for children .
for me it goes without saying that data protection laws must be respected .
we should not even be discussing that .
i will give the parliament several answers to several questions .
first , I have to say that , in its proposals , the commission has always stressed data protection .
thank you very much to all of you for your collaboration .
the debate is closed .
it is commendable that this requirement will now be enforced in all member states .
setting an age limit reduces the risk of an error being made when identifying people by taking their fingerprints .
in the short time we have available , I want to raise three important points .
the first is about the council .
let me also comment on the issue of exchange of information between the institutions .
some of your other assertions , mr cappato , are incorrect .
for example , you state that 90 % of legislative activity is done through comitology .
it can already be seen , mr cappato .
the allowances that meps claim are also public .
in other words , it is perfectly possible for citizens to gain access to this information .
we need to define what thelegislative capacityis .
my heart is with you , but I have to follow my head .
thank you very much for the extra time , mr president .
good luck , marco .
however , these debates do not include political group debates .
i support the rapporteur's proposal for improvements in connection with the annual report .
these authorities appoint officials to implement democratic decisions .
the fact that this happens nevertheless has two explanations .
the second explanation , however , is sound and involves a difficult balancing act .
there is a lot of internal resistance to quash .
i will vote for nearly everything contained in his proposal .
this is especially important now , as we approach the june elections to the european parliament .
citizens must be able to acquire a full understanding of our activities .
this is our route now and in the future .
otherwise we will end up knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing .
by this I mean that our workload is really quite broad .
otherwise some very valuable work that is not concentrated in parliament could be lost because it would be invisible .
i agree with michael cashman that all citizens should know how their ministers vote in council .
this is crucial .
this was also my experience .
however , although many people have internet access these days , not everyone does .
in the end , they will spend half the day writing a report about what they have done .
vice president of the commission . mr president , thank you for this debate and this discussion .
it is , of course , absolutely fundamental that they have access to information .
i think we are still struggling with that in some cases .
this is certainly a part of strengthening democracy in europe .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , I offer my very warm thanks to the commissioner .
the vote will take place on wednesday 14 january 2009 , at 12 noon .
written statements rule 142 
however , there is a general misconception on our revenues .
in future the council must ensure that all its debates , documents and information are open to public scrutiny .
it is not about greater arms expenditure , but about spending the existing money more wisely .
that is what we need to do .
we owe it to our taxpayers .
incidentally , we should be having this debate in brussels and not in strasbourg .
thank you .
the commission welcomes the text that we have now on the table .
it will give contracting authorities the flexibility they need to negotiate contracts which are often particularly complex and sensitive .
many elements from the 2004 procurement directive have been retained here .
we are in agreement with our national colleagues on this issue .
these are good enough reasons alone for the social democrats to accept the result .
we have succeeded in that .
i know he dedicated himself to this very important work .
mr president , commissioner , mr lambsdorff has done an excellent job .
this is especially true in the case of procurement for the army or defence forces .
i think that we will have to return to this subject .
i believe that the position presented in the proposal for a directive is correct .
last but not least , legal remedy can now be utilised for the first time .
this morning we celebrated 10 years of the euro .
this involves a large credit of trust that the member states have now become willing to give .
we need to go further along this road .
in fact , this translates a desire for integration of state sovereignties .
the same thing will be noted in the field of justice .
it certainly has nothing to do with strengthening defence capabilities .
this step is vital , in order to meet global challenges in the field of defence .
we should not forget an important element , namely the introduction of a control procedure .
it is also important that there are fundamental provisions governing the security of supply and information .
this is in the interests of bringing our industry together across europe .
at the same time , however , parliament has many reasons to be satisfied .
hence , it is to a large extent parliament's proposal .
we are convinced that this directive will make a difference and contribute to a real european defence market .
she said that these products are expensive through lack of competition .
no one can deny that this is the case .
defence ministers should be responsible for establishing implementation priorities .
we are going to deal with a series of questions addressed to the commission .
subject ten years of the euro
surveillance must build on the existing instruments .
the recovery plan recognises the inherent division of tasks embedded into the eu economic policy framework .
commissioner , I very much appreciate your reply .
how do you envisage new ways of trying to generate stimulus in economies of the eu countries ?
de commissioner , I am interested in the following point .
it could perhaps be one of the two member states with an opt out .
subject collapse in dairy prices on the eu market
i would also like to remind you of the situation back in 200this shows clearly that dairy producers are reacting to market signals .
with respect , your staff indicated that my request had been noted .
the commission is in favour of developing microcredit and microfinance institutions more generally .
my question to the commission is has an overall evaluation of this instrument been carried out ?
developing countries generally have extremely fragile policies on these things .
i am very happy to have at least two questions because we were asking for more interest from parliament .
the responsibilities of the member states are another important element .
a clearer allocation of responsibilities between member states and the commission is needed .
the third element is the rigidity of our budget .
we hope for the support of the parliament in these political discussions and later in negotiations with the council .
it is a very sensible question on cap in general .
that is how we probably will see the medium term future .
we tried to be as objective as possible .
so it is public it is available .
it is not yet our opinion .
negotiations on budget finalisation usually centre on juste retour negotiations .
they will be part of the political response that will follow later this year .
sv I have a short question to ask the commissioner .
i took part in the commission's excellent conference in december on the mid term review of the budget .
this is probably even more important than how much money we actually have or can inject .
the commission is now looking at how to update and implement these instruments .
i will conclude by saying that we must keep in mind that the internet is a global information network .
the european union cannot regulate it on its own .
i would like to ask you a supplementary question , commissioner .
madam president , I will answer mr aylward .
we have tried to promote and facilitate effective information sharing between the police forces of the various member states .
in particular , judge jean louis bruguière has been given the task of monitoring the swift terrorist finance tracking programme .
his findings will be available soon .
i have not heard anything about an opt out clause in this field .
pt mr barrot , I agree with you I agree with your dissatisfaction .
the truth is that illegal immigration to europe continues .
the trafficking of human beings continues .
the commission must carry on without losing its enthusiasm for this policy of cooperation and aid for member states .
has the commission encouraged member states to adopt a common position on this ?
the question about pharmacists was raised by mr angelakas .
there has been court jurisprudence on this particular matter .
there are various stages of proceedings against member states in this area .
the financial crisis shed a new light on cras .
since august 2007 the financial markets worldwide suffered from a major confidence crisis .
the credit rating agencies are close to the origin of the problems that have arisen with subprime markets .
the massive financial crisis occurred and now here you are telling us that we need a stricter legislative framework .
we do indeed need a stricter regulatory framework .
and that is what has occurred .
subject financial crisis
we need to demonstrate that europe can provide concrete answers .
this flexibility certainly does not mean any changes to the single market principles .
but there is a balance to be struck between being overly pessimistic and being realistic .
the next item is the commission statement on the pharmaceutical products package .
this also applies to protection against counterfeit medicines .
the rapidly growing numbers of fake medicines have forced us to act .
community wide access to information about undesirable or previously unknown side effects will make community wide risk management significantly easier .
finally , the pharmaceutical package includes a proposal for improved patient information .
patients are already actively searching for information .
in my opinion this situation is both dreadful and intolerable .
i hope that I will have the support of the european parliament for this package .
thank you very much .
but we are looking now at the three items that you have referred to .
counterfeiting is one of the curses of our age .
commissioner verheugen has rightly raised the fact that a number of amendments to the legislation are necessary .
supervision of a medicine is limited once it reaches the market .
anyone watching prime time television in the united states can see what trouble this can cause .
the legislative proposal relaxes the rules on the circulation of information via the internet and printed media .
i think that it is good to address environmental aspects , for example .
contamination from pharmaceutical products is a growing problem in treatment works .
i would therefore like us to tighten up the legislation in this area .
as regards the counterfeiting of medicines , this is probably also connected to our current patent system .
there is an extremely large difference in price .
manufacture would then be licence free .
finally , I would just like to say something about nanotechnology .
i would like better methods to be introduced for investigating the toxicology of nanoparticles .
this is perhaps not particularly strange , as pharmaceutical products affect everyone .
i do not want to see advertisements for prescription pharmaceutical products .
it is this part of the commission's proposal that I am quite dubious about .
the names are often different despite the fact that the medicines contain identical substances .
could there not be a way to simplify things for those who live in cross border regions ?
i have been critical of serious shortcomings in the veterinary medicines directive now for some time .
finally , I also have concerns with the role of drug companies in influencing doctorsprescription habits .
work on the database is going well and it will be available in the foreseeable future .
we will not permit this under any circumstances .
it must be authorised before it is published and it is subject to strict quality controls .
i must state clearly at this point that vaccines are , of course , not freely available .
however , this information was not available to them .
these statistics show that patient information can even save money .
i am thinking , for example , of the very well known publication apothekenumschau in my native country .
european approval is the exception , not the rule .
i think the structures are very different in these cases .
the debate is closed .
dangerous substances and preparations dichloromethane debate 
it is easy to be affected by it .
a proper protective set up consists of very high spec gloves that have to be changed every three hours .
that is why self contained breathing equipment is needed .
this was , in fact , the last chance before reach to ban chemicals in the old fashioned way .
we are now creating a market for the alternatives .
the marketing and use of dichloromethane by professionals will be subject to a general ban .
measures to minimise evaporation from containers of paint stripper must also be put in place .
mr schlyter recommends that you support the compromise text negotiated with the council .
i am therefore in a position to give my full support to the compromise on behalf of the commission .
this is a valid compromise and it is important to recognise that dichloromethane is responsible for many accidents .
i regret , moreover , that we have very little information on the accidents at work that have happened .
under normal temperatures their use causes them to evaporate to dangerous levels .
there is no effective way to ensure the safe use of dichloromethanes for the public .
these products can be used safely industrially in the right conditions .
i mentioned that I have a constituency interest in this .
i have been in correspondence with commissioner verheugen for seven years now on this issue .
some member states , such as sweden , denmark and austria , have already introduced a ban on dcm .
for this , I can but give high praise to our rapporteur , mr schlyter .
in the end , this is quite acceptable .
prove that environmental considerations take priority over the demands of the market in more cases than this single example .
economic factors should not be used as a reason for maintaining this poison in common use .
it has been a hard road to get to this .
he has talked about industrial lobbies .
he has also referred to an industrial lobby in his constituency , which successfully persuaded him of the alternative .
i think that this , among many other substances , poses a high risk .
it is potentially hazardous .
if it is misused there is a direct risk of death and this factor has implications for terrorism .
we are aware of very few accidents involving the alternative substances .
of course , the staff who have helped me to reach this agreement have also played an important role .
there has been no lack of clarity between the commission and me in relation to this issue .
i would just like to illustrate this chemical to you all .
i will take this opportunity to appeal to the commission to ensure that the regulations are complied with .
it damages the nervous system and causes serious damage to internal organs , which can directly lead to death .
withdrawing dcm from general circulation therefore seems to be the most sensible and responsible solution .
all european institutions support the generally recognised programme for decent work .
an important part of the commission's approach is its support for international work standards .
the areas of shared competence also cover several other themes .
this challenge will be supported by a review of the ratification situation performed by the council before january 20the difficulties in reconciling those positions are extremely complex .
fishermen out of work in ireland are denied social welfare payments and this creates great hardship .
i hope so .
the debate closed .
documents received see minutes
the next item is a statement by the council on the presentation of the czech presidency's programme .
i see only one way of fulfilling this task honourably .
the role of the country holding the presidency is neither to promote its interests nor to make decisions .
i shall always rigorously , decisively and correctly uphold that here .
i fundamentally disagree with this type of criticism .
finally , the issue of energy security once again demands our urgent attention .
in addition to our scheduled tasks we shall , like the french presidency , have to face new events .
further surprises can never be ruled out .
this vision gains new importance in today's troubled political and economic situation .
for anyone in need of exercise , 2 gs is plenty of exertion .
we have also led a european delegation to the area of the middle east conflict .
in the area of foreign trade , the presidency is focusing on a revival of discussions at the wto .
here , we attach great importance to successful completion of the doha development agenda dda .
i fully endorse this view .
naturally , we are also interested in diversifying the supply and transport routes .
we need to think seriously about developing safe nuclear energy .
while this priority is called energy , it is inseparably linked with climate protection policy .
such a consensus should also reflect current trends in the world economy .
last but not least , the priority of europe in the world includes the area of internal security .
i began by saying that the czech question is also a european question .
thank you for your attention .
with this package , we are able to take steps towards reaching an ambitious international agreement in december .
i shall come back to this .
you are still in the process of examining some very important proposals , ladies and gentlemen .
it is here where europe's citizens will feel most pressure this year .
the fact is that gazprom and naftogas are unable to fulfil their obligations towards european consumers .
i would like to convey a very clear message to moscow and kiev .
things are likely to get worse before becoming better .
rules to ensure that the benefits of european integration are shared out amongst citizens .
applause 
are we ready to release the budgetary resources needed to give us the means to conduct our policy ?
mr topolánek , you have rightly made the union's external relations one of your priorities .
he put that right , which is a good thing .
karel schwarzenberg says israel is acting in self defence , whilst louis michel says the country is violating international law .
prague castle was also the seat of charles iv , as the prime minister mentioned .
therefore , this period in prague castle was truly european .
applause 
your recipe will be contested , but not by liberals and democrats .
currently , our monitors are blocked from ukrainian dispatch centres .
applause 
we support them .
i hope that the czech republic presidency will address this in the coming months .
america will have a new president next week and we all have major challenges ahead of us .
certainly we must regulate the financial markets soon .
i know you have the capacity to meet those challenges .
to sum up , this is a programme that reveals a world with many dangers and few opportunities .
yet the czech presidency is pursuing restrained objectives and sensible priorities , and will be very successful .
you see , we have experience in one other area too .
it is simply evil , and you can change it .
that is , freedom , prosperity , competitiveness and security , not euro health , euro taxes , euro parks and euro beer .
that happens to be my personal view of it .
this 60 year conflict has solved nothing .
independence requires that we have a good mix of various energy sources .
this is a requirement of security for our continent .
fr madam president , europe's credibility is at stake with regard to the energy issue .
to do that , we have to act together .
it is scandalous to see such a small proportion of the structural funds being invested in something useful !
there is also the turkish issue .
you have spoken of mobilising those countries which share your liberal economic outlook to oppose protectionism at this time .
good luck .
your activity will become even more difficult with the rising political tensions related to the european election campaign .
the end of your presidency will be marked by the election of 532 new meps .
i underline this figure because it is not the one foreseen in the treaty of lisbon .
do more to put the european economy back on track while preserving people's jobs .
this will not be possible if there is no unity within your own country .
the second prerequisite is to unite behind you the main political parties in this parliament .
this is something to be learned from the french presidency .
finally , I would like to draw attention to the rise of extremism , anti semitism and xenophobia in europe .
i wish you every success .
however , I will draw attention to some issues that I hope your presidency can address .
firstly , the motto you have chosen iseurope without barriers.
i hope that you will honour your commitment to reach a first reading agreement with my roaming ii report .
thank you , and I wish you the best of luck during your presidency .
applause 
applause 
as an irish member , I should like to thank the czech government and people .
you have spelled out an ambitious programme to deal with these .
it also requires respect for the peoples of those member states to have any hope of success .
such respect bodes well for your presidency and for europe .
the treaty of lisbon is an excellent instrument for correcting any wrong turns taken by europe .
i am of course talking about president václav havel .
in any case , europe's freezing citizens understand what needs to be done .
the consequences of the communist regime's crimes are a repulsive scar on the face of europe .
ukraine's gas supply is cut off and russian tanks enter georgia .
two of the three main priorities of the czech presidency energy and the eastern partnership need gas .
we need you to design a comprehensive and decisive strategy .
cs making europe sweeter !
the reform treaty is essential .
fourthly , can the czech presidency really have authority unless and until the czech republic ratifies the treaty ?
in 1618 , an unpleasant habsburg diplomatic mission came to hradčany whose behaviour was unprecedentedly arrogant .
that is what europe's citizens are expecting , and you will not succeed by listening to these charlatans .
you should still be able to correct the german version .
thank you very much .
you made an undertaking to ratify the treaty of lisbon by the end of 200you did not and that was wrong .
happily , the polls indicate ayesmajority .
now , this will only be possible with the treaty of lisbon .
that europe gave its neighbours , including those in central and eastern europe , the prospect of accession .
it seems to be well prepared .
commission president barroso said that the eu is being put to the test in these six months .
these tests can be passed only if we all give of our best .
the european union is a community of values and a common system of law .
the czech president describes the climate change package as a silly luxury .
however , it would be a big mistake to turn away before addressing the long term causes of this problem .
the aim of the eu must therefore be to keep ukraine on the union's radar screen .
the czech presidency's priorities include energy security and reinforcement of the eastern partnership .
that is not only untrue , it is divisive and it is a breach of trust .
sv madam president , I , too , would like to welcome the czech presidency .
during this presidency , we will have low growth and unemployment will rise .
if europe is to be able to compete in future , we must invest in modern environmental technology .
this will provide a higher rate of growth and increased employment .
it is a similar situation with social policy .
this is why I believe that we need sustainable solutions in the energy sector .
we need a common european energy policy .
the need for concrete action aimed at establishing a common european energy policy is now greater than ever .
i wish the czech presidency every success .
i wish us all a successful czech presidency , notwithstanding the pluralism of our views .
they do not accept education systems which send them to the market of unemployment and social disdain .
they have a problem with the ratification of the treaty of lisbon .
it is the new generation that can understand what is meant by .
you mentioned the free movement of knowledge .
nowhere is that more important than in medical science , and that goes , too , for mental health .
i know you will do your best in that , and I wish you well in all your endeavours .
the czech republic is the first country of central and eastern europe to take the eu presidency .
if the documents are not credible , that fact should be drawn to the attention of the country concerned .
and what is a possible solution ?
when slovakia is eliminated from the ice hockey world championship and the czech republic qualifies for the next round .
madam president , I would like to extend the warmest estonian support for the czech presidency .
together we can reach an agreement at first reading on the directive on energy efficiency in buildings .
so , you must make up your mind eu or us ?
this realistic approach inspires optimism , and shows respect for democracy and the principle of unanimity .
on behalf of the delegation .
the president cut off the speaker . 
each country has its own tools and rules of the game for achieving ratification .
besides , we began to address the gas issue in mid december , during the french presidency .
my government is the first government that will meet the maastricht criteria .
i do not look on this as a race .
we must look for the tools to overcome a number of technical problems .
this is not a european dispute , although it is in fact starting to interfere with the accession talks .
we also appreciate the fact that we can tackle many problems .
what we value most of all is the internal liberal debate .
i would like to use this time to answer some concrete questions put to me , specifically on energy .
yes , we need more solidarity and more progress in terms of energy security in europe .
applause 
many of you spoke about the czech presidency and how important it is .
i am sorry but the czech republic is not a small country , even in european terms .
i wish the czech presidency all the best .
president klaus has been quite right to compare the european union to the old soviet union .
i wholeheartedly wish our southern neighbour a successful presidency !
in this respect , the union ought to maximise its efforts in facilitating access to available resources .
however , it has now become so militarised that humanitarian issues have now come to the fore .
not just the hamas militants who triggered the military conflict , but innocent children , women and men .
jews and palestinians can live peacefully side by side .
it has also resulted in significant economic losses , as the gas is also needed in manufacturing .
i cordially wish our czech friends success in bringing the aims of the eu to fruition .
indeed , these are social and economic problems at a european level that transcend borders .
on the contrary it could serve to deepen the economic and social problems facing us .
similar regulations apply in other european states too .
the czech republic holding the presidency of the council provides a good opportunity to re examine these statements .
it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a point of order .
in any case , deaf journalists may have some difficulty if you announce the results .
mr president , I agree with the position that mr speroni has put forward .
i recognise the difficulty you are in , but I would suggest that he is right .
to read out every amendment result would be very time consuming especially with a vote like we have today .
applause 
we will therefore move on to the vote .
situation of fundamental rights in the european union 2004 2008 
before the vote on the first part of paragraph 32
i will not go into the details , but the authentic version is the english version .
development of the un human rights council , including the role of the eu 
the next item is the vote .
we had wished to simplify things for you , but it is not possible .
better passports alone are not enough .
these are legal immigrants , semi legal immigrants but also illegal immigrants .
bg thank you , mr president .
i think it is time we drew attention to this .
cs the european arms market operates inefficiently because it is fragmented .
i hope that it will be very soon indeed , mr president !
fishermen face the highest incidence of serious occupational accidents and deaths .
this is a period when we should act together and avoid any moves that might undermine our unity .
the key idea of integrating eu countries must not be forgotten , not to mention ignored or rejected .
the european parliament does not , in other words , accept games with territorial and regional autonomy .
the report assumes an overly one sided political view of human rights in the union .
this is why I voted against catania's report .
unfortunately , this has not been so in several of the new eu member states in recent times .
in view of the intolerant climate in which part of this debate was held , it would seem so .
i see that he is applauding .
i suggest that this report could have done more for areas of disability that need more work .
so I could not support the overall report .
i am very much opposed to the charter of fundamental rights .
therefore the uk independence party meps voted against this report .
i agree with what has been said by mrs kinga gál .
i reject the notion that religious leaders should be restricted in their freedom of conscience and religion concerning homosexuality .
mr president , today we have just voted on the situation of fundamental rights in the european union .
that is why we abstained at the end of this vote .
last but not least , syed kamall !
i hope to remember them evermore .
of course this means a substantial expense running into millions of euros but one cannot compromise with security measures .
this report makes a hesitant step in that direction .
a strict , recurrent review of data security is therefore indispensable .
how old are the murdered palestinian children ?
such an exception is to be warmly welcomed .
taking fingerprints also comes at a price .
a visa will soon set you back eur at any rate , I take issue with the excessive use of fingerprinting or the use of biometric data .
is this not more trouble than it is worth ?
finally , I agree with the introduction into the law of a review procedure .
the protection of human health must prevail over industrial interests .
this substance is classified as a category 3 carcinogenic agent .
various alternatives to dcm based strippers are already available on the market .
i consider it imperative to apply european measures to prohibit or replace this substance .
i voted in favour of the report .
for these reasons , we are unable to vote in favour of this report .
moreover , family law is a member state competence and not an area of eu jurisdiction .
member states with legislation on same sex partnerships should move to recognise provisions with similar effects adopted by other states .
this ruling demanded that the pmoi should be taken off the eu terror list .
the situation is also similar in the other eu countries lithuanians have emigrated to .
for these reasons I voted for the 45th amendment .
in many respects I admire my own group's basic positions .
with reference to point 61 , however , I would like to say this .
separate issues arise , however , in relation to this report and this debate .
a debate on these is interesting .
violations have been identified , revealed , including for example in closed establishments accommodating children and elderly people .
the eu must follow the uk's lead and remove the pmoi from the terrorist list .
in many eu countries citizens , in particular the weakest ones , children are affected by discrimination and poverty .
i served on the temporary committee into extraordinary rendition by the cia .
i therefore voted to abstain on this report .
a positive attitude to abortion is inconceivable to me .
i voted in favour of the report .
i believe that human rights and democracy are key elements in the eu's external relations and external policy .
the commission was widely discredited due to several of its member countries having very dubious human rights records .
unfortunately , the positive elements are too few and far between .
the committee on foreign affairs also regrets the growing division of the unhrc into regional blocs .
none , of course .
thus , the existence of places of dialogue must be a policy to be stimulated and promoted .
it is above all to set out potential improvements in its operations .
the death penalty is a matter of conscience for each conservative mep .
finally , I hope that all this can be achieved by the end of this parliamentary term .
however , I would like to highlight one aspect .
the european council takes major political decisions and discusses very important and controversial issues .
the rapporteur , however , draws no distinction between these procedures .
in writing . nl I emphatically voted in favour of this report .
in writing . de I rejected this report .
the demands it makes go way beyond what I understand by transparency .
it is important to preserve legal protection of personality for meps , too .
in the interests of greater transparency , eu institutions should respect the principle of multilingualism .
i wish you a very warm welcome too , commissioner .
there are also extensive food shortages at all levels of the population .
the european union has been closely following the tragic events from the outset .
israel suffered through periodic rocket fire and the knowledge that its foe was amassing greater firepower .
we need to address broader and more complicated challenges .
unfortunately , we face a terrible and appalling conflict in gaza , which is now in its third week .
war , unfortunately , always produces immense human suffering , and this war is no exception .
second , we stressed the urgent humanitarian needs , which we said had to be met .
we think it is very important that very soon something works .
military operations can never bring a lasting peace only a negotiated political agreement can do this .
possibly it will come out debilitated militarily , but strengthened politically .
as the un secretary general has just reminded us , both sides must comply with this resolution .
applause 
it is a bloody conflict , and women and children are suffering particularly as a result of it .
it is entitled to defend itself against people whose aim it is to destroy the state .
a fundamental adjustment is needed , therefore .
there will have to be dialogue with hamas .
what was possible then can be possible also in future .
applause from the left 
applause 
the more civilian deaths , the more palestinian deaths , the less security in the region !
that there is the drama , the tragedy that is currently taking place in that region .
mr schulz is right israel needs to be protected from itself !
israel needs to be saved from the temptation of a solution that involves war and armed force .
it is not easy , but we must be clear .
free the palestinians from the israeli occupation of the west bank and the palestinians will free themselves from hamas .
applause 
a cease fire is what we want !
i think it is important , and that it is a strong message .
many thanks , mrs morgantini .
i would in this respect refer you to the lucid report in last monday's frankfurter allgemeine .
it is not the war that must be won today , but peace .
applause 
two or three hundred and how many israeli civilians ?
we must set out strict conditions to accompany the peace and development process in the middle east .
the answer is most certainlyno.
this was a tragic mistake !
applause 
for 17 days , they have been facing the enormous israeli war machine that is flagrantly violating international law .
i also express support for the peace forces in israel calling for an end to this war .
the un security council has adopted a resolution .
use the clauses in the association agreements .
i repudiate the propaganda of terrorism .
it is bordering on a humanitarian disaster and it requires immediate action .
by taking this position , we helped to destroy this joint government .
why are they voting for hamas ?
yes , the hamas rockets must stop .
israel is entitled to protect itself , but it has gone too far with these attacks .
we wish him every success with this important duty and with the challenge ahead of him .
mr obama is also taking this line as he says that he will talk to iran .
that is the result , the collateral damage of this attack on gaza .
we are here today to demand a cease fire and an end to the slaughter of civilians .
mr president , what is happening in gaza is heartbreaking .
that the devastation is perpetuated by a supposedly western nation is unfathomable .
there is no excuse there is no possible justification .
commissioner , we must vigorously and authoritatively take up the leadership in order to bring about peace .
the union for the mediterranean must play a major role , as must the euro mediterranean parliamentary assembly .
today , it is muslim public opinion , which extends far beyond the geography of the arab states .
there are all the un resolutions and the geneva conventions as well , however .
there will never be security without peace , or peace without justice .
when it comes to international law , there is no such thing as aget out of jail freecard .
the first is that an overwhelming majority of this parliament wants to bring about a quick ceasefire .
i strongly object to anyone trying to demonise a nation .
the conflict we are discussing today is an asymmetrical conflict .
today we are condemning israel .
it has something to condemn , it has authorities .
it is easy for us to talk , but very hard to take effective action .
ladies and gentlemen , would you want a terrorist organisation to fire 7 000 missiles from israel into gaza ?
he has until 5.20 p.m. at the latest , I have been told .
being a general , mr morillon will set a good example .
neither should the constant threat under which israeli children live be allowed .
but is there any other solution ?
the western powers did not create two states in 1948 , but they should do so now .
let us be more courageous in this strategy .
sl the israeli state has ordered the israeli army to destroy hamas in gaza .
and how can a ceasefire be achieved when neither party recognises the other's legitimacy ?
the road to lasting peace leads only through political negotiations .
we , from the comfort of our television sets , feel nauseated watching them .
we can no longer leave the fate of the civilians in the hands of the opposing sides .
israel is bombing and decimating a ghetto .
in this way , peace is being killed , and therefore we need to stop israel .
i address this comment to the president in office of the council , and to our fine commissioner , representing europe .
however , in the case of israel , we confine ourselves to statements and fruitless discussion .
we cannot be bystanders because that makes us complicit in the slaughter .
iran's foreign policy objective is to become the dominant regional power in the middle east .
it should be implemented without delay .
this is an issue of respect for international humanitarian law .
it is an issue of proportionality .
so they should .
our shame and also indignation are at so many lies , so much ambiguity and so much hot air .
when israel took non violent action , such as imposing blockades or cutting electricity , it was castigated .
we must consider each child's life to be of equal value , on either side of the border .
the israeli response is totally disproportionate and the deaths of young children are particularly shameful .
i have not , to date , opposed the new eu israel agreement .
in the last months , hamas still definitely behaved as a terrorist organisation .
i have seen it in africa .
i have seen it in ireland .
i have seen it in many places .
but first of all they have to stop acting as a terrorist organisation .
first of all , those who are on the spot will tell us clearly what they need .
this basically deals with how to organise peace and what is necessary .
our plan is based on what we found out then and discussed with our partners .
clearly , the eu alone cannot resolve this .
reawaken your basic humanity and you will see why hamas gains strength .
not only that , but hamas has consistently declined to recognise israel's right to exist .
palestinians need urgent access to food , medical aid and security .
israel must , at the very least , respect the principles of international law .
perhaps it can do so if it takes stronger measures than it has done so far .
so we are able to exercise that role .
is such action consistent with our own eu values of justice and democracy ?
this is probably the most important debate in which I have taken part .
da mr president , I just want to say two things .
i welcome the czech presidency , its priorities and its immediate and active involvement in the region .
the long term solution is a protected , secure israeli state , along with a sustainable palestinian state .
even before the recent immoral attacks , we saw years of collective punishment of the palestinian people .
both parties see only their own interest that is national egotism .
we are waiting here .
has it been deleted from the agenda ?
it is on the list of terrorist organisations and it is difficult to take action against it .
there is movement in any case .
i am committed to that as long as I am a member of this middle east quartet .
the debate is closed .
one news agency told a story of two children who were about to cross the road in gaza .
sadly , these shocking numbers will increase .
what will it take to have peace ?
how many civilian casualties will it take before there can be a true ceasefire ?
since that time it has not been possible to remember these victims together with the majority population .
at the very least , we need to join together to remember the victims .
un facilities have been attacked .
gas supplies by russia to ukraine and the eu debate 
the council and the commission were aware of the potential problem .
a further meeting of the gas coordination group on monday 19 january now looks likely .
allow me also to make a couple of final remarks in that introductory statement .
the dispute is not over yet , as we all know .
furthermore the eu needs to diversify its gas resources and supply routes .
this mechanism has had a considerable effect in mitigating the effects of the crisis .
the difference is that those oil crises were global while this is very clearly an eu crisis .
but I would like to stress particularly two issues that should be addressed immediately 
so I believe it is high time the gas flowed again towards the european union in stable conditions .
our group , the ppe de group , has supported this idea from the very beginning .
some of our recommendations have been addressed albeit belatedly in the commission's second strategic energy review .
this would not have done us any good , and indeed it is not doing us any good now .
these things will not happen overnight , but signals must be sent out .
we need many more interconnectors and interconnections .
the same is true of the gas reserves , of course .
we have to make common cause in this regard .
enough of this !
we cannot allow europe to be an innocent victim of a cynical power play .
we liberals have long been demanding a significant reduction of our dependence , our energy dependence , on russia .
now the european union is also being put to the test before its citizens .
let us not deceive ourselves russia is not concerned with a few dollars .
i hope that the plans the commissioner has presented will bear fruit .
there is now a need and a use for such people .
it is the price of our fanatical rejection of nuclear energy .
agreeing a level of how many dayssupply constitutes a reasonable reserve would be a good start .
there are huge savings to be achieved .
nl mr president , I can endorse the view of many fellow members .
we know that gas supplies are re negotiated every year , because ukraine and russia work with one year contracts .
russia and ukraine have dealt themselves and their reputations heavy blows .
what is obvious is that both countries have little awareness when it comes to customer friendliness .
however , gazprom has recently issued a demand for a huge price increase to unrealistic levels .
this means that unlike petroleum , there is no free market for gas in europe .
however , we do not know the facts of the situation .
the situation is also evidence of the european union's deficient energy policy .
the use of coal is opposed under environmental pretences .
to put it briefly , two parties two truths , no gas .
commissioner , I thank you for your proposals and efforts to find a solution .
de mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this is a dramatic situation , as we know .
how many times has russia attracted attention in this regard ?
i think that mr swoboda was right to ask this question .
what have we done to increase our support for nuclear power ?
the answer is far too little , far too timidly .
what have we done in the field of lng ?
we have the political capacity for that and we have need of cooperation .
it is a serious situation , as has been said .
sv mr president , the eu is the world's largest economic power .
now , as never before , it is clear that the eu must reduce its dependence on russian gas .
moreover , neither state was shown the expected path to membership in nato and the european union .
a compromise must be reached , gas supplies must be restarted , if russia has enough reserves to supply .
thank you .
but the other option we have at the moment is directly dependent on the will of the commission .
all these disputes combined place us in the middle of an energy war , which is about power sharing .
we need rules for a free energy market shared by our russian and ukrainian partners .
sanctions cannot work .
we managed to lower temperatures in europe and bring in a winter that has affected the entire continent .
no matter whether the reasons are technical , financial or political , this unprecedented gas embargo cannot be justified .
one other thing on energy solidarity .
firstly we must reduce dependency on gas , more and more of which will have to be imported .
this implies much improved and extended grids and pipelines .
what is the timing for this , commissioner piebalgs ?
this debate should send out a clear signal to russia and ukraine to immediately reinstate gas supplies .
both of these will result in our diversifying supply routes and exporting countries .
commissioner , your diagnosis of a lack of interconnection could not be more accurate .
we have to work on this , as it is , indeed , something we can do something about .
we have to interconnect the gas networks within the eu .
one of the main reasons this has not been done is that the licences are national .
ladies and gentlemen , commissioners , it is clear what we have to do .
the world is changing , and it simply needs to accept this fact .
the citizens of ukraine should not suffer just because their politicians have failed .
his political tone is too calm .
both are responsible !
hu madam president , I suggest that we speak clearly .
the present crisis is not only a test of our common energy policy , but also of eu solidarity .
i am going to give you an example where the council does not do that .
you must answer the european citizens as to why they are now sitting in the cold .
president in office of the council . madam president , firstly let me offer my apologies to you .
this is not a subject of the current debate we are discussing the emergency situation .
why not buy gas on the ukrainian russian border ?
but today , for example , we said that legal action must follow here .
that would help us to speak with one voice in a more active way .
secondly , for two years we have had energy diplomacy .
this is my second point .
we really should discuss how to guarantee security of supply under all possible conditions .
the vote will take place tomorrow thursday 15 january 2009 .
written statements rule 142 
the european union is facing , once again , a crisis with its supply of natural gas .
ukraine ?
we must expedite the process of diversifying supply sources and transit routes for natural gas .
in fact , accelerating the nabucco project is vital .
we must learn from the present crisis .
secondly , the gas crisis shows the political weakness of a divided , hesitant european union .
when under big pressure eu national governments rely , basically , on their own resources and sources .
as for oil stocks we should develop gas storage .
decision makers reacted to the turning off of the gas taps as if this had been completely unexpected .
we do not even need to know the real reasons behind russia's behaviour to draw our conclusions .
will the ideological opponents of atomic energy change their views ?
let us hope so .
we need to agree on a practical common policy on solidarity , security and diversification in energy .
the consequences of this crisis are humanitarian and economic .
we must start building the nabucco gas pipeline without delay .
everything has a positive side too , however .
i hope the spokesman is successful in strengthening that understanding .
i encourage the eu to diversify its energy package to avoid its dependence on one single natural gas provider .
i ask why should not it ?
this was reaffirmed by the reaction to russia's legitimate decision to suspend gas supplies .
if not , there is something wrong with integration .
russia has joined in the election campaign that is underway there .
so we should not delude ourselves this is only the start of the struggle for influence in ukraine .
without technical coordination between the two sides , gas cannot be supplied .
subject the rule of law and the judicial system in russia
the eu needs the new agreement , but so does russia .
moreover , my country has set three priority areas for its presidency of the council .
president in office of the council . I can give you a short answer yes !
with all these elections going on and changes of administration , how can we really kick start the wto talks ?
one of the priorities of the czech presidency is the common agricultural policy .
what measures will be taken by the czech presidency to negotiate the future of the common agricultural policy ?
ga madam president , I would like to thank the president in office for his answer .
quality of life also means , however , healthy food .
we did not have this five to ten years ago .
it is a question of elementary justice in the system , and it should be corrected .
at the same time , we believe that the cap should be reformed .
this is the only way to keep europe competitive .
i am sorry , minister , I was not sure if you had addressed both questions .
president in office of the council . I was trying to respond to both questions .
situation in the horn of africa debate 
there are several sources of tension in the horn of africa .
i will get to them in more detail .
another serious issue is the competition for natural resources such as water and minerals in the horn of africa .
there are also serious regional interdependencies .
i would also stress that improved regional cooperation would contribute to lowering tensions around national boundaries .
food security is another interdependency .
once again , regional cooperation could mitigate the effects of these natural events .
the pretext of the pirates was to levy a fishing tax on a ship in somali waters .
what is our engagement or involvement ?
this dialogue is principally pursued through the heads of the eu missions in the countries concerned .
this particularly concerns matters of governance and human rights .
i will let commissioner ferrero waldner elaborate further on that because that is the commission's responsibility .
i look forward to hearing your proposals and recommendations on this particular issue .
the commission will also continue to monitor the human rights situation and the democratisation process .
the commission remains seriously concerned about human rights violations and the precarious social and economic situation .
indeed , 2009 is a decisive year for the future of this country .
the sudanese authorities must respect their obligations as regards the facilitation of humanitarian aid and human rights activities .
failing to do so could turn the planned elections of 2009 into a scenario of renewed violence and conflict .
in somalia , the peace process is in a crucial phase .
the importance of this region transcends purely geographical bounds .
the conflicts and structural problems there are compounded by the negative phenomena in other regions of africa .
this practice is illogical , and makes diplomatic success practically impossible .
no developing country can work properly in the modern world if it rejects fundamental , universal values .
they create humanitarian disasters and paralyse the development of this strategically significant region .
each war , each conflict accentuates the fragility of the states .
this force needs a decent un mandate .
if not , ugandan and burundian forces will pull away from mogadishu leaving a security gap behind .
there is a momentum for change now in somalia that should be taken advantage of .
we must all have a common interest in a successful operation atalanta .
i also think that the horn of africa is possibly the poorest region in the world .
he was imprisoned without trial and , more than seven years later , has still not been formally charged .
the time for silent diplomacy is past .
enough is enough .
the european parliament is today demanding that dawit isaak and the other journalists imprisoned in eritrea be released immediately .
well , it was working for democracy and for the freedom of speech .
mr president , the horn of africa is pretty much an unmitigated disaster .
human rights are abused as a matter of course .
alarmingly , the situation could easily deteriorate further .
we have also debated the epidemic of piracy off the somali coast .
the people of somaliland benefit from a relatively benign government and progressive institutions .
the chances of the european union and the international community changing the basic reality in somalia are slight .
however , tackling one of its consequences , piracy , is much more within our grasp .
first I think I can assure you that , under the czech presidency , there will be continuity .
we will rather try to pursue the policy established by our predecessor in the best possible manner .
here the commission will provide full political , but also strong financial , support to the djibouti process .
we are very concerned about these tremendous challenges .
the participation of belarus will depend on its domestic development .
we need to see progress on media freedom , including internet freedom and the accreditation of foreign journalists .
progress is , however , a two way street .
a further issue for reflection is the potential to open negotiations on visa facilitation and a readmission agreement .
this would comprise the unblocking of the pca and a significant increase in our assistance .
this , however , will not be a one way street .
we might also mention the future opening of a european union representation .
i think that the european union should also go down the road of mutual understanding .
several such power plants are planned for the region in lithuania , estonia and poland .
the ball , as they say , is in minsk's court .
we cannot turn our backs on belarus .
today there is no permanent employment outside government structures everybody works on one year contracts only .
the eastern partnership initiative also opens new opportunities for the present authorities in belarus .
no .
in october , we decided to suspend the entry ban for president lukashenko .
experience has taught us that all dictatorships come to an end !
moreover , the several monthstrial period is drawing to a close .
today we are experiencing a fundamental change in the situation .
the true values at stake are energy , money and military strategy .
it is appropriate that the eu should make use of the current , albeit meagre , opportunities .
our task is to support and help unite the ngos and the opposition fighting for change .
as a result , a permanent representation of the european commission has been set up in minsk .
these are positive signals which without doubt are also the result of the european union's attitude to belarus .
it is not a liberal democracy in the european meaning of the word .
pl mr president , eu belarus relations depend on both sides .
the belarus resolution passed last year emphasised the need for a firm and conditional , yet positive policy .
no democratic country can function without a strong civil society .
an expensive visa and strict regulations do not punish the regime , but the population .
arrests and searches of the offices of opposition activists and human rights activists continue .
i have , with my colleagues , added paragraph 10 to the present european parliament resolution to this effect .
these should include a requirement for greater media freedom .
the media must be free to operate within the law and publish their material in the country .
however , we cannot stop fighting for the values on which the european union is founded .
the policy of sanctions against belarus started out as a fiasco .
progress can be seen in terms of the declarations made by the european union's members .
it is time to make a summary of the discussion .
firstly , on visa fees , which many of you have mentioned .
this is a problem of which we are particularly aware .
the presidency will also encourage a more coherent application of the existing rules by the member states .
i just can say that visa fees and visas for children are specific to each and every country .
we are not yet at the point of having one general agreement .
that , again , would have to be negotiated by the commission .
alexander milinkievich's opposition movementfor freedomhas finally been registered .
belarus has expressed willingness to participate in the eastern partnership .
commemorating 11 july as a day of remembrance for the victims of the massacre in srebrenica debate 
it is without a doubt the worst atrocity in europe since the second world war .
the eu will keep doing everything in its power to make this happen .
a lot of good endeavours have been carried out .
the commission fully supports the work of the international criminal tribunal for yugoslavia , the icty .
this is at the heart of our eu's efforts in the western balkans .
war , concentration camps , genocide never again !
we owe this at least , and the conviction of the perpetrators , to the victims and their families .
we are all aware of the carnage that occurred in srebrenica in 199a bosnian court heard last month from psychologists about how survivors of the srebrenica massacre are intensely traumatised .
srebrenica is synonymous with the ruthless and inhumane killing of children and adults it is synonymous with genocide .
i believe that not only mladić but also the other guilty parties must stand trial .
srebrenica is also a symbol for the failure of optimistic notions about humanitarian interventions and safe havens .
it should have been made clear from the start that a foreign military presence could only offer false illusions .
i do not want to go anywhere .
srebrenica , july 199 bg thank you , mr president .
we must all stop defending a unilateral position and applying double standards when assessing such horrifying events .
what have we yet to see and what is there still to say about srebrenica ?
it is something I will never , ever forget .
we have that helplessness and hopelessness that we perhaps shared .
i will never forget the mothers , the daughters , the families that I met over that period .
i hope that we can deliver something lasting and positive to them for the future .
thousands of women , children and elderly people were deported and a large number of women were raped .
i believe that all countries of the western balkans will support the recognition of this day .
our esdp mission in bosnia and herzegovina continues to provide support and assistance to the icty and relevant authorities .
we all thought that safe havens would be safe havens .
closure of the sitting
in many ways , I want to concentrate this morning on the fact that we have legislation in place .
therefore , we have much to do on this .
therefore , I cannot , as I have said , emphasise this enough .
can the commission give an account of which member states have forwarded their reports ?
will the commission consequently prepare a report on enforcement processes of the regulation in the member states ?
most member states have already submitted reports on animal transportation in 2007 to the commission .
this prevents a comparison of the data reported by the various countries .
in your speech , you described animals being transported for slaughter as of low value .
this is something I would very much like to know .
it is also important that we achieve proper enforcement of the legislation .
however , we should go further still .
we should not simply talk about a time limit .
i would like to know how this rest station project is progressing .
the point is that these long distance transports increase costs which are , ultimately , passed on to the consumer .
this was an area in which we were to improve the situation .
we need to revisit the conditions for animals during transport .
however , these long journeys also result in poorer quality meat .
this is not currently being done .
more and more animals are being transported within the eu .
they will , of course , be very much higher .
i would also like to ask mr špidla a couple of questions .
the problem is journey times .
that is what we need to address .
i am also talking about the transportation of horses .
mr president , following that may not be easy !
the commission , let us recall , failed to get its way in the 2005 regulation .
what figures do you have ?
what is the situation with regard to implementation ?
for example , what additional professional training in transport matters should trained farmers be undergoing ?
that , too , requires some thought .
these questions should be discussed and answered in further debates .
it is precisely in large companies that the worst kinds of animal abuse take place .
mr president , it is very important that animals are transported to ensure safety and to prevent avoidable suffering .
there is no possibility of taking an animal out to graze in the middle of the channel .
should we not make night time transport obligatory in the latter case ?
we have perhaps too many already that are choking the sector that is complying with them .
mr president , I would like to congratulate mr parish on bringing this forward .
mrs jensen spoke of 24 hours transport not necessarily .
mr allister , the agricultural industry has to ask questions itself .
to my mind , it makes no economic sense . it does not make humanitarian sense .
that would be in the interests of animal welfare and of human health .
horses , like people , feel apprehension , fear , and are able to trust humans .
he quite simply trusted her .
the owner beats the horse .
secondly , monitoring remains the achillesheel of this legislation .
monitoring by europe leaves something to be desired and is still very much organised at national level .
for me , that is an indication that the legislation is being applied very differently by the member states .
this makes you wonder whether these animals were to be transported in a ferrari .
i would therefore like to urge the european commission to look into this .
i know the commission can access that , but individuals cannot .
i submit that things have not really improved over the last 10 or 20 years .
guaranteeing the welfare of animals is something that is very important .
recurrent serious problems with animal transport are due to gross breaches of the law .
is it possible to enforce this legislation when there is international transport of animals ?
it is www.8hours.eu.
this care requires ..
the president cut off the speaker 
we should assess the situation in specific member states .
we should remember that this all has an impact on costs and on productive competitiveness .
the citizens of the european union are very sensitive ..
i would like to try and answer some specific questions .
the debate is closed .
mediterranean diet debate 
what is the mediterranean diet ?
recent medical research has also suggested it may help cut the risk of conditions such as dementia .
it is something that we need to take seriously in a world where everything seems to be uniform .
we in europe would do well to draw attention to the healthiest diet , namely the mediterranean diet .
its main component as the commissioner has already said is olive oil .
cattle produce methane , and that is bad for the global climate .
produce must return to being natural and free from additives and chemical preservatives .
the commission's white paper on obesity identified the mediterranean diet as an excellent natural medicine .
the president cut off the speaker 
good diet is especially important in children .
in my opinion , the location was decided correctly and reasonably .
this is a good start to the year in our plenary sittings .
restoring ntdtv television broadcasts to china via eutelsat written declaration 
budgetary control of eu funds in afghanistan 
when armed hostilities escalate such that international institutions are no longer secure , the situation is extremely serious .
loud applause 
before the vote 
pt I would like to propose a new paragraph before paragraph 1 that states as follows 
eu strategy towards belarus vote 
before the vote concerns paragraph 9 
for results and other details of the vote see minutes 
i welcome this european parliament resolution .
that is most important of all .
there is no obligation on employers to produce plans .
everything that was criticised therefore no longer appears in the resolution adopted and I wanted to make this clear .
only let us not stop half way this applies both to belarus and the european union .
i think there are no longer sufficient reasons to retain the system of sanctions in dealings with belarus .
written explanations of vote
we oppose the treaty of lisbon in principle .
our presence only prolongs the war and the resulting suffering , rather than eliminating them .
europeans must withdraw as quickly as possible from the afghan waspsnest .
there is continuing conflict or war , as well as tribal and international clashes , drug trading and corruption .
as a result , afghanistan needs international aid .
i would like to express my support for aid to afghanistan .
the eu needs to continue the support being given to afghanistan .
in writing . ukip fully supports equality for men and women .
during this current economic crisis , women are among those most affected by unemployment or salary cuts .
civil society organisations also have an important role to play in this .
trade unions should play an important role in this field .
unfortunately , exaggerated declarations and claims were passed in committee .
in writing . sv discrimination and harassment have no place in a liberal society .
it should not be just the committee on women's rights which raises these issues .
before we can look for a solution , hamas must stop its rocket attacks on israel .
president pöttering has been hasty in asserting that there were no votes against .
moreover , the only thing that this offensive will achieve is to intensify the conflict .
as well as their concomitant violence , two images from the demonstrations against the israeli intervention were particularly shocking .
in view of the seriousness of the situation in gaza , the european parliament could not remain silent .
lip service is insufficient in the face of such a severe humanitarian crisis .
we therefore remained opposed to the vote in support of israel's increased participation in community programmes .
this is totally unacceptable and must stop .
your actions mean that you have become the aggressor , not the victim .
thank you , mr president .
the situation in the horn of africa continues to be extremely concerning .
the delicate situation in this african region means that european institutions must take a decisive stance .
in writing . belarus remains largely ostracised by the european union due to president lukashenko's authoritarian rule .
this represents an explicit recognition that human rights and political freedoms are suppressed in belarus .
it has also been pointed out , though , that other dissidents are still behind bars .
legislation should also be changed and belarusians should be given freedom of movement .
or is it perhaps commercial considerations that stop us from doing this ?
the european union has greater expectations .
there is a need for symmetry and understanding between the partners in many fields .
this is understandable .
realism is an integral part of foreign policy .
however , realism cannot , need not and should not be divorced from values and strategy .
srebrenica is a wound that has left a deep scar on the history of europe .
seventeen years after the massacre , hundreds of bodies have yet to be identified .
it continued in europe with srebrenica and it continues today in gaza !
the memory of what we could have witnessed should be an integral part of our heritage .

iran the shirin ebadi case
and who can blame them ?
she defended the rights of iranian women and children , fighting to change divorce and inheritance laws in iran .
those who work there have been threatened , imprisoned and intimidated .
after all , as fellow human beings , her struggle is also our struggle .
this question should also be addressed to the council and the commission .
the iranian regime is potentially the biggest threat to world peace and the rule of law .
mr president , mr matsakis is right .
under the regime's critics , she enjoyed a privileged position for years .
unlike most other victims of persecution in iran , shirin ebadi is not anonymous but internationally known and respected .
it runs counter to the best , most noble traditions of one of the most ancient countries on earth .
i would also like to draw your attention to further arrests of university students in shiraz .
we must defend the independence of the student movement in iran .
we support the resolution .
i think that more radical action needs to be taken in this field .
ro iran provides perhaps the least documented cases of human rights violations within the international community .
it is encouraging that several resolutions have been proposed on this subject , initiated by several political groups .
this constructive criticism can only help relations between the european union and iran .
placing the people's mujahedin of iran on the list of terrorist organisations was a scandal from the outset .
the iranians themselves must perform this task .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , we have to condemn it !
we call on you to vote in favour of the joint resolution of the six political groups .
this dictator came to power following a coup d'état in 1984 and has been in power ever since .
the reaction from the outside world is one of confusion .
in fact , guinea has never enjoyed true democracy in its half century of independence .
in this case , the elections are to be held in two yearstime .
however , in practice , the officers start to exercise power and find that they like it .
this then leads to social oppression and revolts , as well as violations of human rights and democratic principles .
all this undoubtedly is of concern to the international community .
press freedom in kenya
mr president , kenya has a violent past .
the victors mainly belong to one major tribe , the kikuyu .
kenya has now lost that success story image .
president kibaki needs to realise that political stability and a free press are mutually reinforcing .
i hope that president kibaki will take our advice and change his mind .
these conventions include the right to freedom of speech .
i hope that those responsible for these incidents will be justly punished .
this is an utterly inconceivable situation .
lt why are we concerned with freedom of the press in kenya ?
this freedom is among the key european values and it cannot be called into question .
the debate is closed .
such fundamental pillars of democracy as freedom of speech and freedom of the press are not respected .
the free press is in serious danger .
state control and censorship were sections of a draft amendment to a communications bill .
that is far from a democratic society .
this must be done as soon as possible .

the report will therefore be put to the vote on thursday .
the next item is one minute speeches on matters of political importance .
why is this important ?
thank you very much , mr president .
i am a supporter of care for the environment and of action to protect nature .
in making the decision , were their lives considered at all ?
its journalists were imprisoned , and those who came to their aid were manhandled in the street .
handicapped citizens cannot use these cards in all eu member states .
as an example , this makes it difficult for them to park their cars in designated parking spaces .
bg this week a referendum will be held in switzerland on the free movement of people .
i am concerned .
i asked to speak because of a tragic accident that occurred three days ago in croatia .
such views and talk can only support russia's policies and its special forces .
ladies and gentlemen , here is a one minute rapid snapshot of the still rampant european racism .
the police forces are sweeping through roma families with helicopters , dogs and armed police officers .
thank you very much .
every day , companies announce cutbacks in production , layoffs of workers or even complete closure .
the competent european commissioner confirmed that the cannons had not been purchased out of the schengen fund .
it would appear , however , that some people need to hear this message again .
only a share of eur 20 million earmarked from billions for projects !
all this after a big gas crisis !
as you know , bulgaria was most seriously affected and is the only country completely reliant on russian gas .
we were supported by 254 members of parliament from 25 different member states , which was huge support .
we acknowledge the fundamental rights and freedoms of european citizens .
it is imperative that there be a positive outcome to it soon .
european citizens expect the european union to protect them and to offer them practical assistance .
in this resolution , it called for the fate of the missing persons in cyprus to be ascertained .
ro given the current climate in europe , guaranteeing energy security is becoming a priority .
this project is of paramount importance .
in addition , it is high time the european union had these things checked by inspectors .
this military solution is fraught with problems .
around 30 to 40 million m3 of trees have been brought down .
this is a hugely important round .
in april or may there will be elections in india .
we have one new administration in the united states .
maybe a visit to the committee on international trade would prove appropriate .
i do not feel that this is an adequate distinction , clearly , but it is interesting .
were the doha round to be concluded , it would be a disaster for all nations .
you can be assured of my whole hearted support in your efforts to reach a rapid agreement .
if we are open , then they need to be open too .
what can we expect from china ?
that is why it is important to proceed with the multilateral doha negotiations .
these are important issues that we are talking about here .
country after country introduced duties , quantitative restrictions ,buy domesticrules and competing devaluations .
there is actually a high risk of this state of affairs being repeated this time round .
the eu is the largest trading bloc in the world and therefore has considerable responsibility .
thank you for the opportunity to speak .
the failure of the doha round will probably never be more costly than it is right now .
we have seen this throughout history .
i think we should remember that .
we are concerned about it , as we should be .
there is a danger that protectionism will increase because of the current world economic crisis .
i also think that it is precisely providing services that teaches management , cooperation and good standards .
in connection with this , the accent on opening the market to services is very important for both sides .
i could not agree more with that .
it is about production and employment in the textile and clothing sector in various european member states .
what measures does the commission intend to adopt to protect production and employment in the textile and clothing sector ?
what is the current situation regarding the proposed regulation onmade inlabels ?
by promoting a process of gradual change , we have helped the sector adapt .
the right political responses are not to close our markets or monitoring of the imports .
the challenges for the sector predate the current slowdown .
eight of the fifteen applications under the globalisation adjustment fund have been to support textile workers .
however , let us not undermine this industry's capacity for recovery by being lax and negligent .
almost 20 000 workers may become unemployed .
moreover , china and other countries are constantly increasing market access barriers affecting eu products .
as we all know , the double checking system is no longer in operation .
as stated by mrs wortmann kool earlier , 350 000 jobs have been lost over the past two years .
the french government has already developed a system of additional credit insurance for the clothing and textile sector .
it is simply a matter of political will and coordination .
i believe that it is probably wrong just to apply protective measures .
it is specifically designed to help small businesses address issues of defence .
the commission statement on the consequences of the recent gas crisis 
i believe that we should not remain idle on this transit issue .
what are the lessons to be learnt ?
it has revealed , for the third time , the need for a common energy policy .
in particular , the objective of 20 % energy efficiency will have to be made binding .
the task is to predict the future of the european union's energy supply .
to do this , ambitious objectives must be set with regard to the fight against climate change .
now , at what level ?
their carbon footprint is of absolute importance and I know that the industry is working on this .
the second level is ict as an enabler across the board and in all sectors of economic activity .
one of the pilot projects being put into action now is the intelligent transport system .
the implementation of the nabucco project is exceptionally important in this regard .
i think that this laperrouze report is of sufficient quality as to eliminate the need for any substantial amendments .
security of supply and solidarity among the member states must be at the heart of the european energy policy .
my own personal opinion is that we do not need nuclear energy .
upfront , there are costs .
mrs laperrouze next recommended diversifying the sources and routes of supply .
not one of these issues has been resolved , and yet the commission is now launching this pro nuclear offensive .
mr president , commissioners , solidarity is a lovely word .
it generally belongs to the vocabulary of the left .
in practice it will not be done with reference to the lowest prices , but some average prices .
in that case there will be losers those countries with cheap electricity .
the recent gas conflict between russia and ukraine by no means left the european union unscathed .
this is pre eminently a matter for the member states to decide , rather than the eu .
more clarity on this in the report would have been welcome .
under article 36 of our accession treaty we have the right to start reactivating this nuclear power station .
even small contributions from biofuels result in less dependence on fossil fuels and a change in prices .
i must also emphasise the issue of nuclear power .
i would like to conclude on that note .
i call on the commission and member states to promote and finance research projects aimed at improving energy efficiency .
this is totally unacceptable .
this is totally unacceptable .
thank you .
there have so far been neither safeguards nor guarantees and these have yet to appear .
we have a very clear long term energy strategy for the whole of the european union .
we have had very heated debates about it .
as long as we do not set priorities , we shall never allocate money wisely .
we must begin with the efficiency of buildings , vehicles , fridges and so on .
where is there room in all of this for blind loyalty to nuclear power ?
i have to say , commissioner , that you cannot even get your sums right .
just look at the facts !
not a penny for town twinning !
not a penny for solar energy , and not a penny for biomass !
the recent gas crisis has shown that this is an extremely important task .
this decision undoubtedly weakened the energy self sufficiency not only of slovakia , but also of the european union .
you are nodding , commissioner I see that we are in full agreement here .
we will need to apply a lot more energy and brainpower to solving the problem of waste and disposal .
in fact the opposite is true .
the eu has the chance to show its effectiveness and to gain new strength .
it may also show its passivity and risk marginalisation .
we must have smart grids and smart houses .
this would not be the case with smart grids .
in this way we could also cooperate with neighbouring countries in the mediterranean .
the reason for such a step on our part is very simple .
what does it mean ?
let us finish the legislative procedure during the next three months .
it is very important for us .
fi mr president , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , we have history behind us .
this is thus a very serious issue .
people and companies do not know about the energy they are consuming without smart technology .
we find it odd that ukraine is a transit country .
they are crucial to the task of transforming buildings from being energy consumers into being net energy producers .
this is an important issue for the future .
the baltic sea is one of our most sensitive inland seas .
the european parliament has also expressed its doubts about this on a previous occasion .
firstly , the european union does not have an energy strategy .
it is , unfortunately , damned hard , which is why the answer is so varied .
that would be irresponsible .
by intelligent , I mean varied , and being open to new things and not standing still .
the answer is technology .
no , it is the private sector that will have to do that .
we are not speaking with one voice .
the president cut off the speaker 
ideas have already emerged regarding potential alternatives .
thank you very much .
there is a need for a more intensive dialogue with producer countries , transit countries and other consumer countries .
cooperation should be increased with the countries of the middle east , the mediterranean region and north africa .
however , solidarity among the member states is essential for the survival of the eu itself .
the eu must immediately adopt effective legislation to help overcome energy supply crises or avoid them altogether .
how is this consistent with eu member state solidarity , the common energy policy and energy security ?
the smart grid will allow solar , wind and hydro generated electricity to level the security graph .
i called upon the european commission then to take firm action .
the second issue is the capacity for energy storage .
ireland's dependency is extremely high 91 % of our needs are imported .
the european union will give added value to the initiatives developed by the member states .
we hope for your understanding .
meeting the need predominantly from non renewable sources of energy is beginning to outweigh environmental acceptability .
in connection with this europe does not have a more or less unified price .
are we also considering , within the southern corridor , the white stream caspian georgia black sea ukraine romania project ?
but I believe that the debate definitely shows that the rapporteur has struck the right balance .
on the third internal market package , I would just say what it does for europe .
that will solve a lot of issues .
second , a european body for transmission system operators .
what is the council discussing ?
that should give enough legal and regulatory clarity for investing in the nabucco pipeline .
i have heard some criticism that the euro recovery plan is not about efficiency .
then energy efficiency will not only be about speeches but also about facts .
what are the energy sources ?
i believe that we have set some very ambitious targets for 20it is quite clear that a large share has been allocated to all renewable energy sources .
energy matters are the greatest challenge of our times .
both countries must take responsibility for the fact that member states did not receive gas .
europe , for its part , must diversify energy sources and improve supply security .
this requires interconnections .
it is also necessary to improve energy efficiency , especially in the new member states .
the eu needs to break out of its own vicious circle at last .
this is about much , much more than energy !
a pole is wise after the event ! 
development impact of economic partnership agreements epas short presentation 
economic partnership agreementsreally is quite a mouthful , particularly in german .
we are trying to link together trade and development , by which I mean trade policy and development policy .
apart from the two deletions , my draft report is identical to the first draft .
the commission does not see our commitment to the epa process ending on signature .
unfortunately we are still a long way away from them .
the territory of europe is too small to have zones that are off limits to its citizens .
most of these live in the soil or in rotting timber and are highly sensitive to changes .
but , despite the fundamental importance of preserving biodiversity , progress to date has been limited .
it is also important to add one clarification to the report .
a conference will take place in prague in may 200for this reason , the commission considers the european parliament resolution timely .
thank you very much to the rapporteur .
i wish to outline two things here 
in writing . wilderness can mean different things to different people .
europe's biodiversity is the most precious legacy which we can leave future generations .
these parks are part of the protected area network pan .
the solutions range from optimising the use of existing capacity to perhaps revising the regulations on slots .
the fourth and last point refers to the environmental sustainability of this area of activity .
over two thirds of all aircraft certified in the eu are in this sector .
general and business aviation mainly comprises small and medium sized enterprises .
the regulations need to be adapted to this specific nature , without , however , compromising safety or security .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
however , to make the most of it , we need to establish the proper regulation .
this is true of commercial air transport and business and general aviation .
the continuing growth in business aviation , however , is clogging up the airports in use more and more .
the aim must be nothing less than emission free air traffic .
the men and women who are today involved in establishing inter generational solidarity networks deserve recognition .
their determination is an important contribution to national and european wealth and to the common good .
it is therefore necessary to assess this value in an explicit and positive manner .
the european union must create a political framework in order to achieve this target .
economists use mathematical models to highlight the value of housework .
ignoring this fact means maintaining the ideas of the past .
we would like to congratulate parliament on the very important work done .
discrimination based on gender is still a reality , unfortunately , even in the european union member states .
one of the european union's key values is to eliminate any form of discrimination .
one of the fields in which women are hugely underrepresented is scientific research .
thank you !
however , it is not the case if one of the parents carries out this work .
successfully balancing professional and personal life is starting to become a strenuous task for women .
in this area the eu could indirectly contribute and help member states to modernise their policies .
i congratulate mr harbour on his work .
we can only make a difference if we work together .
driving innovation and developing the knowledge economy are key in ensuring sustainable high quality public services .
agenda of the next sitting see minutes
the sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m. 
i am also grateful to all the ngos and institutions that have followed our work closely .
we therefore need to roll it out across all 27 member states .
the development of the internet is contributing to the proliferation of new threats for our children .
that said , parliament is still not satisfied , and mrs angelilli's report is evidence of this .
i must say that I am not satisfied either .
we must also resolve the question of extraterritoriality by taking a joint european approach .
eighty per cent were female , and child abuse domains totalled more than 3 000 .
on the other side , the international cooperation of law enforcement authorities is limited .
in this field there is a lot to do .
thank you .
there are three points in this report which I believe are in need of improvement .
we can only combat this abuse successfully by attacking it at the roots .
however , I do not approve of making internet service providers into an extension of the law enforcement agencies .
this must be a legally binding obligation .
supporting the victims of this reprehensible business , and of their families , is also an important matter .
this is actually about the rights and the protection of children and young people .
however , the protection also has to involve the children themselves .
the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography are abhorrent crimes , the prevention of which requires international cooperation .
the explosive increase in criminal activities via the internet requires a coordinated approach .
moreover , I would like to argue in favour of strengthening cooperation with europol and eurojust .
we must make sure that child safety becomes a central issue in all eu member states .
mrs angelilli's excellent report contributes to this effort , and we support it with our vote as well .
we must be able to protect our children before they become victims .
thank you .
ro sexual exploitation of children and child pornography are very serious crimes .
there have even been attempts to form paedophile political parties .
this must fill every decent citizen of the european union with horror .
that is why I am strongly in favour of the report .
to some extent , the adage of our german friends , einmal ist keinmal , applies here .
the free movement of people in the european union gives them greater scope for doing so .
mr president , I would also like to congratulate mrs angelilli for her very fine report .
i therefore thank mrs angelilli for her report .
rapid crime detection and strict enforcement of penalties are imperative .
cooperation is needed from the media .
indeed , there are even specious notions about so calledgood paedophilia . 
provision also needs to be made for improving the living conditions of victims .
a stranger arouses interest .
it is such a simple message .
we had a recent case in ireland which highlighted this .
we live in a world where the risks for children and adolescents are continuously growing .
child exploitation , including the sexual exploitation of children , is among society's biggest ills .
the battle against this phenomenon requires much common effort and an integration of measures , methods and resources .
the age limit for sexually motivated crime should also be harmonised .
it will be easier to carry out investigations and bring charges .
i have also had questions on extraterritoriality .
there is also a need for tools .
i would add that , last week , we had a very nice data protection day .
he really has provided much food for thought and , above all , practical commitment .
firstly , there is a lack of data .
written statements rule 142 
low barriers of entry and minimal risk are making it very easy for criminal organisations to get into cyberspace .
in writing . exploiting children in any way is unacceptable .
practical actions are needed because of the increasing evidence of sexual exploitation of children .
children are often unable to understand the seriousness and consequences of a situation .
the commission can , however , support this compromise without hesitation .
personally , I do not see any drawbacks .
they are appropriate in an instrument intended to match the ambitious european policy to combat illegal immigration .
no doubt there are various views on how to resolve this and other problems in this draft .
some of these will be decided when it comes to their implementation .
this , therefore , requires specific education within the bodies that deal with these issues .
what exactly did we achieve by way of this law ?
what we did was to attack one of the main sources that motivate people to turn to illegal immigration .
as of now , this will be absolutely impossible .
claudio fava deserves our congratulations on this in particular .
this pressure is considerable , and rightly so , frankly .
that too , my group will accept .
we still have a long way to go though , so what we must do now is persevere .
this is , quite frankly , unacceptable , in my view .
and yet , economic migration also concerns many eu member states , especially those which acceded more recently .
we have no guarantee that member states will ensure that people are paid .
it is clearly a problem that has been over exaggerated .
what was needed was another measure one that regularised the situation of these millions of people .
instead we have a directive that carries on where the return directive left off .
with this directive , the exploited pay more than the exploiters .
we needed something different .
we needed a measure to curb xenophobia .
british jobs for british workers cannot be guaranteed all the while we are inside the eu .
the prospect of british taxpayers funding foreign workers is , frankly , unacceptable .
well , it is not surprising is it ?
we are not protectionists , but we want good common sense .
we want to control our own borders and decide who lives , works and settles in our country .
it is important for us to make it clear that illegal employment will no longer be tolerated .
however , we must not forget that migrants without residence permits will ultimately have to be deported .
sv I would like to begin by thanking claudio and everyone else who made this report possible .
of course , this should be done not only through those seeking work but also through those offering it .
that , therefore , is our reason for wholly welcoming this directive .
they protect workers so that they can report the situation in which they find themselves .
cases of slave labour occur , under conditions of exploitation and child labour .
this is why the right of trade unions to represent the interests of these workers is so important .
coordinated action by all the countries of the eu is needed to tackle every aspect of illegal employment .
the financial penalties are enough of an incentive to be careful in the selection of employees .
last year alone , there were no fewer than 12 000 in as small a country as belgium .
i therefore agree with combating illegal work across the european union .
of course , this must form part of an overall policy on migration and immigration .
this is cowardly and unhelpful .
we have already seen this in the case of many reports and actions .
there is , of course , one thing that we can be sure of .
the most important issue is to protect the people in these employment relationships from exploitation .
however , the authorities must put in place more controls and prosecute those suspected of committing offences .
the report is a compromise between the council and the european parliament and specifies minimum standards .
nevertheless , the prospect of member states strengthening or weakening the requirements is not inspiring .
we have taken the first step forward .
el madam president , the rapporteur claudio fava and the shadow rapporteurs truly deserve our hearty congratulations .
at long last , the employment of illegal immigrants has been criminalised .
multiple , balanced and realistic sanctions are provided for in the directive .
however , special care must be taken for all those illegal immigrants who are already in the european union .
it was no easy task and the path was strewn with pitfalls .
sv we know that more and more people are hiding within the eu's borders .
we know that many people without documents are exploited and live in miserable conditions .
this will reduce the chances of finding a decent life in europe .
i would like to say to mrs segelström that we do not have a conservative government in sweden .
it must be made clear that working legally is the only way to work in europe .
furthermore , unregistered workers do not benefit from health insurance or pension rights .
this is what we know as modern slavery .
we need to be firm , to send out a clear message .
the president cut off the speaker 
pl madam president , I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur .
i travelled to italy , to foggia , as soon as the so called work camps were discovered .
in the latter , both union citizens and illegal immigrants were living and operating in appalling circumstances .
nonetheless , the law is not working .
do not complain that the union .
the president cut off the speaker 
it is my belief that this directive represents a step in the right direction .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding work .
we must also ensure that this kind of behaviour is appropriately punished .
however , I would like to draw your attention to the complexity of the current situation .
these sectors use illegal labour to an alarming degree .
should he or she report the matter to the police , or terminate the contract ?
the employer would not be in a position to provide the relevant evidence .
alternatively , it may be that it will be used to sanction employers unfairly and unjustifiably .
i have received representations from constituents , so I welcome action on this matter .
in fact , rather than interfering , it actually puts things in order .
they can easily procure a cheap labour force .
i have in mind , for example , work in poland for citizens of ukraine .
i would also like to thank mr fava and parliament once again for having enabled this compromise .
we must , of course , fight against illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings .
thank you as well for the quality of this debate .
i am thinking of the temporary residence permit for minors who have been exploited .
jobs in france must be reserved for the french , while jobs in europe are reserved for europeans .
at the same time , we need to be aware of the future risks which we are exposed to .
i would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the fine job he has done .
close cooperation is undoubtedly needed in order to combat illegal immigration .
this does not , however , mean that the directive is only about penalising employers .
i trust , too , that these provisions will be effectively implemented by the member states .
extension of the ec usa agreement for scientific and technological cooperation 
in my view , it is not a good system , but that is the current tool .
general and business aviation 
thank you , mr president and mr zaleski .
combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography 
we shall now proceed to the vote .
we are all aware that russia remains one of our most important and also most difficult trading partners .
one way of tackling this would be to free ourselves from dependency on russian raw materials .
they were rejected .
there are small airports , there are medium sized airports and there are large international hubs .
we do not want the european union to be a massive airport structure .
the prejudices of the last century are deepening the demographic crisis .
mr president , thank you for your patience and indulgence .
let me take the opportunity to explain why I voted against the greens and their amendment .
work of a nursing , caring , educating and teaching nature should be properly valued .
principles supporting effective protection of intellectual property and equitable sharing of intellectual property rights are actively promoted .
after setting up the european institute of technology , this transatlantic scientific and technological cooperation will generate new opportunities .
i would like to see included also other cutting edge fields , such as stem cell research .
this applies especially to biotechnology .
finally , I applaud the addition of space research and the security sector to the ec / us agreement .
principles supporting effective protection of intellectual property and equitable sharing of intellectual property rights are actively promoted .
the last few days have borne witness to russia's serious unreliability as a trading partner .
it is indeed essential to renew the agreement drawn up with the soviet government years ago .
these are distinct .
to take an example , europe is too small to have forbidden areas for its citizens .
most areas in europe which are wilderness are protected under natura 2000 .
there are also many species that have not yet been discovered and described .
most of these live in the soil or in rotting wood and are highly sensitive to change .
the same precepts demand that interventions and regulations be balanced and considered .
moreover , the ethical reasons for this decision must not be forgotten .
the term wilderness refers to a natural environment that has not been significantly altered by human activity .
there is a difference between the notions of conservation and protection .
the former involves proper use of nature .
this can be exploited in an environmentally friendly manner by developing new products in the area of tourism .
i am impressed with the commission's commitment to proportionality in the regulation of general and business aviation .
this can be altered through what is known as pre commercial procurement .
europe spends usd 2.5 billion .
pre commercial procurement will address this anomaly .
this is most unfortunate if we really want to strengthen our innovative potential .
one example of a solution developed on the basis of public procurement is the gps navigation system .
for smes , public procurement represents a valuable opportunity to gain experience .
we must capitalise on the benefit which we will gain from a pre commercial procurement policy .
we need to follow the example of the us and focus more on procuring research and development services .
we must define a beneficial pre commercial policy instrument in order to boost the eu's innovative base .
there are pros and cons .
the nuclear debate is never ending .
one cannot fail to take note of the possibility of evaluating this energy supply .
i am informed that malta was considering the importation of energy generated from nuclear plants in france .
we do not have a single european energy policy .
each state defends its own interests .
due to the issue of global warming , coal cannot be considered atransitional component.
the diversification of energy supplies assumes that there are gas and oil pipelines to transport resources to the eu .
the tbc and nabucco projects are affecting the political stability of our neighbours .
as it stands currently , I am voting against this report .
the diversification of energy sources and suppliers cannot remain a matter for the member countries themselves .
only a united europe is strong and competitive in an age of rapid globalisation .
i greatly valued mrs laperrouze's work and have therefore voted in favour of its adoption .
in this context there are , however , repeated indicators suggesting that it is more permanent than transitory .
it is an enormous challenge , but it is a strategic issue which we cannot ignore .
the need for clear definitions across the european union on energy poverty is also important .
the concept ofworkhas to be given a wider interpretation .
at the very least , all full time motherswork must be credited for contributory pension purposes .
i voted in support of this report despite some misgivings and concern with the overall thrust of the report .
we must do everything that we possibly can to achieve gender equality .
there are also wordings that open the way for a common tax policy .
the household economy deserves a more important role than the one currently allocated to it .
the value of this integration work amounts to almost one third of the national income in germany .
we need more jobs which are suitable for older people .
we must put it into practice .
i hope that in six monthstime , we will be able to provide it with an explanation .
the report was unanimously approved in the committee on women's rights .
the entire left wing spectrum in the european parliament voted for the alternative resolution .
it was definitely a step in the wrong direction .
i voted in favour .
in particular , it is important that information about offenders is coordinated and updated regularly .
we conservatives therefore voted in favour of the report .
these common sense proposals aim to protect the most vulnerable members of our societies .
i am voting in favour of the angelilli report on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography .
this is wholly in accord with my view of the eu as a union of values .
i have therefore voted against the report as a whole .
we have little data about how extensive it is .
the large majority of victims of human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation are children and adolescents .
child pornography is a delicate subject which should always be a main focus for european and national authorities .
european union member states should severely punish any kind of child sex abuse and any kind of online grooming .
in addition , indecency offences involving children should fall within extra territorial criminal legislation .
a computer game cannot replace talking to one's grandmother .
the natural family is the space for protection of children , and parents are their first protectors .
member states must ensure that the legislation will be amended so that websites with criminal content are blocked .

the presidency expressed this sentiment through a statement which was issued shortly after president obama signed the executive orders .
these welcome developments will enable us to strengthen even more transatlantic cooperation in the area of countering terrorism .
the decision to close guantánamo is , of course , primarily the responsibility of the united states .
in his executive order to close guantánamo , president obama ordered a review of the status of all detainees .
we have raised these issues in the framework of the political dialogue with the united states .
the european parliament has played an important role in raising awareness of this issue .
at present , the us has not made a formal request .
as mrs ferrero waldner repeatedly says , positive cooperation is required .
we have to work together with the member states to put this in place .
mr president , that is what I have to say on my own and mrs ferrero waldner's behalf .
it concerns the cia using european countries for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners .
only the investigative instruments and resources of the member states will be sufficient for the task .
parliament has also requested an assessment of national anti terrorist legislation .
i am sure that it is equally warmly welcomed by this parliament .
the european union is committed to the absolute prohibition of torture and of cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment .
the position of this parliament was clearly expressed in your resolution of february 200let us look forwards rather than backwards .
some people allege that the prisoners have been tortured .
this is a reason for accepting them , under the dictates of humanity .
it is without doubt true that torture is the most inhumane and degrading practice .
we must also do that in this case .
we lack the open debate and the collective change of will which american democracy allows .
yet , too often , member states from our union were complicit in what the bush administration did .
the united states must prosecute suspects , where sound evidence exists and in accordance with the rule of law .
if asked , should not europe offer those few citizens the rights and freedoms that no other country will ?
europe has to speak with one voice and play its part in ending this affront to justice .
three things are absolutely certain regarding this matter .
we are certainly bound to remove our citizens and residents from the camp .
mr president , my group welcomes the remarks made by minister vondra about guantánamo bay .
would you ask the us now who the inmates are ?
although I was pleased with the remarks about guantánamo bay , I am a little dismayed at the cia .
we are hesitating and starting a shameful period of horse trading .
what has happened to our call for the universality and indivisibility of human rights ?
we cannot really be saying that we want to preach one thing and do another .
thank goodness for that .
they should be tried and acquitted or convicted , released or punished .
why ?
can we be asked to take that risk in the eu ?
member states have shown different degrees of willingness to take former inmates .
therefore I require , and we require , that such decisions are consulted with other eu members .
we ask and what about the citizensright to know ?
assuming the alde group accepts my advice , we will neither table nor support any amendments to this resolution .
i just want to deal with a couple of things .
i must remind the house once more that terrorism is a global threat that also affects union citizens .
the american people have done so through the polls .
if there is proof against any of them , they should be tried .
thank you very much .
i believe this is the case for most people here .
now that the decision has been made , let there be no mistake about our position .
they have been locked up illegally by the bush administration , which clearly violated international law .
it is , therefore , first and foremost an american problem that needs to be solved by washington .
this is based purely on assumptions .
es mr president , guantánamo is a problem that was not created by the european union .
yet it is clear that we did not create it ourselves .
the prisoners of guantánamo cannot be dealt with as if they were an undifferentiated herd .
they are people with rights , but also with their own personal stories .
i entirely agree with messrs schulz and watson .
the first point of the resolution mentions the important changes in united statespolicy concerning humanitarian laws .
el mr president , the inhumane prison at guantánamo should never have been opened .
if we do not do this , we risk being irrelevant in the process of closing guantánamo .
it is not acceptable to say now that this problem is not our business .
however , mistakes have been committed and controversial decisions have been made in the name of this desired objective .
the romanian parliament has carried out an investigation and supplied the results to the interested parties .
we look away we turn our back .
for this reason , we must make it clear that the question of credibility is of great political importance .
european responsibility for violations of the rule of law and human rights cannot be erased .
guantánamo should never have been created and it needed to be closed .
the position of the european parliament on terrorism is equally clear .
it is a fact that the united states has shouldered most of the burden in the fight against terrorism .
the united states undertook to defend the free world on behalf of us all .
europe needs to feel responsible for the war on global terrorism .
no means deemed inadmissible under signed international conventions may be used .
that should put an end to the debate on secret prisons and transit flights .
he was seized in the border areas between afghanistan and pakistan .
he is a geologist who was working there .
we can decide ourselves to sign a bilateral agreement with the us , as portugal has done .
cohesive leadership is now needed from the irish government in this regard .
mr president , the eu has been asking for the closure of guantánamo for a long time .
mr president , the prison at guantánamo bay was a necessary creation of the united states at the time .
its closure is now a matter for the united states .
the martin report is the best example of this approach .
europe must learn to speak with one voice and to take united action .
one the one hand , there is the legal position .
i believe that citizens of a country should be readmitted into their country of origin .
the union is now a unit , and this problem must therefore be considered .
it has a moral and political dimension , but also a security and legal dimension .
it is certainly more complex than that .
graham watson spoke of the need to approach this with one voice .
but if we do receive a request , we need to be prepared to react .
this is one level .
i think we should be aware that the discussion has only just begun .
it has only been one week .
a clear position of the respective member states on the resettlement of detainees is not yet known .
that is absolutely essential .
we could then possibly add financial assistance to facilitate reception in some member states .
the debate is closed .
the speculation mentioning romania in connection with the cia's secret prisons is totally unfounded .
no one has been able to prove their existence in romania .
you have specifically raised the situation on the islands of mayotte and lampedusa .
we should take care to distinguish between the two types of migratory flows in these two cases .
until now , the legislation and practice regarding detention in the member states has varied considerably .
it also , through the most recent legislation , sets commonly agreed standards on return policy .
our asylum and migration policy is thus rooted in the rule of law .
it ensures respect for human rights and for the dignity of the individual .
i am relying on the efforts of mrs ferrero waldner to achieve a quick result in the current negotiations .
those are the remarks I wished to make to you .
this is a percentage which is unknown in our european countries , thank god .
the french authorities are well aware of these difficulties .
we often have 180 days of detention , including for those who are fleeing from political persecution or war .
1 200 people died in 2008 when trying to cross the mediterranean .
and this is quite apart from enforcement .
it is something that is included in your press releases .
in the next few days , my group , too , will organise a delegation that will visit lampedusa .
the period within which the member states have to transpose these directives into legislation is two years .
the issue of immigration is urgent , though , and a two year period is too long .
it is shocking that the reception situation at lampedusa should need to be discussed in this manner again .
i would therefore call on the council presidency to make this a priority .
the detention centre was not built to cope with this capacity .
we have known this for three years .
it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , nothing in this house surprises me any more .
i am sorry that he is not here in the house .
what is the consequence of this ?
76 requests were examined in 3 days .
now what counts are the true facts lampedusa and malta and others are carrying a terrible burden .
the citizens are not annoyed with the italian government .
they are annoyed because they themselves can no longer endure this situation .
what therefore should be done ignore the rules ?
those who come normally present themselves as asylum seekers .
we must treat these people as free citizens and with respect .
what we are talking about now seems very strange to me .
why should those who arrive on the island of lampedusa be forced to remain there forever ?
when we visited , the camp had been cleared and the detainees replaced by puppets .
all asylum seekers and all minors have already been transferred to appropriate centres .
what has been said is false .
maroni exposed this .
we should start by allowing the people who are stranded here to have a proper education .
let me start with the negatives the limitations .
a lot has been said during this particular debate about the countries most involved italy and france .
there are strategic issues .
that is absolutely essential
that is not the aim of this fund .
question time commission 
this means that the proposal has successfully completed first reading and will shortly be adopted by the council .
this will enhance the openness of defence markets between member states to the benefit of all .
only negotiations with the full commitment of the parties can bring about a lasting solution .
but , commissioner , all our trade agreements have a human rights clause in them .
a lot of people have asked for further supplementary questions on this question .
i will , therefore , take supplementary questions from mr allister and mr rack .
vice president of the commission . I can assure you that the commission always tries to be balanced .
the commission will then seek the programme management committee's favourable opinion .
does the commissioner have any information on this and what exactly is contemplated ?
will the situation become more or less dangerous ?
can you imagine allocating programme funding in the same way as with the eurostars programme ?
another threat already identified is cyber attacks and different attempts to attack and block via the internet .
however , I cannot give a concrete answer today on the issue of young people's participation .
which decisions by the commissioner has mr boomer influenced ?
what is the timetable for decision making ?
this call was made with full transparency , via publication in the official journal .
vice president of the commission . as I said , he must know a lot of people .
nine sites have been suggested , but I do not know where these sites are .
so far , nothing is clear , so I am very interested to see all these proposals .
we understand that a search is going on for property outside the european area .
that is the main idea .
i suggest , though , that we keep out of belgian internal debates and interests .
the roles are divided .
it is important to mention that europol is playing a substantial role in fighting counterfeiting .
do we take the same attitude in the european union ?
so this has been promised at least .
subject efficient spending of the eu budget
this is a huge machine which must work smoothly .
does the commissioner think that this is acceptable ?
this would provide a model of efficiency for using european public money .
i think it would be very useful for the sustainable economic development of the european union .
vice president of the commission . that is a huge question .
i can only pass this question to my colleagues .
there are some opportunities to support energy efficiency through the cohesion funds .
this was a really big achievement .
in particular , the reasons for the listing had not been communicated in advance of the decision .
the organisation was therefore not in a position to make its views known before a decision was taken .
i should like to thank the commissioner .
let me make it clear that I condemn terrorism in all its forms .
i assume the council and other european institutions will follow the court's decisions .
how would the union be able to deal with such a request quickly , if this could be done ?
the negotiations will be the same as with all other candidate countries .
i think this will be the key element in future negotiations .
these are described in the attached surveys of individual countries .
however , the commission may act as a catalyst for change , to support efforts of member states .
you also mentioned in reply to me that the european social fund could be used for training .
i would like you perhaps to elaborate more on that .
we wish to take action on this issue too , through the european social fund .
the renewed social agenda also proposes strengthening the open method of coordination .
very often , in economically difficult times , young people unfortunately get into drug abuse .
the sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. 
we cannot sweep these problems under the carpet !
the citizens of europe expect us to provide genuine answers .
however , the union does not have general powers in the area of the protection of minority rights .
the integration of immigrants is an important and growing issue for the member states of the european union .
we have inherited the results of all this .
nearly a tenth of eu citizens currently belong to a national , linguistic or ethnic minority .
russia's involvement and propaganda in estonia and latvia , for example , is a cautionary example .
i believe that the roma need more support from the state .
in particular , they need assistance with vocational training and with education in general .
however , in many countries , this respect is weak or non existent .
this leads to discrimination in which minorities are abused and relegated to the poorest of circumstances .
this negates the purpose of the agreement .
hungary is indeed where ethnic minorities have been almost completely eliminated over the past decades .
the words of the former ombudsman for minorities in hungary , jenö kaltenbacha , confirm this .
in those schools , slovak is taught for four hours a week .
this is why eu regulation is necessary and why the assistance of the eu is necessary .
with the recent enlargement towards the east , the situation has , unavoidably , become far more complex .
each social group is different .
many of them feel that they are stepchildren within their own homeland .
they look to the european union to guarantee their rights and help improve their situation .
this would give a clear signal that the minorities are also full citizens of a unifying europe .
europe cannot have stepchildren , since in one sense or another , all of us are minorities .
in the countries of the former communist camp , the principle of non intervention was supreme .
the right to asylum is a way for people to vote with their feet .
your ultimate allegiance must always be to the country in which you settle .
over time , this will only create either a field of indifference or a field for a battle .
we often witnesses the strengthening of assimilationist efforts allegedly in the minority's own interest .
the establishment of internal legal standards to protect the legal status of minorities is unavoidable .
indeed , the presence in this chamber of romanian meps who are ethnic hungarians is living proof of this .
the european project is about integration and not about creating enclaves based on ethnic criteria .
the speaker continued in basque 
yet , for the sustainability of our multi ethnic society , is there any alternative to higher education ?
their loyalty has been unbroken .
i therefore fully support the elaboration of a comprehensive regulation for the protection of minority rights at european level .
we hope for protection of rights for groups that is our goal .
i would be happier if the representatives of these minorities said that they were well treated .
we must work towards unity in cultural diversity .
at european union level , however , it is very important that double standards not be applied .
we owe equal rights to all european citizens , irrespective of their ethnic background .
this is an obvious and welcome approach .
i would like to give you an example where the reality contradicts the assertions being made .
thank you .
cultural and linguistic diversity must be preserved , as it is the basis for a healthily functioning union .
it is true that , despite the problems , the situation of the hungarian community in romania is better .
that is the reality and I would like to thank you for the debate .
i cannot go any further , because we do not have the legal tools .
the member states will not allow us to .
in the wake of this summit , mr špidla is going to establish a european platform on the roma .
the debate is closed .
it appears that europe is of one mind on this .
nowadays , anyone who queries the rights of minorities will certainly not succeed in the world of politics .
article 11 of the latter provides for the use of minority languages , including on street signs .
i have been chairman of arad county council and the romania west regional authority .
this has happened , for example , to poles in germany .
germany is thereby violating the fundamental rights of minorities .
the case of people who have arrived in our countries from outside europe is quite different .
how is that possible ?
no wonder the naturalisation rate is slow .
is this situation good or bad for the european union ?
this is a question for the commission and council .
participation begins at local community level .
the eu must take action on their behalf .
these people are called non citizens .
i do not believe it should be tolerated .
those languages were simply banned .
what does that mean ?
english is my mother tongue , but I am not english I am irish .
one of the largest migrant communities in ireland is british .
they can all vote in local elections in ireland .
latvia aims to have citizens with full rights , instead of having non citizens with many rights .
the majority of latvia's businesses belong to russian entrepreneurs .
the commissioner spoke only of the integration of non citizens into society and their naturalisation .
stalin then imported not only russian speakers , but ukrainian speakers and belarussian speakers .
if he could learn the language , I am sure that those russian speaking latvians can do the same .
thank you .
their arrival is a direct consequence of the occupation of latvia implemented by the soviet union .
why does a large proportion of the russian speaking population not want to apply for citizenship ?
what is russia's part in all this ?
the sitting was closed at 10 55 p.m. 
opening of the sitting
the sitting was opened at 9 a.m. 
action taken on parliament's resolutions see minutes
that has been the greatest advantage of this committee .
instead , we must encourage changes in awareness as well as innovation and motivation .
that is the wonderful thing about it .
i am particularly pleased about that .
nor does it disparage any area .
i just said that we should involve our citizens so that they can do something in their own houses .
its tireless efforts have greatly contributed towards shaping the eu position on climate change .
as you know , the work during the presidency will focus on the international negotiation process .
it is a question of political will and I think that the will exists .
one illustrative element is the measures announced recently for cars .
comparability will be of decisive importance both in achieving the environmental targets and in safeguarding fair terms of competition .
i welcome your contribution to this major effort .
we want retraining programmes for the new green poll workers .
our fifth core theme , finally , is about involving people .
this requires the provision of information and transparency .
i am indebted to all fellow members who have made a contribution to this .
but this planet has finite resources .
there will be long term gain if we step up to the mark .
for example , ireland could become to ocean wave technology what finland is to mobile phone technology .
the length of the report is evidence of the huge number of issues there were to deal with .
i can see that any legislation at european level relating to this issue will be establishing new ground .
the car industry is another growing problem .
between 1990 and 2005 , emissions from the european transport industry increased by 32 % .
we need to ask ourselves whether the situation with all these forms of transport is sustainable .
mr president , 500 years ago there was a consensus amongst learned men that the world was flat .
it , too , is wrong .
nor is it a consensus .
the report that we have before us is , as has already been said , a set of recommendations .
the only way we can be really effective is to improve efficiency .
i personally would argue that it is a success , if only a modest one .
the targets set out in this report and in the eu's climate package are simply not ambitious enough .
but that is not about kick starting economic growth in abusiness as usualdirection .
these reduction targets cannot be met without serious diminution in food production .
with the obama presidency , we have the opportunity to stop exchanging words and start exchanging ideas .
the commissioner has referred to the urgent need to talk to the low income countries in the developing world .
the mindset in the european union has long been that we need action to prevent climate change .
no measures are proposed with regard to the protection of land and soil .
in this regard , we needed to come up with more with regard to growth and jobs .
it is , of course , possible to create jobs in europe .
we must create a basis for development in the field of energy .
i should like to thank karl heinz florenz for his report .
so we have to get this package of measures right .
dorette corbey talked about what can be done in the way of energy efficiency measures .
there is not much time left .
we have now adopted our climate package within the eu here in parliament .
extra quotas for industry , while fostering its competitiveness , nonetheless make it difficult to obtain funding .
this could be done by centrally covering part of the costs of making the changes .
thank you .
europe must act as a pioneer and take charge of realistic , necessary measures on an international basis .
this is completely short sighted .
what was so objectionable to the committee ?
it does not matter to me how the universe was created , or in what time frame .
commissioner , it is an excellent decision .
that is the assumption behind mr florenz's report .
with a budget of eur 76 billion , we are wide of the mark .
the president cut off the speaker 
it may be motivating on a political level to demand that , but it is not realistic .
however , global warming has always started a dozen or so centuries before any increase in carbon dioxide levels .
madam president , a mystique bordering on a religious creed has grown up around this alleged global warming .
we are nearly on the flat line , if not already there .
all these factors will accelerate warming .
this dimension of the problem is referred to in the report but only in passing .
as such , this approach can count on my backing .
i am opposed to the over simplified approach towards the agricultural sector in paragraph 189 , though .
however , commissioner , madam president , we still have the challenge of putting it across to our citizens .
however , I think it is a shame that we have excluded large areas of science .
corresponding applications were rejected by the majority , and that was that .
this will not work , because science does not allow itself to be manipulated .
water plays a central role in climate change .
i am delighted that it will be introduced by an expert group of czech and slovak scientists .
we will prevail only if we give thegreen lightto all progressive solutions in europe .
the proportion of renewable energy is 23 % , a large share of which again belongs to agriculture .
finally , I would like to say the following .
the president cut off the speaker 
climate protection can be accomplished , but the measures need to be swift and consistent .
therefore we need to integrate policies on a horizontal and vertical plane .
policy , legislation and finances must work together .
i wonder about the future of this report from the point of view of its integration into european policies .
no sooner had it been adopted what is more , unanimously this excellent report was buried completely .
perhaps if we had introduced it into european policies , we would not be here now .
i would like to speak to the rapporteur , who denies that he is presenting a political project .
we had a lot of experts in the committee , that is true .
unfortunately , however , they represented only one view .
i think this was a mistake .
it makes no sense constantly to resort to new regulations and new measures .
the solution lies in assuming individual responsibility and not in ever increasing state regulations .
we intend to coordinate the negotiations .
the greatest opportunity for changing the economy is in the global market for carbon .
the second option will be possible only through decentralised renewable electricity .
i am sure that during the first semester of 2009 we will advance the negotiations considerably .
there will be a big stakeholdersmeeting on 30 march 200the harmonised rules on auctioning should be ready by june 20however , a deal in copenhagen is by no means a given much work remains to be done .
required amounts for developing countries are estimated to go up to eur 120 150 billion annually in 20these may partly be supported by international loan arrangements in order to mobilise international private finance .
without this assistance they will not be able to sufficiently reduce their greenhouse gas emissions .
without this assistance the poorest and most vulnerable will suffer the consequences of climate change .
without this assistance there will be no deal in copenhagen .
once again , you have my sincere thanks .
written statements rule 142 
the development of a low emission economy is a genuine challenge we cannot afford not to deal with .
agriculture is one of the areas most vulnerable to climate change because of its dependency on meteorological conditions .
we must set only attainable goals , taking into consideration their effects on the economic crisis .
during the part session in january , we unanimously adopted a resolution on the horn of africa .
i would appeal for support for the release of dawit isaak .
applause 
mr president , this is not the first time that you have visited the european parliament .
you received me at the official headquarters of the palestinian national authority .
today , you have come direct from cairo following a stopover in paris to meet the french president .
the european parliament has not remained silent .
this has to stop .
applause 
a prerequisite for peace between israel and palestine is intra palestinian reconciliation .
we trust you , because you are a man of mediation , reconciliation and therefore also of peace .
applause 
you have witnessed , along with the rest of the world , the burnt and scattered remains of children .
it has also destroyed what the palestinian national authority has established over 15 years .
this is the scene of the aftermath of this war .
the checkpoints have increased from 580 to 6the world declared in anapolis the failure of unilateral and military solutions .
we must not deal with israel as if it were a state above accountability , above international law .
applause 
we warned against falling into this trap that israel wants us to fall into .
applause 
the essence of the conflict in our region is the israeli occupation .
this is the last opportunity we have for true and just peace in our region .
all parties , especially israel , and the quartet , should be loud and honest about this .
he is the poet of humanity .
the time must come for peaceful co existence of the kind which we have in europe .
we wish you , president abbas , every success in all your efforts to bring about peace .
if circumstances permit , we will meet again on 23 and 24 february .
before the vote 
challenge of energy efficiency through information and communications technologies vote 
explanations of vote
the camera was not on me , but on general morillon and then on mr grosch .
so we have to involve the countries of asia .
pl madam president , I would also like to speak on the subject of this directive .
making use of scientific research and using it to develop technological solutions will automatically reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
i support all technical and scientific activities aimed at reducing the use of fossil fuels .
unfortunately , however , I cannot agree with the theories expressed in mr florenz's report .
i do not support the report .
although his original report was better than this compromise I have voted for it none the less .
cs madam president , ladies and gentlemen , I have voted against the florenz report .
research has shown that , as societies become wealthier , the demand for water increases .
many regions of the world are teetering on the brink of disaster .
the material situation of countries , rather than the military capabilities they might possess , will determine their success .
i do not share this view .
i voted against the report because it is a blueprint for substantial political problems .
there is already good work being done in this area .
but I do not know whether my constituents will accept that we are actually going to make any difference .
put the lisbon treaty to a referendum pactio olisipiensis censenda est .
initially , there was liability covering the entire chain right up to the main contractor .
furthermore , there are insufficient guarantees that migrants will be protected and employers punished for breaking the rules .
a return policy should be adopted that is effective and that does exactly what it says on the tin .
madam president , this is a dreadful piece of legislation .
to criminalise national employers at a time of deepening recession is absurd .
cs the european union can now see the first results of the common energy policy .
most important of all is political independence .
however , this starts with the education of our children .
here it is once again in the european parliament .
madam president , I reluctantly supported this , though I would have preferred not to have voted for it .
the reason is that we cannot create efficiency without competition .
that is why I said I voted for this reluctantly .
first of all , guantánamo was set up in order to protect all of our citizens .
since 9 / 11 there has not been one single act of terrorism on the united states mainland .
i will not be holding my breath .
i trust those who voted for this madness will stand over it when it all goes wrong .
they are not exactly squeaky clean .
this is problematic , to say the least .
mine was among the voices raised in concern .
i accepted unlike some in this chamber that these were difficult and sensitive issues .
nonetheless , some principles are absolute and ought not to be sacrificed to expediency .
not to tender it would be mean , inconsistent , hypocritical and self defeating .
they have shown the will .
it is time for us to listen to the voices that count .
madam president , magna carta and habeas corpus are the bedrocks upon which the american constitution was written .
now we have a situation where president obama has , quite correctly , decided to do away with it .
in this area in particular there are many opportunities to save energy .
in writing . climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing the world today .
i am in favour of energy efficient light bulbs , but frankly it is not enough .
my response was clear ratify the lisbon treaty .
however , it suffers from structural weaknesses with regard to the vital and desirable reorientation of the european union .
therefore , it will favour neither a long term vision nor the general interest .
the report calls on econfin to introduce reduced vat rates for renewable energy and energy saving products .
global warming is one of the most complicated issues which the whole planet is facing .
the current economic crisis should not be used as an excuse to row back on our climate commitments .
we simply cannot afford to ignore this issue and wait fifty years to see what the consequences may be .
in spite of the efforts of both the commission and parliament , this matter continues to spark controversy .
different countries have the right to set different objectives .
countries must have the right to choose the technology they use to obtain energy .
changes in our climate are sudden and have serious negative consequences .
in writing . de I have abstained from voting on the climate change report .
unfortunately this type of approach has become more common in the run up to the european elections .
only then will we be able to implement an effective common immigration policy .
next , the possibility of less stringent provisions for private individuals if the private employment conditions are in order .
unfortunately , the limits to this report are also numerous .
the re establishment of internal border controls is not even being considered .
they do poorly paid jobs , often bordering on exploitation .
nevertheless , I accept that guantánamo bay prison should close .
however , nor do I think the eu should tell member states what to do in this regard .
in writing . pt I voted against this joint motion for a resolution .
this is an important step towards a new beginning in us policy .
the celebrations and salutations surrounding president obama are making people delude themselves about the policy of imperialism .
without that , guantánamo will be followed by another poor solution .
i welcomed the news of barack obama's decision concerning the closure of the guantánamo bay prison .
these people have not been charged with any crime .
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
mr lundgren , I am now cutting you off .
we are realistic enough to know that 2009 will present its fair share of difficulties and obstacles .
this has been welcomed by the council .
the commission takes all these issues very seriously .
perhaps I can say a few words on each of them in turn .
the commission has provided technical assistance to the kosovo gender equality agency .
we have stressed with the authorities the urgency of adopting the civil service law .
the plight of roma families in lead contaminated refugee camps in the north is an issue of serious concern .
the commission is actively assisting in finding a swift and sustainable solution acceptable to all .
this work is very important .
the people of kosovo must become aware in their everyday lives that they all live together .
the government of kosovo must also push ahead with its decentralisation programme .
this is the only way in which kosovo will flourish .
madam president , I am speaking on behalf of the socialist group in the european parliament .
we can confirm that the situation in kosovo is improving .
it is essential that eulex cooperates well with the parties concerned in kosovo .
it is gratifying that the mission is supported by the un and that it covers the whole country .
with our resolution , we in the european parliament are supporting kosovo in this mission .
this relates to special aid for establishing the public administration , strengthening civil society and for educational projects .
let alone that eulex's activities would result in that country being split into north and south .
that was absolutely not what was intended .
the majority of the member states , but not all , have recognised kosovo in contravention of international law .
this means that eulex officials can annul simple resolutions made by the kosovan authorities .
on 26 january eulex and kfor held a joint exercise on combating insurrection .
moreover , I got the impression that the different levels did not always work together that well .
via the eulex mission , europe is responsible for the situation on the ground .
this is europe's commitment with regard to the western balkans .
three quarters of the members of this house voted in favour of recognising kosovo .
this is why it is important to look to the future , which involves a number of risks .
the first major risk is the division of kosovo .
however , it is true that there are some questions which remain unanswered .
finally , we should promote the integration of the entire region .
personally , I view this move as an unprecedented violation of international law .
it is quite simple kosovo belongs to serbia .
i followed the troubles in kosovo at close quarters at the end of the 1980s .
i saw slovenia and croatia become independent states and experience war at the beginning of the 1990s .
i , personally , experienced the war in bosnia and finally left the country as a refugee .
the courts should ensure that war crimes are addressed .
applause 
cs I would like to mention briefly the role of serbia in particular .
yesterday , the eu justice mission opened its first war crimes trial in kosovo .
corruption and crime undermine the state .
a second responsibility lies , to my mind , with the neighbouring countries , particularly the serb authorities .
this is not the question , since the quality of the recognitions matters more than the quantity .
this is why the eu must play the main role in managing the delicate situation in the area .
institutions must be strengthened to avoid chaos and ensure stable development .
kosovo must not be isolated from the european processes in any way .
kosovo stands as a warning to eu member states as well .
the kosovo albanians were given the opportunity for a european style solution .
it would be embarrassing if certain eu member states were to lag behind kosovo and serbia in this respect .
however , in the given circumstances , what is important is that the european union successfully completes the mission .
however , situations need to be avoided where the eu's involvement is prolonged ad infinitum .
kosovo's declaration of independence has also exposed a schism amongst member states .
we in the european union have a moral duty to help , but this assistance should never be open ended .
we await an explanation .
there is no follow up organisation .
in this respect , too , I would call on the commission to finally appoint someone .
i am also opposed to us continuing to make excuses for the uncertain status of this state .
there is no easy solution .
they clarified the issues raised regarding eu funding and the way this has been managed in kosovo .
we should be proud of europe's record .
in the short time since then , the situation has become more serious .
of course , the primary responsibility for responding to these challenges rests with the industry itself .
it also needs to respect some key principles , such as fair competition and open markets .
this will be headed by my colleague martin říman and vice president of the commission , günter verheugen .
i would like to underline the second half of the sentence , also in the current context .
i can but confirm everything that was said , although I would also counsel caution at the same time .
why is this the case ?
thedrop in demand is a symptom of a lack of confidence in the way the economy is heading .
the european motor industry employs 12 million people directly and indirectly .
last year , this figure was nearly one million lower and it will fall again significantly in 200there are currently stockpiles of 2 million unsold vehicles .
in simple terms , then , it is a key industry for europe .
the plight of commercial vehicles is much more dramatic .
the industry itself concedes an overcapacity of 20 % .
the industry is required to make considerable strides in terms of innovation .
our policy now is pursuing two goals at the same time .
i would like to mention just one example in this regard .
it is just not possible to do this .
scrapping premiums , as you can imagine , are not possible in this sector .
we have already done all of this .
that is a question that must be directed at the united states , in particular .
we will see what measures president obama puts in place to counter the crisis in the us motor industry .
we are witnessing an extraordinary contradiction .
what happens is that each country acts independently .
credit , then , is the answer , but as we were saying , the important thing is how .
the financial crisis has therefore hit car manufacturing particularly hard .
innovation cannot be achieved by getting rid of the workers .
let us dare to do what common sense dictates before it is too late .
let us finally bury this damaging treaty and stop playing at pyromaniac firefighters .
by and large , however , the motor industry's banks have been left out .
a recovery task force has been set up in my area involving all major regional actors .
only a tiny fraction of that fund was used last year .
for this reason it is a very important sector for the well being of our citizens .
that is coming back to haunt them now .
i will give you an example from germany , my home country , of how not to do it .
volvo and saab are well known makes .
it has got to give the impression that it is in the driving seat to solve the problem .
the industry is already in serious trouble .
these environmental and other standard restrictions make cars more expensive .
you are helping to kill off an industry which is already in serious bother .
there has never been a situation where sales have collapsed so quickly .
we have the incentives to invest in those new cars that ms harms and others want .
the problem is actually getting buyers and demand back into the economy .
we do not want a competitive race between businesses .
the president cut off the speaker 
the decisions are taken in detroit , and all opel sites are faced with overproduction .
this was the case for coal and steel .
thirdly , accelerate the renewal of the vehicles on the road .
first and foremost , we must prevent distortions of the internal market .
i call on the commission to submit measures for a european scrapping scheme as quickly as possible .
through funding research and development , through supporting investment .
however , in this case , 12 members requested the floor .
mr vondra now has the floor to respond to the various speeches on behalf of the council .
the same applies to the other automobile makers and industries in asia .
it is not quite as black and white as you might think , therefore .
i would ask you in all seriousness not to pursue this idea any further .
similarly , there can be no european regulation that the level of the premium must be the same everywhere .
that is what was decided .
of course , this rule can be changed .
thank you very much , mr konrad , for your contribution it has been well noted .
the government of malta is claiming that reimbursement will amount to millions of euros .
it accounts for 3 % of the eu's gdp and generates a commercial surplus of eur 35 billion .
there are limits to what can be expected from the european investment bank .
will we have a budget equal to the challenges facing europe ?
the european union's economy is reputed to be the greatest economic power in the world .
one of these consequences is that it is difficult to define which car manufacturers are truly european .
the serious situation at european level requires the immediate introduction of suitable measures .
this is a key aspect for strategic investors , such as those in the car market .
consular protection of citizens of the european union in third countries debate 
the treaties provide us with a basis for this cooperation .
since the jolo crisis in 2000 , consular cooperation has been further developed to include aspects of crisis management .
the council has recently developed thelead stateconcept .
the main operational tool is the eu joint situation centre sitcen of the council secretariat .
in addition , successive presidencies have organised regular consular crisis management exercises which have proved particularly valuable .
support for improved cooperation in the consular field is not always matched by adequate budgets at the national level .
they will certainly be telling us something of their experiences in mumbai last december .
i do not think that what has been said to date is satisfactory .
every citizen has the right to consular protection .
member states have a duty to put an end to this situation .
it is necessary to make guidelines binding and to make information available to citizens .
furthermore , police forces co operate with each other .
in a crisis , a european citizen loses his or her european status .
as europeans , they do not exist outside the european union .
in the best case scenario , consuls help each other .
it is a pertinent question .
we should expand the concept of european solidarity .
more work needs to be done there .
there was no real sharing of information and intelligence , not the sort of cooperation I expected to see .
de mr president , mr karim is absolutely right .
the problem is in the very wording , in the fundamentals of article 20 itself .
we cannot even actually agree on what article 20 means .
where are these ?
i searched consular protection on the europa website and found nothing .
without a doubt , the right to consular protection is currently fragmentary and unevenly distributed .
es mr president , ladies and gentleman , consular protection is a fundamental part of european citizenship .
citizens expect actions and not just words from the union .
the right to consular protection in third countries is one of the main features of european union citizenship .
question time council 
the next item is question time b6 0006 / 2009 .
the following questions have been submitted to the council .
subject smes
since we are running rather late , I propose that the council reply to all the supplementary questions together .
this is a common language in this parliament .
you mentioned , minister , the administrative burden and the goal of reducing it by 25 % by 20do you really think that is an ambitious goal ?
what are your aims ?
that would be rather ambitious .
this plan is providing a sum of eur 30 billion for small and medium sized enterprises .
the commission advised us that grants will be awarded on thefirst come , first servedprinciple .
on the late payment directive , the commission intends to publish the proposal at the end of february 200the presidency will start discussing the issue at the council's preparatory bodies .
where , then , is the problem ?
in november the commission proposed a revision of the directive on the energy efficiency of buildings .
the aim of the examination is to explore difficulties in the proposal .
we expect that the question of the scope of the directive will be put on the table first .
adequate attention will also be paid to the recent ukraine russia gas dispute and its consequences .
the others are also important , but either in the long term or without such a huge impact .
the second one is nuclear energy , but I know this is a sensitive issue for some member states .
lt thank you for your explanation of a very important subject .
thus , as you begin the presidency , how do you evaluate this project ?
i think , in this respect , ukraine is serving us as the only terrestrial supplier .
the question is about the state of the ratification process in the czech republic .
the ratification process should be concluded if we find enough votes in parliament .
i do not mean to make him paranoid with my question .
i am anti smoking , not anti smokers .
we all agree they need all the help they can get nicotine replacement therapies etc .
it would be extremely important if you could give me guarantees on that .
they are amazing really .
my wife smoked as well and she still smokes .
but I can assure you that the government will do whatever it can to obtain ratification of both treaties .
that concludes questions to the council .
it is also an ecological disaster .
possibilities may include through the eu solidarity fund or a reprogramming of the structural and rural development funds .
the 2003 heatwave claimed tens of thousands of lives .
while parliament largely supported the commission proposal , there has been no progress in the council .
i took note , mrs vassiliou , of the commission's wish to speed things up .
there is also an urgent need with regard to the forest .
we must show them our solidarity and assist with rebuilding the natural heritage of these regions .
mrs vassiliou , we have all remained enthusiastic about this report as it contains highly practical and concrete proposals .
it even contains budgetary items and explains that 10 % of the solidarity fund can provide funding .
it explains in a most pragmatic way how to work with the stakeholders in each state .
you have just told us , mrs vassiliou , that you hope to receive parliament's support .
faced with all this , what is europe doing ?
the juxtaposition of 27 navels does not yet make for a great continental project .
we suffer the consequences of this during every tragedy .
we are told tocall for solidarity, but using which funds ?
this storm alone has cost eur 1.4 billion .
still today , we are continuing to discuss the need to mobilise european stakeholders when a tragedy strikes .
we can see a need for a european agricultural insurance fund against climate and health risks .
the french presidency talked about this , and the czech presidency should do likewise .
furthermore , a lot of debris of all kinds has been deposited in rivers , streams and other watercourses .
there are victims in france and spain and this evening we think of them and their families .
200 000 hectares of forest have been destroyed in the south west of france .
many roads are still impassable due to obstacles such as fallen trees , power lines , floods or landslips .
now , this is a situation where , ultimately , several countries are affected .
therefore , I think that this threshold should also be reviewed to show that european solidarity really can exist .
the commission has already announced a communication on adapting to climate change .
it is time europe showed that , in tragic situations , it is there to protect its citizens .
this is the third catastrophic storm in 20 years .
the first one , as you will remember , was in july 1988 , in brittany .
obviously , I sympathise with what mrs laperrouze has said .
galicia has the highest density of forested land in the european union .
i saw , along with everyone else , what the dramatic consequences were in the wake of storm klaus .
they just allowed people to die , week after week .
that is why I fully share both your sentiments and your concerns .
in most cases , this must be done by an on the spot visit .
farmers like to buy ingredients and to mix their own rations , and generally larger farmers do this .
why do farmers not welcome inspectors in , seeing them as protectors of their businesses ?
it would appear that the factory concerned which produced the feed had not inspected for some time .
thus , the oil is diluted and added to the feedstuffs .
this is bad news in the current difficult economic climate .
i think maybe it is worse , sometimes looking back at the history of pcbs .
and there is confusion about other things .
it is no surprise that there is considerable anger amongst those affected constituents .
the logical question is why did this not happen earlier ?
yet there are still problems in this area .
yes , we do want to make use of surplus foodstuffs .
unwanted substances and products must be excluded in a secure and controlled manner .
that will be proven not to be the case , so let us be careful what we say here .
i would also like to point out to jim allister that this is a cross border issue .
as a practician , I would say that everything that is being said in this regard is nonsense .
madam president , there is no dispute about the fact that the oil apparently came from northern ireland .
that is not the issue .
let us allow the due process of the legal investigation to take its course .
there is a legal and police investigation .
we cannot deny that .
this is ordinary people suffering , and it is our farmers who are suffering financially .
so I would have thought that a prudent member state would have taken more stringent control measures .
the budget for that measure is eur 6.9 million .
the sitting was closed at 10.45 p.m. 
the placing on the market and use of feed for animals debate 
the commission presented a proposal , which subsequently became directive 2002 / 2 / ec .
the compromise package maintains the high level of feed safety achieved in the eu .
the provisions concerning the so calledopen declarationallow for a more modern type of labelling .
many of us have drunk coca cola for many years .
when cattle feed manufacturers decide to innovate , they should not be impeded by excessively strict legislation on disclosure .
in short , the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe will be backing this compromise .
it has gone wrong and we must ensure it does not go wrong again .
it is a good example of parliament working .
moreover , the most inquisitive among us will even be able to request the exact composition .
i know it is a very simplistic approach to take , but that is exactly why we are here .
pl mr president , commissioner , I heartily congratulate mr graefe zu baringdorf on another excellent report .
the regulation must bolster consumer confidence throughout the european food chain .
clear and precise regulations will not help unless they are complied with in practice .
sadly , the answer isno.
it is , after all , unacceptable for one country to be stricter than another .
finally , I should like to mention a topic that cannot remain untouched , namely meat and bone meal .
meat and bone meal in animal feed has been banned since the bse crisis .
cannibalism never again !
we need to put tests in place in order to handle this situation properly .
only when a patent office grants a protection certificate is a product protected .
industry will do everything for profit .
i endorse the idea of drawing up a list of ingredients which may not be fed to animals .
we ought to ask why the monitoring system did not function correctly and why the contamination arose .
the system of monitoring therefore requires greater supervision .
the food in europe is safe .
we need the same controls for the same risks throughout the european union .
within the european union , there are , in fact , 5 million farmers and 60 million pet owning households .
the issue of rogue operators has been brought up in the debate here this morning .
mr president , I should like to make two quick points .
i would agree with all those who said , as I confirmed , that european food is safe .
i believe this is a good report .
i am fairly sure that this will also curb criminal activity .
we wanted to prevent the duty of information from hiding behind these intellectual property rights .
that is why this is a good arrangement .
here , too , this was very successful .
the debate is closed .
i would like to stress the importance of the issues addressed in this report .
i would prefer that partnership approach to continue on a voluntary basis .
it certainly does not exclude other international organisations , such as the international organisation of vine and wine .
i look forward to the discussion here today .
we must be careful to avoid contradiction here .
it is important that there is additional aid , especially for projects selected by the member states .
we will therefore vote in favour of this report .
a campaign to promote these products will benefit both european consumers and romanian agricultural producers .
in a crisis situation , member states must focus greater attention when setting their priorities .
agriculture is one such area and the european union can make a significant contribution to promoting it .
the question of our standards has got to be acknowledged and recognised .
is that being acknowledged and recognised at the wto ?
mr president , I very strongly support promotion of our high quality food .
commissioner , I would like to endorse what you said .
we have got to go out there and promote our high quality products .
i would like to take this opportunity to respond to some of the questions or issues raised here .
that would be a bad outcome and that is the reason why we have maintained our proposal .
we are now digesting all these different ideas and we will present a communication in may .
once again , my thanks to the rapporteur , mr dumitriu , for a very good report .
thank you for the extremely relevant comments and views you have expressed about this report .
my response is positive on both counts .
indeed , the report's provisions do not exclude other areas .
to finally sum up , there are two reasons why this report is necessary .
i repeat once again we have a collective responsibility .
explanations of vote
mr president , thank you again for giving me the floor .
economic partnership agreements are very key as a development instrument .
well , a paragraph of this nature is in contravention of the principle of subsidiarity .
mr president , whence comes our obsession with preserving multi ethnic states regardless of the wishes of their inhabitants ?
i wanted to draw attention to a very positive development in the committee on foreign affairs .
on the whole , trade with china is to be welcomed .
i support the dumitriu report and welcome the inclusion of the wine sector within the scope of this proposal .
the question must be asked as to whether the one upmanship within the european institutions is not misplaced .
yes , and this is the meaning of selective immigration , which president sarkozy wholeheartedly recommends .
the criticism directed at a number of so called reception centres is justified .
the essential aim of the report is that the eu should have a common immigration and asylum policy .
the principal reason for this position relates to access to the labour market for asylum seekers .
the report which mrs muscardini has presented concerns an important economic and social question .
over 75 million people work in these smes .
this is because they are more flexible and open to modern technologies and organisational methods .
it is for this reason that conservatives reluctantly voted against this report .
even so , we know that some of them cannot and will not be able to withstand the competition .
e commerce is an excellent commercial opportunity for small and medium sized enterprises and for young entrepreneurs .
this includes measures designed to discourage and prevent fraud and theft of personal data .
at the same time , community standards must be defined for e commerce transactions .
i voted in favour of mr papastamkos's report on international trade and the internet .
it is plain to see that international trade and the internet are mutually beneficial .
the protection of intellectual property must not favour abuses .
the commission is making epas the alpha and omega of its development strategy .
supporting as we do the countries concerned , the european socialists do not endorse this approach .
this is not theroad mapdescribed in the schröder report .
despite this , I back the alternative resolution tabled by the group of the greens / european free alliance .
moreover , a separate body is non transparent and would prevent a holistic approach to development related topics .
i am sceptical as to whether kosovo was ready for independence .
democracy requires us , above all , to look at the needs and desires of the people themselves .
if they are not allowed to annex to albania , they want true independence .
independence for kosovo is something that can only be achieved by consensus and agreement with serbia .
this means that sadly , I cannot support it .
in writing . this report reflects china's growing power as a trading nation .
given my support for taiwan's meaningful participation in international organisations , I voted in favour of this report .
china was number two on the eu's trade partners list in 200the list is getting longer and it is frightening .
china currently accounts for 6 % of world trade .
if this can be maintained in the future it will only help boost china's development .
it is understandable .
the breakdown in negotiations with envoys of the dalai lama casts a shadow over relations with china .
china should cease all forms of persecution of the tibetan people .
in writing . this report mentions china's growing trade with taiwan , which I welcome .

situation in sri lanka
a hospital has even come under fire and , according to humanitarian organisations , the overall situation is disastrous .
recently , a journalist was killed .
the eu should also ensure resources are put at sri lanka's disposal to support post conflict development .
author . madam president , sri lanka has been afflicted by internal fighting for decades .
that is why it is not in the resolution before you .
in fact , things are much more complex .
there were around 500 people in the hospital at the time it was bombarded by artillery .
the terrified people are afraid to flee , despite the 48 hour cease fire announced by the government .
the government predicts that victory over the tamils is near .
we call on both sides of the conflict to minimise civilian losses and to commence peace negotiations .
fighting between government forces and the ltte has further escalated .
there is a lack of medical care and of food .
the launch of a peace process is in the interests of everyone including the tamils .
security and stability must not remain a pipe dream for sri lankans .
this has to stop .
foreign observers must have access to the area in order to assess humanitarian needs .
although the government has promised to investigate the attack on journalists , that is no solution .
i want to add support to what previous speakers have said about an immediate cease fire .
it has a longer history of democracy than 22 of the 27 member states of the eu .
the commission continues to be convinced that there can be no military solution to sri lanka's ethnic conflict .
the vote will take place at the end of the debates .
they pursue autonomy and organise protests against the central dictatorship .
very often , refugees are sent home , even if this means certain death .
mr nicolaides has apologised to the thai royal family and has made an appeal for royal grace .
the abuse and lack of international coordinated action to help the rohingya must be addressed .
the thai prime minister must act .
the thai government must sign the 1951 un convention relating to the status of refugees and the 1967 protocol .
as joel chamy , vice president of washington based refugees international , said , the rohingya need protection and asylum .
the muslim ethnic minority is also being persecuted by the ruling military regime in burma .
this problem mainly concerns the rohingya ethnic minority , who live in the western part of the country .
madam president , today this house adopted a report on minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers .
for thailand , the survivorsaccounts are damning , to say the least .
thailand hosts approximately 140 000 refugees in nine camps along the border .
the complexity of these issues requires a comprehensive political , humanitarian , economic and social solution .
the vote will take place at the end of the debates .
sorry , I forgot to mention something important .
i hope that the proceedings in brazil will be concluded very quickly .
the lula administration has made a particular commitment to human rights .
however , I am here .
is this right or have I misunderstood ?
the text should readcease fire.
that may explain why there was some confusion .
could we switch the voting list around ?
i do apologise , but I have things down in the wrong order on my list .
madam president , in order to be correct , I think we have to vote on recital k now .
before the vote 
it is not just today that it has happened .
fr madam president , you are absolutely right .
the matter has a broader political dimension .
i cannot go against procedure , mr onesta .
it poses a great danger to the security and stability of the international community .
in memory of piotr stańczak , can I ask you all now to rise to commemorate him .
seven leading figures in the bahá í religious community were taken into custody in may 200for eight months , they were denied the opportunity of legal counsel .
on behalf of the european parliament , I protest to the strongest possible degree about these methods .

order of business
the following amendments have been proposed 
wednesday 
mr president , with your permission , we will also move to defer mr berman's report .
does anyone wish to oppose the motion ?
ladies and gentlemen , you have heard the political contexts .
the decision will be taken tomorrow .
we will vote on mr swoboda's motion tomorrow .
role of the european union in the middle east debate 
it is at the heart of our middle east policy .
all our actions have this strategic objective in mind .
we know that solutions and proposals should be locally inspired .
however , at the same time , deeper international engagement remains essential .
it remains , and should remain , on the table .
we have just had important elections in israel .
but it is clear that no single country or organisation can tackle the conflicts in the middle east alone .
in the coming months , we will also have elections in iran and in lebanon .
let me conclude by saying that 2009 will be critical for the middle east .
however , the time has come to focus decisively on conflict resolution .
it is the only way to end this endless sequence of death and destruction .
we also agreed that the quartet should consult closely on these matters before the end of the month .
finally , we need to step up our own engagement with the arab league countries .
much very delicate work is going on .
we are in regular contact with quartet colleagues .
we , as the commission , will be a co sponsor of this event .
we will certainly continue to work very closely with this house .
applause 
the embargo imposed on gaza means each delivery of humanitarian aid has to get through an obstacle course .
the hospitals can no longer operate properly .
the european union is already playing a major role in the region .
there is no solution through terrorism .
it may be the case that one party gains a short term military advantage .
to what extent is it prepared to engage in constructive dialogue , before and after the election in lebanon ?
without a unity government for the palestinians , the peace process is unmanageable .
in the middle east , everything is interconnected .
that is why the basis for everything is the readiness to talk .
this is a bold and ambitious plan , and it is one that needs to be discussed .
for this reason , our message can only be that dialogue is the precondition .
your work deserves more than respect .
we cannot go on like this .
last month's violence and the outcome of this month's election have changed the terms of the debate .
isolation has led only to despair .
its envoy , tony blair , has never even been to gaza .
there should be a free and fair international investigation into alleged war crimes in the gaza conflict .
however , the failure of our approach to date is written in spilled blood on the ground .
there is no such thing as anintelligentorsafebomb .
well , I agree .
israel refused the offer of the arab league in 2002 , ladies and gentlemen .
it has been in existence for seven years .
what has europe done to seize this opportunity ?
it should , however , be up to those who do the damage to pay .
i was one of the four people who worked on that programme .
therefore , we fully support those who are working to make the peace initiative a reality .
we see deep divisions within the arab league .
mr president , honourable members , as I have said , 2009 will be an enormously important year .
in any case , however , one thing is sure a military solution is no solution .
be assured that we will work for that .
the vote will take place today .
the humanitarian situation in gaza is unacceptable .
what are the principles by which it should be guided ?
the situation affecting gaza's population is tragic and must be resolved urgently .
role of the european union in the middle east vote 
i have been asked to welcome a visiting delegation in the gallery from the region of piedmont .
this aid must be provided without any conditions or restrictions .
what the heroic palestinian people need more than anything is not charity from the imperialists .
over 100 000 people have been displaced and more than 15 000 homes have been destroyed .
however , it is also essential to denounce the aggressors and hold them responsible .

in this year's report , we have decided to focus on policy making and policy shaping .
we are grateful this is a real achievement .
we regret , therefore , that as in previous years , the cfsp budget is seriously under funded .
we address horizontal and geographical issues in our report .
it should not be trying to duplicate them .
this is an important first step along the road .
we always speak of the security interests of the individual countries , but we do have common security interests .
if that is what we want , we will need the funds to bring it about .
we then make clear statements about the capabilities that we need to develop .
the events of the second world war gave birth to the eu .
mr solana has this number , which mr kissinger asked for years ago .
but what kinds of means are we member states and politicians giving to mr solana ?
we are talking about the toxic assets of banks and how we have to clear them .
we have to move on the eu has to move on in its peacebuilding .
we are day to day politicians who are short sighted .
what is the result of inefficient and failing security policies ?
we have idealism but we do not equip ourselves with the means to reach those targets .
what do we have to do ?
that was really when we began working on esdp .
i think that what I have said will resonate with the chairman of the committee on foreign affairs .
i think this is an important concept to keep in mind .
as you know , we have updated it in cooperation with the commission and parliament in 200let me say a word about piracy because that relates to our youngest operation , atalanta .
this maritime operation against piracy is conducted from a european operational headquarters in the united kingdom .
let me say a word about structures internal structures relating to esdp .
civilian action is not possible without a secure environment .
let me say a word about nato european union relations because they are covered in the report by mr vatanen .
as you know , we have a framework for cooperation that we call berlin plus .
without any doubt , this is going to be one of the most important issues facing us in 200we have to deliver and to deliver in a sensible manner .
more engagement will be needed .
i have had the opportunity to meet richard holbrooke already a couple of times , and general petraeus .
at this point , it is very important that we do better because we want to be better .
in georgia , additional eu post conflict financial support is being provided .
this exceptional ec assistance has contributed to preventing a major humanitarian crisis .
in chad , we have committed a total of eur 311 million under the 10th european development fund .
turning to energy , the gas crisis affecting the eu this year was unprecedented in its effect .
with regard to energy security , it is clear that we have lessons to draw .
but we will try to go and do what these expectations require from us .
it relates to developments in connection with the missile defence system in poland and the czech republic .
these are things that we welcome .
my group is opposed to glossing over our own work .
mr solana , you are absolutely right .
so what is it that we are talking about , then ?
this report discusses a new concept safe .
we believe this is wrong .
what is needed is the disbandment of nato .
we will therefore be voting against these two reports .
this is essential , after all .
someone spoke about helicopters .
the helicopter has today become an essential crisis management tool .
fi mr president , ladies and gentlemen , my thanks go to the three rapporteurs .
china and india are growing , not only in economic power , but also in military might .
europe's competitive advantage should be based on knowledge and innovation .
this should be nurtured and supported by all of us .
innovation creates new business and jobs .
it is a political tool in the advancement of an integrated europe .
this would actually be helpful .
there is nothing new in what is now fashionably calledthe comprehensive approach.
we used to call ithearts and minds.
concerning the mediterranean , we have objected to a reductionist approximation that only talks about security .
respect is needed for the position of the republic of cyprus .
that approach is antiquated .
indeed , this is also mentioned repeatedly in the report by mr saryusz wolski .
we have the resources .
will we , one day , have the will ?
the so called european diplomacy did not join the prior talks aimed at securing his release .
mr von wogau advocates an eu standing army of 60 000 soldiers permanently available for deployment .
ladies and gentlemen , you are completely inconsistent .
we are their friends , but we do not wish to be their vassals and still less their lackeys .
we have to put an end to this and get out of it .
nato has had its time .
i would therefore ask you to please keep to your speaking times .
the new administration has made a very positive start , also symbolically by the announcement to close down guantánamo .
this brings the european union in immediately .
these countries must be allowed to decide themselves on their security policy solutions , without any pressure from outside .
it is the superpowers of the united states and russia who are active in these areas , not europe !
the message from this parliament is unequivocal and serves as a warning .
europe's role as a global player in crisis management may be threatened .
at the time , the european community was powerless .
in other words , the european union as a global player is the desired solution .
it is my view that these negotiations should also include discussions on the topic of missile defence .
consensus exists about this among the main political forces .
secondly , I would like to emphasise the question of human rights in the development of eu external policy .
the policy should support international law international humanitarian law , liberal democracy and the rule of law .
secondly , on institutions .
i feel that the european union and nato must cooperate with each other , avoiding any potential rivalry .
i would like to hear something from you on this subject .
perhaps he is not listening .
not much , apart from act as witnesses .
firstly , I would like to stress the importance of the transatlantic aspect to the eu's foreign policy .
we know this is a very important part .
i will certainly be in touch with you to respond to those who have to be responded to properly .
is it enough ?
is there more convergence between institutions like parliament , council , the commission and member states ?
the answer isno.
how does this like mindedness come about ?
the question of values was raised .
do we agree on values ?
this is a very real risk I can envisage .
therefore , I do support these two concepts , but not for the security policy .
then there is the european security strategy , which now has everyone's support .
the work that needed to be done on this took several years and was very successful .
anybody of sound mind is a pacifist .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 february 200written statements rule 142 
the ratification of the lisbon treaty and the foreign policy tools outlined therein may contribute greatly to this goal .
yet it is not a position that europe could or should have followed .
we , in our own and their interests , must have the capacity to engage without the americans .
let us allow some time to pass , however , and just see how nato develops .
we also need regional security and close ties with the relevant regional players .
international security is one of the greatest values for all the subjects of international relations .
without a solution to these fundamental questions , creation of a stable european security strategy is not possible .
this would definitely be a solution for the turkey issue from nato's point of view .
thank you !
the nabucco project must be adopted as a strategic goal by the whole eu .
the barcelona process union for the mediterranean debate 
these approaches together encourage reform within individual countries , and reinforce regional cooperation .
the first is interparliamentary cooperation through the creation of the euro mediterranean parliamentary assembly and its committees .
it will , as is pointed out in your resolution , serve to reinforce its democratic legitimacy .
it will also help promote the basic values which lie at the heart of the european union .
the second area which I believe should be a particular priority for us is the development of intercultural relations .
civil society , local social and regional partners all need to be involved .
there is , therefore , no reason to call it into question today .
the opening of the secretariat in barcelona has been postponed indefinitely , and the money promised cannot come in .
it is precisely because political conflicts are blocking this process that we should strengthen the economic field .
communicating the benefits of economic integration to local citizens will play an important role in this .
i wish to see this for the sake of us all , particularly the citizens in the region .
first , to guarantee the continuity of the barcelona process with the union for the mediterranean .
this is what the union for the mediterranean is , after all .
and who knows ?
thank you , mrs napoletano , for this excellent report .
it was a conference on water .
this is how crucial it is .
certainly , the union for the mediterranean is a significant step forward in the efforts for the euro mediterranean partnership .
let me give you an example .
this fragmentation makes visibility suffer .
pt my thanks go to my colleague , pasqualina napoletano , for her excellent report .
although we can only learn through our mistakes , making progress by speeding up the reaction is absolutely crucial .
in truth , this union was born during the french presidency under the star sign of mistakes .
there are also clear rules on the programme agreements and a euro mediterranean investment bank .
the question raised concerns how we can pursue this strategy .
the model followed in barcelona has not had the expected results .
mrs napoletano's report goes against this perception .
however , we do not want the union to suffer the same problem as the barcelona process .
it apparently encompasses many projects and many areas of action , but the priorities are not correctly ranked .
finally , mr president , I must mention the middle east conflict .
the list of speakers has been exhausted .
regional cooperation is most needed in the area of tackling threats to the environment .
finally , I simply want to stress the concern about poverty and social exclusion , which seriously affect women .
you have prepared a really interesting document .
we just need to move .
there are the resources which , as far as I know , come to over eur 1 billion .
do not worry then .
that is the only difference .
moreover , when mrs kratsa went to marseille , we gave her a lot of support on this issue .
thank you all for this debate .
the baltic sea strategy will be one of the priorities under the swedish presidency .
the eu is an integrated community and the long term strategic development of all its regions has equal importance .
regrettably , there are still several countries that have serious problems in this domain .
the fundamental freedoms of free movement of labour and free trade are being put to the test .
the crisis is following different paths in different countries .
mr president , I received some strange news from northern ireland last week .
however , this month corticeira amorim has announced that nearly 200 workers will be laid off .
polish legislation does not give meps any legal instruments which ensure the effective fulfilment of their mandate .
i believe it is important that the positive role of europe must be highlighted through our education systems .
es mr president , a year and a half ago , we adopted the audiovisual media directive .
citizens of hungarian origin are represented proportionally in the local administrative structures .
we need country of origin labelling so consumers are able to make informed choices .
this is a de facto and de jure situation .
the czech page about germany displays köln as kolín , while the french page displays cologne .
buildings are responsible for 40 % of the consumption of primary energy .
it can pick you up but it is addictive and leads to economic death . 
de mr president , I should like to put forward two suggestions .
i think that this is a pity , and that it is a bad habit .
and I think that the president should react to this situation .
the eastern partnership is a timely answer to the expectations of our european neighbours to the east .
it is very difficult to see russia as a partner in this area .
the preliminary findings of our review point exactly in the same direction .
moreover , instruments such as twinning and taiex provide support for institution building , legislative approximation and regulatory alignment .
there is always room for improvement and I am always grateful for suggestions .
however , let us be honest .
i think that is really true .
we have just heard about not creating one thing to the financial detriment of another .
that is why the capabilities of the neighbourhood instrument need to be promoted in the right way .
let us actively use these opportunities .
i ask the commission to take this concern into consideration .
how can we effectively review this neighbourhood and partnership instrument ?
our actions must always be well conceived so that citizens can see specific benefits from them .
this partnership significantly raises the level of commitment by both sides .
i am , of course , very thankful for many of the suggestions .
so , as you can see , we are nearly at the same level .
today , however , it is certainly important to add political content to our neighbourhood policy .
new financing discussions will begin this year .
this unprecedented economic crisis , which is biting hard , spells renewed disaster for developing countries .
whilst eu funding in this area is to be welcomed , it is not fighting poverty .
a financial source and a legal basis that do not come under development policy will need to be found .
this was in response to parliament's request during the final negotiations on the instruments .
the review is about the implementation of the instruments .
we recognise that there is a problem with non oda activities .
by their nature , such activities do not qualify as development assistance .
finally , I see that the report calls for more resources .
this should allow an adjustment of the different headingsceilings .
but , of course , sponsoring concert tours or athletestravel costs does not .
this much appreciated report deals with the results of those deficiencies .
i came to this debate because I was anxious to hear the arguments about legal bases .
let us just call a spade a spade .
the difficulty is that we are not .
small and medium sized enterprises have a very special role to play in this .
creditworthiness is particularly important during financial crises , so that these enterprises can still obtain microcredit .
perhaps I am concerned because I am a journalist .
written statements rule 142 
this alone , however , will not be enough .
the commission will make all possible efforts to support the implementation of these amendments by the council .
after all , it is also important that these research results continue to be presented and made available .
imagine if an international legal research framework had been established 50 years ago .
successful reforms then spread to other countries .
my questions are as follows .
ro 2009 is the european year of creativity and innovation .
i would be interested in taking two minutes , if that was in order ?
well , you present me with a quandary .
the rules of procedure state one minute .
one minute .
i want just two minutes I do not know about the other colleagues .
thank you for allowing me to trespass on your patience , mr president .
i have two quick points .
when there were collapses in their gdp , the public sector investment in r & d went up .
i will refer here to a statement made by mrs doyle .
therefore , I endorse the measures concerning the establishment of a legal framework for the european research infrastructure .
the question of appropriate taxation is also important in this case .
i trust , therefore , that the eri will improve this situation .
member of the commission . mr president , firstly I would like to thank you for your support .
i may not follow the order of the questions but will try to respond briefly to what you asked .
on the cost of patent application , it is very striking .
betterwould certainly be an answer which would be more horizontal than anything which we could do .
it is not intended that we finance institutionally the infrastructure .
that is really the only way ahead .
we do not propose vat exemption in the legislation .
today , the countries are individually negotiating with the host country on that kind of exemption .
the answer is yes .
to finish , that is exactly the point which we have to underline .
we need infrastructure .
this is the step to speed up the whole process .
we now come to our rapporteur , mrs riera madurell .
we take note of this comment .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 february 200written statements rule 142 
this gives the community the ability to participate in and guide trans european research policies .
establishing european research infrastructures guarantees that research will reach a high level .
the cost of establishing large scale research infrastructures requires several countries to join forces .
a special place for children in eu external action short presentation 
i think it is both comprehensive and ambitious .
commissioner , I now look forward very much to seeing actions intended to match the ambition which I see .
we need to see substance backing up the rhetoric .
we recognise that the eu needs a strategy on children .
the committee on development then started drafting a report .
we will surely use it in our work on children .
how do we ensure that we involve children in decisions that concern them ?
how do we ensure that children have access to pertinent information ?
this is just the start of a long process .
we should build on the collective force of the two institutions to advance this important issue .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 february 200written statements rule 142 
undertake a thorough analysis of children's rights 
build up existing youth and children's networks as sustainable platforms for consulting children 
i have taken a particular interest in the issue of children's rights in the context of foreign relations .
i succeeded in introducing statements condemning gender based eugenic discrimination , which is increasingly common in some countries .
they represent 99 % of companies and employ over 100 million people .
workersrights to information and consultation are essential components of the social market economy .
we proposed the recasting of the directive on european work councils .
this has been successfully completed .
the item is closed .
my report has three objectives .
it can , I believe , help to sustain our social systems when times are hard .
the third objective is to decide what we can do in practice to support this sector .
where and at what level should consultation and dialogue with the european commission take place ?
it is up to the commission to assess this .
the item is closed .
this is a grass roots vision that represents a fundamental contribution to the european social model .
such institutions cannot be replaced by any market oriented organisation .
if this concept is unknown to society , its solidarity is unable to help .
participating organisations , on the other hand , are too small to become known on a macro economic level .
the social economy ensures job stability as it is not subject to delocalisation .
mental health short presentation 
vulnerable and marginalised groups , such as disabled people , are more likely to suffer mental health problems .
we call on the commission to present the conclusions of the thematic conferences .
employers are increasingly aware of the links between wellbeing and productivity .
csr europe has even created a toolkit for wellbeing in the workplace .
these will be joint events with council presidencies and member states .
parliament's report includes many concrete suggestions which constitute a valuable contribution to future debates in these conferences .
the item is closed .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 february 200written statements rule 142 
one in four people suffer from mental health problems at least once in their life .
awareness of this issue should therefore be raised among businesses and public bodies .
you pointed out that we have slightly dimmed the lighting in the chamber .
commissioner , the gas crisis in january certainly had one positive outcome .
let us also remember that improving energy efficiency can also reduce the burden on the most vulnerable consumers .
at the same time , our goal was to define necessary future steps in eu legislation .
what is more , energy efficiency programmes can create hundreds of thousands of jobs in europe .
in a year of massive layoffs , this aspect is hardly beside the point .
we could and should try to change the situation through diversification and solidarity .
it is essential that member states which are most dependent on energy supplies have sufficient reserves of these supplies .
i also urge the commission to support national authorities , particularly in the form of technical assistance .
it is vital that we establish interesting and rewarding university courses that offer good professional opportunities .
i think that is how research should be done in the future .
this is what this is all about , after all .
it is my firm belief that the experiment has proven its effect beyond any doubt .
he took the view that tax policy was not intended for this purpose .
it was deleted in amendment 6 and re introduced in amendment this can only create confusion .
therefore , further extensions of the scope of the proposal should not be considered in this context .
we are now tabling the text for a resolution , which is a good thing .
as usual , I will politely , but firmly , reject her call .
we had made a great effort to compromise .
she did not think it was worth making the slightest effort to accept any of our proposals .
that is ridiculous .
why complicate matters ?
why look for public health issues where there is no reason for there to be any ?
this measure supporting the food industry is becoming increasingly necessary , madam president .
if we think that the commission's proposal is good , then we must support it .
let us make use of it .
let us put an end to legal uncertainty and harmonise the basis on which member states can intervene .
you have struck the right balance and it is an intelligent one .
these are the right choices , according to two criteria .
we could also talk about mandeville and private vice for public virtue .
however , it has been rejected by the majority in the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
it will secure , and hopefully create , jobs .
of course , we on the left welcome the reduction in vat rates as a matter of principle .
high and very high earners must bear a greater tax burden .
this is something positive for a change from the grand coalition in the federal republic of germany .
of the amendments tabled , we support those that are in favour of extending the reduced vat rates .
greece is going to need bailing out but by whom ?
economies are in dire straits all over the world .
some of them will pull through .
lt the regulation of vat reductions has long been an area demanding a systemic approach .
price growth , which is disproportionate to an increase in vat , clearly shows who benefits .
i am pleased that the commission's proposal being debated is using a different evaluation of copenhagen economics .
wherever possible , therefore , the vat rate in the newly accepted countries should be as low as possible .
at this time of recession this can stimulate recovery , growth and jobs .
now back to report we are discussing today .
the building sector has the largest number of jobs .
this results in enormous budgetary losses and an increase in unregistered employment .
moreover , it will promote an increase in both productivity and employment .
perhaps we should do the opposite .
from the point of view of competitiveness , europe is a service economy .
compared with the usa , our sales tax , or value added tax , is much higher .
for the commission , there were two options .
in times of crisis , these measures can be an important incentive for a number of industries .
before the vote 
it was approved unanimously , with one vote against I think , in the committee on constitutional affairs .
community legal framework for a european research infrastructure eri 
european professional card for service providers 
this can form a nice little example to use in the election campaigns and I am therefore pleased .
the committee was unanimous on this issue and so that is all I have to say .
voting time
it is a great pleasure to welcome them here today .
the visitors have also had an opportunity to experience , at first hand , the workings of our parliament .
i wish the delegation well for the remainder of their stay in the european union .
reduced rates of value added tax 
although I have been here several times before I have never had the chance to address a plenary session .
you are surely well aware of this too , ladies and gentlemen .
history has no end point .
and those people include the citizens of the czech republic .
in a normal parliamentary system there is a group supporting the government and another supporting the opposition .
here only one alternative exists and those who dare consider other alternatives are labelled enemies of european integration .
the only solution lies in the liberalisation and deregulation of the european economy .
i say all this because I care about a democratic and prosperous future for europe .
i firmly believe that the citizens of the various member states want freedom , democracy and economic prosperity .
thank goodness that we live in a european democracy in which we can all express our opinions .
applause and uproar 
applause 
however , it is now the european parliament that decides .
the role of nato in the security architecture of the eu 
it is unconditional .
that is what we have to do .
on behalf of the ppe de group . madam president , I have two oral amendments to this paragraph .
please support this more european position .
i ask therefore for the application for referral back to committee to be withdrawn .
madam president , I would like to second the rapporteur .
mixed reactions 
president klaus was able to speak here unhindered .
we now continue with the vote .
however , I voted against the report , owing to its pro abortion stance .
it was written in 1989 , in an age before we knew about predators .
it also includes abortion , which has no place in children's rights .
he made a speech that was in some ways almost platitudinous .
what could be more social than making a profit to re invest to create jobs for your population ?
pl madam president , 90 % of suicides are the result of mental health problems .
they say that learning comes at a price and we have paid that price .
using the most up to date science as a tool can only help the task ahead of us .
how does a free society combat those who wish to destroy it ?
they did not succeed .
that will continue under the lisbon treaty .
that mandate expires on 15 march 200that really demonstrates the vital importance of nato and its maintenance .
how are we seeking to undermine this ?
let us not forget the vital role that nato has played long may it continue .
we will retain our neutrality under the lisbon treaty the treaty will not change our position on that .
that equal opportunities are still lacking ?
all they want to do is be negative and oppose everything .
alternative means of redress may be recommended .
the new rules will facilitate the processing of petitions , thereby supporting citizensinterests .
however , the june list is immovable in respect of the issue of tax policy .
i have therefore voted against the commission's proposal and the report .
it is therefore a useful tool for developing the fisheries industry .
i have voted against this motion for a resolution .
this is unacceptable .
for this reason all european employers and hired workers must know and recognise this european social model procedure .
in writing . I support this report which was initiated by the socialist group .
extending workforce size thresholds regardless of age or type of employment contract to cover all workers
social economy enterprises are characterised by a form of enterprise that differs from the capital enterprise model .
the third sector plays a leading role in the european economy , combining profitability and solidarity .
europeans dread losing their jobs and expect decent treatment .
i support the rapporteur's motion .
the european commission has withdrawn two proposals intended to put in place statutes for european mutual societies and associations .
a europe in which creativity is harnessed and the dignity of each citizen is protected for the common good .
i welcome this and have voted in favour of the report .
we need to consider some of the figures given by the report , particularly 
in writing . the tzampazi report deals with an important health issue .
similarly , it is said that by 2010 depression will become the most common illness in modern society .
the average figure for poor countries is 0.05 psychiatrists per 100 000 inhabitants .
the problem is exacerbated in very many countries by the migration of specialist medical staff .
one person in four will experience some form of mental health disorder at least once in their lives .
i welcome the result of this resolution .
we are employing energy ever more rationally .
more rational energy management has thus contributed to economic growth in all the member states .
in writing . sv we swedish social democrats have chosen to abstain .
the eu must act quickly to put an end to the problems of overfishing and threatened stocks .
this has to be the starting point and focus of the common fisheries policy .
this is obvious in view of this sector's economic , social and political importance in the eu .
in the long term , objectives will be more compatible .
this will result in the disappearance of whole species .
a definite environmental perspective should permeate all research in the fisheries sector .
i support the report's intention to facilitate the mobility of professionals and to guarantee the safety of consumers .
in writing . it madam president , I voted for the report .
employers must not be able to avoid applying labour law rules by utilising a complex chain of subcontractors .
we believe that people without documents are just as vulnerable , even if they are working for private individuals .
it was with this hope that I voted in favour of this report .
the proposal that we are voting on today has many shortcomings .
expulsion should not be the alternative to over exploitation of illegally staying migrant workers .
there are no measures in relation to the policy of expelling illegal immigrants back to their country of origin .
we reject this philosophy that is dangerous for the people and nations of europe .
the proposal to punish employers who use illegal citizens is timely .
there is an absence of this type of legislation in certain countries within the eu .
the proposal that we are voting on today has many shortcomings .
if the decision had been ours , many parts of it would have been different .
the current proposal exemplifies the measures taken .
the ball is now in the governmentscourt .
we stress that it is for member states to decide when it is appropriate to apply these measures .
islamist jihadi extremists pose a threat to our very way of life .
politicians have a responsibility to protect the public against this unprecedented and existentialist danger .
once again the anti americanism so prevalent in the eu put its citizenssafety in jeopardy .
that is why I will abstain .
it is equally telling that the uk labour members abstained .
this shifts the focus from the main issue , which is that of the suspected violations of human rights .
in writing . eplp meps believe that this resolution contains a number of points of merit .
taiwan is a prosperous democracy with a top quality public health system .
i welcome the report's positive comments about the improvement in cross straits relations .
nevertheless , I welcome the council's recent expression of support for taiwan's meaningful participation in international organisations .
i therefore voted to approve this report .
just like two others debated and adopted in this sitting , this report is also very ambitious .
cooperation with other countries plays an enormous role in this field .
in this regard , relations with russia , ukraine , georgia and belarus are worthy of note .
this is exactly as to be expected .
taiwan's exclusion from this body at the behest of china is reprehensible .
i voted to abstain on this report .
for these reasons , we abstained overall .
in writing . pl mr president , I supported mr von wogau's report .
our neighboursseemingly bilateral conflicts have a direct impact on the eu .
it actually goes even further as itcalls for the setting up of an . eu operational headquarters.
in writing . british labour meps joined with the socialist group in voting in favour of this report .
the report envisions further unacceptable transfer of national competence in defence and security to the eu .
strengthening the european union's military credibility is , however , indispensable .
i therefore elected to abstain .
the report states that nato forms the core of european security .
i believe that europe's security is enhanced by the eu's common foreign and security policy .
when the soviet union and the warsaw pact disappeared , this nato lost its raison d être .
its continued existence is a problem for the eu , because six member states have opted for military neutrality .
a first step towards this consolidation may be an operational headquarters for the european union .
the location of europe dictates its security priorities and concerns .
the usa and nato must be regarded as partners not as rivals .
clearly from time to time changes in global strategic interests mean adjusting priorities and approaches .
in this connection , separate , permanent structures have been put in place .
in writing . it madam president , ladies and gentlemen , I voted for this report .
however , overall we support the report and therefore have voted in favour .
these activities should expand the free trade zone .
this principle ought to extend to all the activities carried out by the publications office .
that concludes the explanations of vote .
resumption of the session
those who perpetrated these terrorist acts must be brought to justice and made to account for their horrific crimes .
their attacks do not command political support from the people of northern ireland .
such is what happens when you treat with terrorists .
we pay tribute to their legacy today .

order of business
then we would be able to vote on both requests on wednesday .
parliament approved the request 
parliament should simply take a clear position , to put an end to this debate once and for all .
i think he is right the commission's behaviour is certainly remarkable , to put it politely .
the second part is the resolution .
i now give the floor to mr fjellner , who may present a different position again .
de mr president , this should not be made any more complicated .
i believe that would be a further reaching request on which you could hold an initial vote .
the committee meets this evening , and the debate on the report remains on the agenda for wednesday .
thursday 
i therefore feel it is crucial that we not only talk but also take decisions .
for this reason we are requesting that a resolution be put to the vote in addition to the debate .
darfur is now an item on the agenda .
abuses of this kind must be stopped and the law must be enforced .
today , israel must not obstruct the will of the palestinian people .
applause 
this relates only to the association's list , however , not to the fund .
that cannot be allowed to happen !
that will mean an ability to manufacture nuclear weapons on an industrial scale .
there are certain things in this life for me which cannot be bought or sold .
this statement truly illustrates the will of and the path being taken by the workers .
i am glad that a charge of libel has been filed regarding this matter .
interestingly , no such accusations have been levelled against the old member states .
the world then will not forget , but mere words will have little effect , madam president .
the developing economic crisis threatens to cause a serious rise in unemployment levels .
this may lead to an increase in the problem of street children .
it is playing with fire to behave like this in times of such uncertainty .
sv madam president , many , like me , are concerned about the growing anti semitism in europe .
it was no ordinary match .
i would like to remind those who have forgotten that the tibetan uprising began on 10 march .
they are important subjects .
perhaps it isworld type approval for heavy goods vehicles dayortype approval inspectors day.
as we approach the european elections , I think that we should not raise such issues .
time is of the essence and I therefore hope that a framework mediation agreement will be drawn up shortly .
it is clear that short term aid must be provided to the farmers to help them survive .
bg thank you , madam president .
international women's day is an occasion for us to take stock of our gender equality policy .
in 2007 the european parliament adopted the report on the role of sport in education .
if we think back to 30 years ago , there is much to be concerned about .
hu I have spoken up several times on behalf of the traditional national minorities .
it is unacceptable for the state to interfere detrimentally in the life of a church .
bg thank you , madam president .
this would be a violation of basic cultural and national conventions for any civilised country .
it is intolerable and very serious .
pl madam president , today I do not want to raise a question of a political nature .
from a technical point of view , the matter is very simple .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports 
the european parliament expects the draft 2010 budget to help member states and citizens overcome the current crisis .
we ask the european commission to take our requests seriously .
i ask that you debate the proposals and then support them with your votes .
we must exclude matters unconnected with our mission from the budget as much as possible .
there are numerous examples .
neither do we need to have guards physically present in some places , especially in strasbourg and luxembourg .
we can achieve further savings running into millions if we improve cooperation between the institutions .
in various cases previously institutions have purchased or leased property at prices above the market rate .
thank you .
firstly , the emphasis on lawmaking .
in 2010 , foreign policy will , as in previous years , be a tricky issue .
i hope so .
we should remember that solidarity is most important during hard times .
it is like using the cavalry to attack a modern , mechanised army with guided missiles .
in these areas , too , the eu's budget is thoroughly negligible .
the same applies to energy policy .
what is lacking is consensus , and also dialogue .
as mr surján said , the available budget is tight 1 % of gross national product .
this concerns energy supply and energy security .
we should not be throwing more money at those who are earning enough as it is .
if we do support companies , why nabucco ?
why do we want to favour a hungarian company over an italian one , for example ?
what is your justification for this ?
in the face of the crisis , our european citizens want us to provide solution mechanisms .
they expect us to provide assistance .
the european union , with its scant resources , absolutely cannot afford this .
there are also some small matters in this house .
we have a great deal more work ahead of us in this regard .
the russian ukrainian gas crisis has pointed to europe's dependency in terms of gas supply .
this budget points beyond itself .
today there is something else at stake .
thanks to their amendment proposal the entire draft is of a higher quality .
i would like once again to thank all of my colleagues .
i look forward to our continuing cooperation .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 10 march 200written statements rule 142 
particular attention must be given to north south networks .
the next item is the joint debate on 
i wish to say a few words about the background .
this offer of a separate company form is particularly directed at europe's small and medium sized enterprises .
the story is similar to that of the european company .
my sincere thanks for your attention .
we also believe , therefore , that honest entrepreneurs who suffer business failure deserve a second chance .
we are grateful for your support .
there are those who consider such a cross border requirement essential for a european company forum .
all of these make a helpful contribution which will facilitate the application of this statute .
the commission , therefore , welcomes the adoption of this report .
however , we are not convinced that proposing new legislation now is the best solution to achieve this objective .
court of justice case law clearly allows for company mobility .
the cross border mergers directive was due to be transposed by member states by december 200it is too early to assess its full application .
on no account must existing rights be curtailed .
employeesrights are core rights for a social europe .
my call for labour law to provide a reliable basis for smes has also been incorporated .
impact assessments are to be carried out systematically in the case of new laws .
before their adoption , all eu provisions must be examined in terms of their impact on smes .
we must act quickly to take advantage of this potential .
we need to act quickly on this .
these initiatives were appreciated but inadequate .
he should take seriously the fact that parliament really wants him to present this proposal .
we now ask for it to be done immediately afterwards .
we found a very good compromise with the rapporteur .
i will take two examples .
that is included in point 87 regarding the cohesion fund .
second example red tape .
unfortunately , it is totally different now that it has arrived , accompanied by the european private company .
this has been the task of the committee on legal affairs .
i should like to congratulate mrs herczog on this report .
i congratulate you , therefore what are needed now are tax cuts for labour intensive sectors .
madam president , I too would like to welcome this report .
also , the cutting of red tape and bureaucracy by the commission has to be welcomed .
that amounts to savings for the european union of about eur 2.3 million .
there are major differences between member states in this regard .
we cannot allow social standards to slip .
we assert that they are essential to the health of the european economy .
the 23 million european smes cannot be subject to the same requirements as the 41 000 large undertakings .
if ever small businesses needed something , it is the reduction of administrative burdens .
however , I have two reservations .
secondly , I have personal doubts about the merits and benefits of changing the late payment directive .
otherwise , the majority of the good recommendations made herein will remain a dead letter .
mentorship is particularly important in encouraging such activities .
i would just like to comment on one point .
the vote will take place tomorrow , tuesday , at 12 noon .
his absence is due to preparations for that .
i wish to respond to some of the points raised .
this will also help facilitate subsidies for the production of green products .
mr karas spoke on the small business act sba .
we will therefore know more , and this culture of mainstreaming and support will grow .
follow up measures will be considered when the full assessment is completed in 20some points were made on why there was not more input into taxation and accounting .
i see many friends of smes here .
we therefore need to strike the right balance between freedom of establishment and the interests of third parties .
europe could be more innovative and creative in supporting smes .
we are talking here about reducing bureaucracy and trying to make things easier for smes .
my second point concerns participation .
it is practically only abuses that are being recorded .
last year , the largest member state , germany , abandoned this theory .
thank you very much for your support .
the vote will take place on thursday .
i would just like to highlight two absolutely essential aspects .
in most cases , the owner is a man , while any women are regarded as unpaid family workers .
smes account for more than 90 % of the eu economy and two thirds of its jobs .
the truth is specific .
this ensures that the workers get some insight into the position and future of the enterprise .
perhaps the commission's proposal will be improved slightly in the forthcoming negotiations .
perhaps the text that is finally adopted will not be so bad .
we must ensure that international conventions are correctly applied , as well as cooperation agreements with third countries .
agreements cannot be made with countries that have not signed the geneva convention .
asylum is not a concession asylum is a duty for states and a right for those fleeing war .
it shares our ambition to build a more protective , more effective and more just european asylum system .
the proposed amendments to the directive on reception conditions should provide an answer to these problems .
we must also arrive at a better definition of responsibilities in the case of people rescued at sea .
where should they disembark ?
naturally , one has to be aware of the pressures the asylum systems are under in some member states .
these eur 10 million will be used relocate more refugees in the union in 200i would really like to thank parliament for its support .
it is indeed my intention to include this in the stockholm programme .
in 2007 , the eu received more than 200 000 asylum applications .
finally , for us it is vital that we reform the dublin ii system .
this development is worrying , to say the least .
we already have international conventions that specify this .
almost every week we hear horrific reports from refugee camps in southern europe .
i fully share the view that it is unfortunate that entry into force has been postponed until 20what nevertheless still concerns me is the fact that children can be taken into custody .
for what crimes other than people trafficking is cooperation a requirement for asylum ?
the third issue is how different countries receive asylum seekers and which countries are chosen .
all this is a recipe for chaos and gridlock in national asylum systems .
but the easier we make it for them to come to europe , the more will come .
the harmonisation of standards is definitely worthy of support .
we have a duty and , as martine roure said , a moral imperative to do so .
i would like to give some clarifications .
i am thinking in particular of mr busuttil , who mentioned the difficult situation malta faces in this matter .
finally , and to close , some members have raised the question of border controls .
the debate is closed .
in recent months , the necessity to take action has not waned but has instead become even more urgent .
force can only be eliminated by striking at its roots .
this concerns not only central and eastern european countries , who long for peace , but every european citizen .
thank you for your patience .
that concludes this item .
the vote will take place on wednesday .
representative organisations and roma communities must play an active role in drawing up inclusion policies .
the opportunities for mobility have had the totally opposite effect for them , making discrimination worse .
the unusual reactions which we have seen in italy are a warning .
nevertheless , the eca has not been able to give the commission a positive statement of assurance for years .
it concludes that considerable progress has been achieved during the term of the current commission .
this is helping to reduce the administrative burden and allowing better use to be made of control results .
this concept aims to define at the policy level the acceptable balance between the control results and their costs .
our last report shows you that the commission has completed the various actions .
i thank mrs stauner for her report , which is a call to improve our accounting framework still further .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
in the current economic situation we cannot allow any wasteful spending or misuse of european funds .
integrity of online gambling short presentation 
however , not all gambling is the same .
3. cooperation between member states should be strengthened significantly 
5. we need more research in the area and finally
it was voted through with 32 votes in favour and 10 against .
written statements rule 142 
it is necessary to start from the fact that most european states have a gambling industry .
the commission welcomes the support for its policy of simplification toward trading standards .
therefore , mrs petre , you spur us on and encourage us to continue our work .
the procedures should be simplified or , at least , speeded up .
the question of an agency remains open .
in the meantime , the advantages and disadvantages of such a body need to be studied with care .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
written statements rule 142 
thus , food quality schemes do not only provide consumers authentic products but can also support rural development .
eu standards for placing food on the market are already among the toughest in the world .
eu food is distinguished by its high quality and correspondingly high standards .
the ideal solution would be to use physical means .
i think the task is quite a difficult one .
such was the regulation .
what does it say ?
progress has also been noted in the speed with which requests for the taking of evidence are handled .
however , it is imperative that its operation be improved .
as for the use of videoconferencing , that too will be made a priority .
we hope to take advantage of the new financing methods during the revision of the 2010 2013 financial perspective .
in any event , thank you for this helpful report which has been most enlightening .
that concludes this item .
the report calls on the commission to take steps quickly to correct these deficiencies .
the economic crisis has taught us that strict auditing and oversight are indispensible .
a dashboard is regularly published on our website .
i thank parliament for its support for these two initiatives .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
facing oil challenges short presentation 
how can we lower our consumption or cover it with other energy sources too ?
we also need to think about how to exploit all the available reserves as efficiently as possible .
that was a brief summary of the substance of this report .
the commission gives a favourable welcome to most of the points raised in mr reul's report .
the item is closed .
the vote will take place on wednesday .
oil is an outdated source .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
i fully support the commission conclusion that european energy markets are not functioning properly .
consumers are frequently misled by deliberately confusing online offers and advertisement despite european legislation that seeks to prevent this .
agenda for next sitting see minutes
the sitting was closed at 10.55 p.m. 
closure of the session
i declare the 2008 2009 session of the european parliament closed .
we were then debating an assessment of the area of freedom , security and justice .
this measure will lead to a significant improvement in the safety of european roads , especially of our motorways .
all I can say is that this could reduce the numbers of deaths and injuries by around 35 000 .
what we are aiming to adopt today represents a milestone when it comes to improving road safety .
this regulation will make european cars safer .
allow me to begin with the aspect of safety , which was the most important element in this project .
the costs to manufacturers will be far outweighed by the overall economic benefit .
that is , therefore , a really very noteworthy contribution .
i am very pleased that that is exactly how the european parliament sees it .
not every issue was covered , but that is the way with compromises .
the introduction of mandatory safety systems for vehicles is something I particularly welcome .
this must also unconditionally apply to tyre safety .
lane departure warning systems and electronic stability control are also important .
as regards lorries , 90 % of tyres already meet the noise levels contained in the compromise .
overall , we have achieved a good compromise .
it is one area above all where regulation has a definite role to play .
this differs from the commission proposal the economic crisis was misused to submit an atrocious proposal .
indeed , everyone complains that it lacks substance , and yet it is evidently being accepted .
in particular , I would like to emphasise once again what mrs rühle said .
that is why it is so important that this is now quickly rectified .
one part of these additional measures has now been regulated .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
written statements rule 142 
we are therefore helping a competitive car industry .
in order to obtain a permit , they must be better than the specification from the safety network .
there will be absolutely no need for stretchable derogations that are open to interpretation .
that and I will put this somewhat carefully is an exaggeration .
some member states have been simply overlooking the need to invest in modernising their plants for years .
the same applies to inspections by the authorities .
farmers have many more items on their wish lists , and the decision about these two points is appropriate .
i can understand that members of the ppe de group might not be completely satisfied with the various compromises .
i would also like to thank the committee on legal affairs for its positive contribution .
furthermore , it is distorting competition between european industries .
we must support the approval procedure and the institution of the bref in general .
this will make a further contribution towards improving environmental protection and the viability of european industry .
i therefore await your views on this important proposal and the constructive dialogue that will follow with interest .
greater effort is also required from the european commission , however .
therefore , I very much support the rapporteur's idea of setting a minimum standard .
personally , I am prepared to see a trade off .
that is exactly where we have to go .
this also strengthens our suppliers of green technology in europe .
you have negotiated all these compromises with us in a good way .
i myself worked on the soil protection directive .
to conclude , I welcome the limitation and inclusion of provisions on incinerators .
i think that in this light we should consolidate this debate with a house vote .
sometimes , it seems that this is the only environmental problem .
al gore has left a clear mark .
recent case law has shown this not to be the case .
for this reason , we want to remove these options for further extension of the derogations .
that amendment will save money at a critical time for health budgets .
people have enough to blame the eu for without that !
secondly , the minimum requirements for large combustion plants present significant problems for parts of the uk power sector .
finally , I am greatly concerned by and opposed to the european safety net .
i would ask all members to consider these points carefully before voting .
after such a period , the techniques have moved on far ahead of us .
i find the hysteria when we deal with soil protection or the wishes of the farmersunions incomprehensible .
the socialist group in the european parliament wants to achieve environmental targets without impeding economic activities .
this is disproportionate and therefore not sensible .
i would like to thank mrs jackson for her proposal for an amendment .
mr president , I will stick specifically to agriculture .
we have heard many times in this chamber the question of food security .
i am going to ask you a simple question , and please try to answer it today .
it is an instrument for solving problems and one that we should give a chance to .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 10 march 200written statements rule 142 
this is a subject that touches upon fundamental and sometimes conflicting rights of citizens , associations and undertakings .
parliament , council and commission are much more open now than ever before .
having said this , even a good tool can always be improved .
the use of the recast technique meets the objective of better lawmaking .
unfortunately , the european union can hardly brag about its transparency .
i cannot understand how european union citizens can be outsiders .
we want increased transparency and citizens must be able to follow the democratic debate .
as regards sanctions , there is already existing legislation to be taken into account .
the agenda specified two minutes , but I am sure that you will have a further opportunity to speak .
we are speaking now about privacy in the era of the internet and not privacy as an abstract notion .
transparency and public access create a sense of participation and confidence in the political system .
commissioner wallström said that a good tool can always be improved .
we fight for data protection for our citizens , yet meps are to be expected to make everything public .
when we vote , everyone can look up how individual meps have voted .
all meps must also bear responsibility for the way they vote .
this is already in evidence as things stand .
we will clarify the final position of our group tonight .
the principles of democracy demand it .
i believe it is time that more attention was finally paid to this state of affairs .
i am therefore sorry that the commission gave no consideration to the rapporteur's 2006 proposal on transparency .
i rest my case .
the european parliament is being classed as the outside world , to which information is not provided .
this will also be a version for the age of the internet , as was mentioned in the debate .
is this post it note a document , for example ?
another fiercely discussed point is article 5 2 concerning access to member statesdocuments .
finally , I shall just comment on thespace to thinkunder article 4 3 .
i want rights enshrined in law which cannot be taken away not gifts , but rights .
written statements rule 142 
cooperation between the courts of the member states in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters
equal treatment and access for men and women in the performing arts 
i am also quite surprised !
at this time , we are still getting used to the recast rules .
you all have a note to that effect in the voting list .
this parliament has no right to introduce legislation .
its chance of influence is in amending legislation put before us .
it seems that , in the way we have interpreted the recast procedures , we have castrated ourselves .
after the vote 
this is enough .
the oral amendment was incorporated in the first of the four votes .
that is correct .
no .
i asked if there were any objections to the oral amendment .
before the vote on paragraph 31 
mr president , that will be very simple .
integrity of online gambling 
commission reports on competition policy 2006 and 2007 
small business act 
before the vote on paragraph 8 
voting time
on behalf of the alde group . mr president , I seek clarification .
the president is considering these two points .
de mr president , I congratulate the house on this new information system .
oral explanations of vote
it is for that reason that I voted against the report .
i have an additional point .
we have concerns in ireland about road safety issues .
better safety and more environmentally sensitive and sensible proposals are always welcome .
in that way , we can together establish a high standard at the european level .
regulations on soil protection have no cross border effect .
i therefore continue to believe that the member states can regulate soil protection themselves .
it must be rejected .
i cannot accept that .
perhaps a word of explanation is necessary concerning the correct actions of the president of the parliament .
that is very confusing for people who have to deal with this legislation .
i recently met with some producers in my constituency .
i give the example of the european fundamental rights agency , which is currently under investigation by olaf .
nl mr president , I voted against this report .
there is no doubt that integrity in the online gaming sector is extremely important .
however , this does not mean that we must turn to protectionism .
therefore , we must sayyesto integrity andnoto protectionism .
so I asked my pensioners .
these are not issues that the european parliament can underestimate .
this debate showed up many national differences , and there was no honesty in the debate at all .
there was one reasonable part , which was the part about fair return to guarantee integrity in sport .
mr president , we all know that gambling is a very emotive subject .
mr president , quality food is not an aspiration in europe it must continue as a reality .
mr president , thank you for giving me this opportunity to explain how I voted .
this is what it seems to have come down to .
we have 23 million smes in the european union .
they represent up to 99 % of all firms and provide work to more than 100 million eu citizens .
the fact that smes are usually considered more risky makes it difficult for them to get access to finance .
99.2 % of my region's businesses employ fewer than 49 people .
this initiative can curb unemployment and restart our economy .
it is really about big business , not about small businesses , and we should reflect that .
i should explain that being in a big group is not everything it seems .
it is that sort of attitude that we need to tackle .
written explanations of vote
i support mrs hennis plasschaert's report on the next steps in border management in the european union .
this view is shared by the european data protection supervisor .
the commission must manage the interconnection of these systems and expand their functionality in order to streamline costs .
creating the electronic system of travel authorisation is not justified financially .
we must also take into consideration the experience in the us in this area .
mr president , I supported giusto catani's report .
this is a joint responsibility .
i support mr catania's report on the future of the european common asylum system .
legends die hard .
thank you , mr president , I voted in favour of the report .
even the world of performing arts , as clearly highlighted by the commission , is not spared these problems .
we have therefore voted in favour of this report .
in writing . I believe that gender inequality should be phased out of our lives .
the european parliament must observe its past legislation and uphold the values of universal solidarity .
there is also the fact that working hours in the performing arts are long and non standard .
green drivingmeans reducing fuel consumption .
it was therefore decided to recast these directives and we have voted on them in parliament today .
minimum requirements .
resources would be better spent enforcing the directive in those member states which are non compliant .
poultry and manure and slurry .
on poultry , the ippc already controls 40 000 poultry places .
instalments .
i also voted in favour of flexibility for instalments
as the report states , this legislative process could have implications for 52 000 industrial plants in europe .
i therefore warmly support the commission's initiative and the rapporteur's suggestion .
the pronouncements by the european commission about limiting emissions of greenhouse gases are misleading and disorientating .
although the compromise is far better than the original proposal , we have not succeeded fully .
this afternoon , we voted on the statute for a european private company .
in the end , I voted against the proposal , for the following reasons .
no satisfactory answers are provided to such questions .
the basic idea of introducing a common european company form for private companies is a very good one .
however , it is not that proposal that we are to adopt a position on today .
i have therefore chosen to vote against it .
the process is not yet over .
the stipulation that a european private company really is active across borders .
at a time of a raging economic crisis , developing the sme sector is a highly desirable thing .
we have therefore chosen to vote against this report on the commission's budget for 20in this way , the real motivations prompting the european institutions to act are lost sight of .
in fact , perhaps they are the ones that are most in need of community institutional support .
experience shows that such a museum will be designed as propaganda for an increasingly federal eu .
central to the report is the safeguarding of the integrity of sports and sporting events .
in writing . I support a more open gaming environment in europe .
online gambling offers a new way for consumers to enjoy their gaming experience .
we must ensure that these people are safe from harm on line .
these systems should not be made uniform or merged into one .
allow me to congratulate my colleague , mrs petre , for this excellent report .
contrary to the claims made , production of real quality is at serious risk of disappearing .
applying harmonised production and marketing standards to both small producers and agro industry is unacceptable .
that way , regulation and quality control for agricultural products will become easier .
can anything that is not healthy to humans be described asfood?
in addition , the union must ensure a level playing field between locally produced and third country products .
in particular , they failed to evaluate the abuses of purchasing power which may follow from such concentration .
this report has finally found a route to agree between ourselves in the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
ms herczog's report recognises the work done by the commission and calls for further steps in this direction .
these elements make it impossible for ukip to support this proposal .
the global financial crisis and slow economic growth are having a negative impact on the level of entrepreneurship .
this fosters obvious inequalities in terms of competitiveness .
this would put european smes on a par with their counterparts in the rest of the world .
this is neoliberalism in its most visible form .
however , I have some comments to make .
support for smes must be a top priority , particularly in this period of serious economic crisis .
if the big companies fold , the little ones will inevitably follow .
these are decisive , especially when they have to pay back loans at a time of economic stagnation .
i can tell you right now that most of my concerns have been dispelled .
this advance was due to mr costa's efforts until the very last second .
this change has enabled us to reach a solution , albeit a minimal one .
this measure targets hulks .
parliament played its part back then .
the ais is also there for the benefit of fishing vessels , improving safety for these vessels , too .
we have also tightened up the arrangement for the accommodation of ships in distress .
the establishment of these rules was absolutely not an end in itself .
other regulations among the topics recently discussed in the european parliament unify the minimum requirements for crew training .
this includes the establishment of fixed deadlines for commencing and completing investigations and a structure for the final reports .
unfortunately , the incidents that set the process in motion made it clear .
this ensures that the whole sector and the whole framework of maritime safety have today taken a step forward .
after all , my colleagues and I have had the honour and the opportunity to tackle more specific problems .
however , the reality of the situation , so to speak , required that the scope be partially reduced .
we set , however , a rather long period to ensure that voyages in domestic waters are also covered .
it is better , however , that they are there , rather than not having changed anything .
i would like to thank mr tajani and the commission .
at the time of first reading , parliament adopted some amendments .
at that time , we reached political agreements on six of the eight proposals .
it is important to highlight the ratification of international conventions using the national method in this process .
they are capable of sending out a message to defend the rights of passengers .
they are capable of sending out a message to protect companies and ensure the rules are respected .
that is something we should say in the election campaign , too .
let me make two more points , however .
we should be fighting together to achieve that .
mr president , I have just had a real race to get to the chamber .
this was not heeded .
how democratic is that ?
whatever happened to the comments made here this very morning that this is an amending house ?
i am pleased at that . however , this parliament's term is coming to an end .
there is already a great deal of experience with this in aviation .
the rapporteur has done an excellent job in this regard .
what we have now is more transparency and stricter inspections .
the president cut off the speaker 
for me , the significance of this package will be felt for many years to come .
will the agency be able to cooperate effectively with the commission in ensuring the enforcement of these rules ?
that will ensure that the decisions made are rigorous , right and fair .
if we can do that , we will have helped to safeguard our maritime heritage .
we shall keep an eye on you , and shall support you again if further proposals are needed .
we could say much more , but there would not be much point .
i also think it would be good for the commission to report to parliament on this subject in 20i also thank everyone for your comments and contributions .
the debate is closed .
furthermore , no one can say what rescue operations were carried out after the emergency signal was received .
the investigation into the reasons and consequences of this accident has reached a dead end at the moment .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports 
this should bring us one step closer to a more sustainable transport system .
such revenue must be reinvested in the transport system with the aim of keeping external costs down .
fourthly , there must be the possibility of further action in future .
you know , it is the same story with the eurovignette .
mr vice president , congestion is caused by an insufficient provision of infrastructure by the member states .
no , you are the commission !
hence my puzzlement .
we will , of course , be pleased to hear your suggestions on this matter .
the costs incurred by traffic congestion are rising to 1 % of gdp .
the internal market is important , and so it is also important that agreements be made between member states .
the government has created a dense network of ever wider motorways .
many goods are now transported over long distances , sometimes even at various stages of the production process .
this encourages even more transport and increases the environmental impact still further .
decisions taken on this in 2006 have yielded insufficient results .
this is essential to my support for the eurovignette directive .
in addition , this proposal must not remain isolated .
the member states , as the shapers of their own specific conditions , must also have their place .
design should take precedence here , not bans .
there are a number of points that need to be made in this debate .
however , as a first stage , I think that this compromise deserves support .
this report is a serious attempt to deliver what parliament has called for over many years .
we should not forget the reason why this process has dragged on for so long .
at least three factors are simultaneously at play .
ga mr president , I would like to say that I understand the reasons behind this report .
the commissioner said that mountain regions are opposing the single market .
they are hit while going to the market .
everyone essentially agrees to the principle of paying the true costs .
he has achieved a workable compromise under really difficult conditions .
however , there is still one fly in the ointment , as I see it .
i hope that we will receive the necessary majority to achieve that breakthrough .
it is particularly important that we do not lose sight of that fact certainly not at this time .
transport has always been the lifeblood of the whole economy .
that is unfair competition .
that is why we need this directive .
then they will be credible .
we are also impugning other measures taken to promote the economic , social and territorial cohesion of the union .
it should not be for the eu to dictate aone size fits allapproach in this area .
pl mr. president , I would like to thank our rapporteur , mr el khadraoui .
he has dealt with hundreds of comments .
the hauliers have cited huge financial burdens , particularly those of tax on fuels .
i believe that both the european commission and governments should enter into dialogue with professional road hauliers .
we need to achieve cost reality here to really bring about a situation where market economic instruments regulate traffic .
otherwise , we will always have imbalances in this regard .
if peripheral regions decide not to take that route , that is something I can understand .
i should mention that specific legislative instruments such as these are actually necessary in member states such as romania .
this directive , however , has absolutely nothing to do with that .
all this discussion therefore highlights the difficulty of the issue , but also its importance .
the argument is therefore certainly thorny and complicated .
noise would add 1.1 euro cents to this .
let us simply go for a position we support 100 % .
my group is in favour of the internalisation of external costs , and specifically exhaust emissions and noise .
we believe this is reasonable .
that is not on .
thank you very much .
question time commission 
the next item is question time b6 0009 / 2009 which , exceptionally , will last until 8 p.m.
the following questions have been submitted to the commission .
a sustainable energy financing initiative is being developed jointly by the commission and the european investment bank .
i also think that a fund for energy efficiency and renewable energy would be important .
the ecofin today came to a compromise .
subject more flexible interpretation of the stability and growth pact
de mr president , commissioner , I have two brief questions .
my second question is as follows .
should this question not be linked to a certain level of success ?
i thought it was the questioner who had a supplementary , plus two other members .
secondly , what time does question time continue until tonight as we started late ?
we began late and we will finish late .
the commissioner must know a little bit about tax havens , because luxembourg rather falls into that category .
these are her words a resolute policy against tax evasion.
subject the internet and hate crimes
this includes prohibition of incitement to hatred based on race , sex , religion or nationality.
this year , it will present a recommendation on media literacy .
i myself have tried , with the safer internet programme , to do something else in this respect .
now to the murder question which the honourable member underlined .
subject information and communication technologies ict and information society
the commission has also set up a consumer market scoreboard that permits monitoring of market outcomes for consumers .
the evidence on the scoreboard helps us to better take account of consumer interests .
you can see a lot of the work they do .
however , I want to ask you what you are doing to develop online services .
i am referring in this case to the public key infrastructure .
is the commission able to do anything about this ?
member of the commission . first of all , the internet and the elections .
has the commission raised this and , if so , what action is it taking ?
questions nos 37 and 40 will receive answers in writing .
i would like to thank the commissioner for her reply .
i could have printed that off from the internet myself .
therefore , as I have said , let us not speculate on hypothetical situations in the future .
de mr president , I would like to support mrs ludford's question .
what he has not said , is whether or not serbia fulfils this criterion .
does serbia fulfil the criterion of full cooperation ?
subject opening of theenergychapter in the accession negotiations with turkey
initiating negotiations in the energy sector would make a decisive contribution to attaining this objective .
thank you for giving me the opportunity to answer them together .
i do not underestimate the difficulties in the dairy sector .
i think it is decades since we experienced a situation like the one we are seeing today .
farmers cannot continue to produce milk under the current conditions .
and yet time is the one thing we do not have .
i also sometimes have to remind some farmers that this compensation has already taken place .
as a result , there are many different labelling techniques in operation within the eu for sheep products .
it is important .
i am happy with all the comments that we have already had on the green paper .
would the commission consider granting a further deferral or removing the compulsory nature of this proposal ?
that concludes question time .
the sitting was suspended at 8.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. 
childcare facilities barcelona objectives debate 
the next item is the commission statement on childcare facilities barcelona objectives .
the aim is to offer this option to parents who want it .
a lot of work remains to be done , especially concerning children under three years old .
it encourages the member states to make full use of the possibilities offered by the structural funds .
on behalf of the ppe de group . commissioner , thank you for your statement .
in this way , we can also ensure well prepared and competent labour forces .
for citizens throughout europe , the subject of children is right at the top of their priorities .
in parliament , the subject of children is spread across all the committees .
thank you ever so much .
we need to press the reset button when it comes to matters of integration and start again from scratch .
yet , commissioner špidla , you have said that there are funding opportunities .
i have , I am afraid to say , heard no answer from you today on that question .
what else will the commission do to encourage the member states ?
you have also hinted that there are possibilities of co financing .
i would ask that you answer this question .
the care a child receives in the earliest years will have an impact on him or her throughout life .
women have been a wonderful addition to the workforce .
children are our future .
for better or for worse , we are shaping europe's future by how we raise our children .
i would ask the commission to view this issue for a moment from a child's point of view .
the situation with childcare in slovakia is rather complicated .
yet women have the same right as men to professional fulfilment .
how , then , can we talk about making it easy for women to return to work ?
however , we must look at the services being supplied , because quality costs money .
in addition , the number of single parent families is on the rise .
in some countries , almost a third of children are not born in the traditional family set up .
many of them live in poor families without any proper provision for food , healthcare and education .
it is the question of which social model we wish to promote .
i would like to ask you to read a bit of european history as well .
in this case , I recommend the following actions 
1. increase the involvement of national governments in this problem ,
many have spoken about the economic crisis .
this is not a time to dismiss childcare but to increase quality , affordable childcare for all .
we need , like never before , to invest in our children .
childcare helps families and society as a whole , and it can help the most vulnerable children too .
things have gradually improved , with the adoption of qualitative methodologies resulting from care staff receiving specialist training .
they have inferiority complexes in relation to those children who have grown up in a normal family .
it all sounds so logical and modern , socialist , even .
in this area , there is no progress or revolutionary change .
nobody wants to send women into the home .
in the new perspective , it is explicitly possible for the first time .
the present recession proves that disturbances in the financial market have noticeable negative side effects on the real economy .
children of immigrants debate 
member states must reinforce preventative measures and focus on the most vulnerable families .
we know that the parents of children from member states working in any other country receive child benefit .
i think that raising awareness among the parents who come to our countries to work is also our affair .
if one part of the body hurts , the whole body hurts .
an impact assessment is an urgent and necessary requirement .
i believe that this situation could be improved through adopting the following measures 
these services should be accessible to every migrant worker segment .
ro I would like to highlight one thing .
i was recently the shadow for the ppe de group on the report on educating the children of migrants .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on thursday , 12 march 200although circumstances vary between individual member states , the employment situation in europe is generally deteriorating .
the level of unemployment in the eu could be around 10 % in 20i have to say that neither qimonda management nor employee representatives have approached the commission .
it is a company that uses cutting edge technology , employs highly qualified workers and promotes research .
the portuguese government has already decided to make eur 100 million available for this purpose .
qimonda is not just any company !
during the last year , it received eur 325 million in subsidies , which proved to be inadequate .
the commissioner was right .
there is not much time left , just a few days .
top management figures are already drifting away .
that cannot , I would contend , be in the interests of the european union .
the portuguese government has been doing everything that it considers appropriate and useful to help resolve the situation .
saving the plants in munich will have a decisive impact on those in vila do conde and dresden .
time is short !
mr president , I commend the priority given to this debate .
the ball is firmly in national governmentscourts to apply for this funding .
furthermore , the derogations to minimum size are adjusted .
in the mediterranean , the artisanal coastal fishery now benefits from a derogation .
i think they will be successful .
if we want to save this species , we have to learn more about it .
mr president , the time has come to speak clearly .
i am not talking about a decade here , but five years at most .
this is particularly common in the mediterranean as recent journalistic investigations have revealed in the tv and press .
this time scale is very tight and I fear that there will be problems .
when issuing the new regulations , iccat must take into account this diversity of fishing systems .
not respecting the new recovery plan will have serious consequences and will lead to a collapse of the stock .
if not , however , then next year we will have to speak another language .
the vote will take place on thursday , 12 march 2009 at 12 noon .
agenda for next sitting see minutes
closure of the sitting
opening of the sitting
this barbaric act of terrorism has once again torn a family apart and brought with it unimaginable suffering .
these acts of terrorism shock us all .
terrorism represents one of the greatest dangers to the security , stability and democratic values of the international community .
the european parliament plays an active role in combating terrorism and in supporting the victims of terrorist attacks .
we would like to express our solidarity with them .
applause 
i know that there are some celebrations in madrid today , but little else .
however , the purpose of today's meeting is to discuss the upcoming european council .
we also need to do more to improve the regulation and supervision of financial institutions .
two thirds of european banksassets are held in only 44 multinational groups .
as you are well aware , member statesbudget deficits are growing fast right now .
of course , deficits inevitably swell in times of economic recession .
automatic stabilisers can , to some extent , play a positive role .
the european council will assess the state of implementation of this programme .
this issue will also be the focus of the special summit which will take place in early may .
let me be clear on one point we will not protect jobs by creating barriers to foreign competition .
we cannot afford it to fail .
the commission has provided some very useful elements in its second strategic energy review .
it means taking adequate measures to improve energy efficiency .
we must create a fully fledged internal market for electricity and gas .
next week's meeting will also discuss the preparations for the copenhagen conference on climate change .
the partnership includes a bilateral dimension which is adapted to each partner country .
the multilateral track will provide a framework in which common challenges can be addressed .
you will appreciate from this presentation that next week's european council has many substantial issues to address .
mr president , mr vondra , honourable members , we are living through testing times .
it destroys jobs and tests the resistance of our social models .
it also puts strong political pressure on all the leaders .
now is the time to move up a gear in our response to the crisis .
i am proud to note that the commission's preparatory work has met with such a favourable reception .
yes , we need immediate action to address immediate problems .
that is why we have set out a detailed calendar of new regulatory proposals .
just look at energy security .
this is central to what we are doing .
the money has to come , essentially , from national budgets .
the single market is the best possible platform for recovery .
this requires determination and imagination .
we will also carry more weight on the global stage .
they are based around the same principles .
europe today has to find its strength in cohesion , in coordination , in real practical solidarity .
bankruptcies are still occurring and unemployment is continuing to rise .
the european project is a political project , and a guarantor of peace , freedom and democracy .
we have been , and are currently , in a financial crisis that has turned into an economic crisis .
now the employment crisis is coming crashing in , with the prospect of social problems further down the road .
we have talked about lifelong learning .
now we come to the social consequences .
we must create opportunities for young people to find employment or further education or whatever it may be .
thank you , mr president , mr vondra and mr barroso .
the analysis of the mistakes made and experience gained must continue .
i will end by mentioning again that we need to see solidarity in action .
therefore , in the short term , we need to keep people in work .
it must not be a routine summit .
it is really wonderful and it all sounds excellent .
more must be done in the european council .
this means that companies are being threatened with closure .
three member states have implemented the resolution so far , which means that 24 states have not .
you must do more !
it is important for the commission to urge the member states to show solidarity .
amendment 92 will be the litmus test for you when we vote on it at midday .
let us see if you vote in favour of amendment 102 , in which we are demanding solidarity .
one final remark which is of crucial importance for our group relates to amendment 113 concerning tax havens .
this is a class war from above , which we at least do not want to be part of .
applause 
and their underlying message is this jobs , jobs , jobs .
nor should we accept heel dragging over the need to protect the planet .
so recession must not mean inaction .
the time has come for the fundamental reform that will provide jobs now and security in the future .
my view of this is slightly different to that of my fellow members .
we will not emerge from this crisis and there will be no real recovery .
the discussion on the links between climate policy , sustainability strategies and crisis management is just as inconsistent .
these economic recovery plans will not equip the european economy to face the future .
europe must take a different route .
a major problem confronting member states , including the czech republic , is company relocations .
de mr president , ladies and gentlemen , sometimes I do not believe what I hear .
finally , I would like to mention a number of areas of common interest .
we should not discuss this until we are blue in the face .
the citizens of europe expect us to act jointly in this crisis and not to oppose one another .
please do not paint too rosy a picture of europe . 
when you talk about automatic stabilisers , it is already in the prognosis .
how could you imagine respect for the european union ?
let us now avoid new economic demarcation lines between the new ones and the old ones .
we therefore urgently need a boost from europe .
mr daul is quite correct .
now is the time for us to show solidarity and innovation .
we therefore need innovation in two areas .
first , we should not squander these eur 5 billion on state aid .
we are therefore losing the battle when it comes to the next big thing in the economy .
in addition , it was this policy which was responsible for the crisis that we find ourselves in today .
what we need is exactly the opposite .
the low pay sector in europe must be reduced in size rather than continually being fostered .
i believe that social justice is now the only sensible economic policy .
it is the only way of bringing this disastrous crisis to an end .
could we have a better delivery ?
we need to stabilise the financial markets and reduce the risk of similar crises for the future .
it is not enough to do a lot but it is necessary to do enough .
this is what people in the street are waiting for from us .
the opportunities for these member states to use financial and fiscal instruments are limited , or completely non existent .
the posting directive should reinforce workersrights and not help to weaken them .
this is exactly the opposite to what the commission and the council are proposing .
after all , economic growth and low inflation provided scope for reform .
reform was necessary in the competition with up and coming economies and is , indeed , still needed .
only in this way can we avoid the costs of this crisis getting out of hand .
temporary support measures that meet the sustainability test can therefore be applied on a limited scale .
mr president , this debate is about jobs , and jobs and new prosperity .
i appreciate we can agree on that point .
i appreciate the consensus in parliament that your policy was wrong .
that is the way we can achieve more jobs .
the objectives of the lisbon strategy should not be put on ice .
it is now or never for europe .
pl mr president , a true strategy for economic recovery is essential for the european union .
today , that predatory procedure runs to tens of millions of euros and is ruining new member states .
the framework system is thus a good tool , the creation of which is a joint european success .
it needs to provide the appropriate resources currently , however , the recovery plan is not enough .
the structural funds should be used more actively and more in keeping with the situation .
member states should focus their attention on enabling the beneficiaries to control the funds .
this is one measure for combating the economic crisis which we can support unconditionally .
we must support this report unreservedly .
madam president , these three very extremely important reports have been drafted by socialist rapporteurs .
the role of the eib must be strengthened .
economic operators need prospects and legal stability .
the text on rating agencies must implement the lessons learned from the proven shortcomings .
europe also needs to be given a proper , effective , modern industrial policy .
let us have a recovery plan with substance and with action , and not just words .
the task is therefore great , and we must not err or procrastinate .
this is an enormous sum , and to use it properly is a great challenge .
further steps are to be taken at the spring 2009 european council in this regard.
there is , once again , a perceived lack of solidarity and a high degree of timidity .
for europe , today , that would be the equivalent of eur 400 billion per year over several years .
we have established the internal market , which has brought us much prosperity , together .
parliament should also play a guard dog role when it comes to the strength of the euro .
this should be an exception , though .
what is the cost of borrowing they would have to pay ?
it will also amount to genuine implementation of a policy of solidarity , and not protectionism .
we are all aware of this .
will you vote in favour ?
firstly , of course , the socialists are not responsible for the crisis .
we all know whose fault it is and this has been investigated in great detail .
the group will vote in favour of this .
i therefore support the many calls this morning for greater responsibility and more intensive cooperation .
martin schulz said that the issue isjobs , jobs and jobs and he is right .
we intend to address that issue at next week's meeting .
graham watson asked how much we will have to pay .
i think that is premature .
however , it would be premature to give an estimate now .
i am sorry for once to have to contradict mr juncker .
we must take the appropriate political measures in this respect .
this really is not about dividends for shareholders or bonuses for managers .
this transformation must continue during the crisis .
this means that we must help them to obtain funding .
however , what is parliament asking of the council ?
the european union is about competition , but it is also about cohesion and solidarity .
we cannot have a single market without this guarantee of solidarity and cohesion .
we do , of course , have governments of the centre and of the right in europe .
it is now that we need to do this .
we cannot wait until the summit in may .
the employment issues must be top of the agenda right now .
thank you , madam president .
the vote will take place today , wednesday 11 march .
written statements rule 142 
all member states , including malta , had to set out their strategies to deliver growth in jobs .
employment guidelines were set out .
it is precisely now that they want to see what the united europe is for .
indeed , solidarity is an absolute must to get through this crisis .
i represent romania in the european parliament , a country in south eastern europe .
certain parts of europe must not feel abandoned and helpless against a hostile situation which they have not provoked .
i totally concur with this statement .
in addition , measures to combat the crisis must be integrated as part of a responsible budgetary policy .
but how this is done does matter to the utmost .
pro cyclicality has to be averted both during an upswing and a downswing .
just cutting budget deficits drastically would not help much in this regard either .
the main features common to european union member states are democracy , stability , accountability and cohesion .
we are living in a period of economic uncertainty .
i find some of the language in kirilov's report in relation to the lisbon strategy regrettable .
countries which help banks financially are not eliminating the causes of the crisis .
the economic crisis has now reached europe .
in addition , they must enshrine the fundamental principle of the eu , namely the principle of solidarity .
it is necessary to create incentives to attract capital investment .
on the contrary , openness and the spirit of competition need to remain the basis of our activities .
in other words , the crisis should be seen as an incentive to implement the lisbon strategy .
it is obvious that state aid must be used prudently to avoid creating problems with competition .
firstly , the funding for energy infrastructure projects .
the commission also gave its first assessment of the results of the european economic stimulus package .
i congratulate the rapporteur on a very creditable report .
the emergence of tendencies is very worrying .
a crisis is also an opportunity .
we need to improve coordination and to abandon protectionism and all forms of demagoguery .
it is important that the eu should make conditions more flexible .
the third important matter is the supervisory mechanism the present bureaucracy is clearly unwieldy .
thank you for the report .
regional policy is the primary source of european investment in the real economy .
these measures must be supported by legislative proposals which also guarantee the financial allocations .
in other words we produce documents which we do not then implement .
vat exemption on the final importation of certain goods 
common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations recast 
investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector 
the liability of carriers of passengers by sea in the event of accidents 
civil liability and financial guarantees of shipowners 
the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures 
the commission takes note of the amendments voted by parliament that it will study in detail .
the commission confirms its willingness to seek a compromise with parliament and council .
i therefore ask for the house's support for a referral back to committee .
i will pass on this request , then , mr cashman , and the results will be made known .
facing oil challenges 
greening of transport and internalisation of external costs 
on the other hand , there is a request for a separate roll call vote on the original text .
before the vote on paragraph 20 
i want to change the wordfortofrom.
this is not contentious .
employment policy guidelines vote 
this is normally built into an amendment , but for some reason it got left out .
there is an indent that was worded as follows intensify the elimination of barriers.
until a few minutes ago , things looked quite different .
it is to your credit that you have encouraged the spread of social democracy .
this is good for the european parliament , which has moved to the left .
fr madam president , did he speak on behalf of the commission ?
because he wants to become a commissioner ?
as far as I know , the final vote has not been taken on the reul report .
can you confirm if this correct ?
pl madam president , imposing additional charges on heavy goods vehicles represents an increase in taxation .
i do not endorse the directive in its present form because it requires radical revision .
it improved greatly at parliament's reading , when we consider what the commission's original proposal was .
transparency must apply at each administrative level with regard to documents .
madam president , I am grateful for this opportunity to explain how I voted on this very important report .
were we able to debate these in an open and transparent manner ?
it I would like to thank those fans who have been tirelessly listening for so long .
i believe that my country should withdraw from the eu's social chapter .
that is the best thing that we could do to create more jobs in the economy .
however , at least this saves our taxpayers some of the unnecessary waste .
equal rights and opportunities must be provided to all citizens of europe , including the roma .
how is it possible that in a united europe , there are cases like this ?
madam president , I abstained on this report because I believe it simply does not go far enough .
this is unfortunate because there are some good proposals .
much more could have been done for the aviation sector , however .
then we might achieve this objective perhaps by 2020 or 20this mainly means that there has to be europe wide commitment to training and research very soon .
you may not have noticed , but we have made very little progress so far .
we are here for only three or four days per month .
they travel and cause carbon emission while they are getting here .
we are the worst hypocrites when it comes to this than any chamber I know .
madam president , have you noticed that the harmonisation of policy always happens in the same direction ?
i was also in support of the wide ranging remit given in this report to address the current crisis .
this is the test of sincerity for barack obama , for president sarkozy and for the other leaders .
i do wonder though whether , in this house , we know what the real economy is .
or is the real economy actually people doing jobs of work and innovating and starting their own businesses ?
however , things have changed now , and the money is running out .
pactio olisipiensis censenda est !
written explanations of vote
madam president , I voted in favour .
i believe that the environmental disaster that struck romania cannot go unheeded .
romania has emerged from the flooding exhausted , not only economically and environmentally , but also in social terms .
nonetheless , I fully endorse this tangible evidence of european solidarity .
this gesture is the eu's response to the request for assistance made by romania .
the application relates to five counties maramureş , suceava , botoşani , iaşi and neamţ .
on the other hand , it discharges its obligations as a flag state , in accordance with international conventions .
eight legislative texts making up a maritime package have just been adopted in the european parliament .
substandard vessels sailing under flags of convenience are slashing transport prices .
i agree with the objectives of the 3rd maritime package .
for these reasons , we abstained in the final vote on this report .
i agree with the objectives of the 3rd maritime package .
i therefore support the rapporteur's recommendation to approve the draft recommendation agreed with the council .
the eurovignette report contradicts these aims in the case of the peripheral member states of the european union .
in the final vote , I voted against adoption of the directive .
we should certainly seek ways to enable the use of more environmentally friendly vehicles on our roads .
we should not , however , use methods which are , in fact , another way of taxing enterprises .
during this time of financial crisis , it is kind of absurd .
this type of regulation shows that the eu is turning its back on its citizens .
i believe it is counterproductive to penalise someone who is stuck in congestion .
this is good news for the taxpayer .
at the moment , we are all still paying for the damage caused by air pollution .
traffic jams are a major contributor to air pollution , noise pollution and fuel waste .
madam president , I voted for the report .
for this reason I argued strongly in the past for the publication of parliamentary attendance .
what can we see ?
accordingly , documents on trade negotiations are deemed confidential .
ultimately , this is a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea .
we must rise to the challenges associated with the rise in unemployment and social exclusion .
it is remarkable that this report should admit several failures by the european union on social issues .
for this reason , I have voted against the report .
i voted against mr andersson's report .
it is , above all , a crisis of confidence .
this is not enough , however .
the roma community is europe's largest and most disadvantaged minority group .
i support this report because it suggests ways in which we can improve the situation of the roma community .
the huge growth in demand beyond the eu's borders alone will determine this .
investment is only possible when there is sufficient capital and there is a hope of some profit .
as such , I have voted against this report .
in a nutshell , this is the most important part of the preamble to the resolution .
however , this fact does not mean that all its underlying concepts need to be revised .
however , unless it speaks with one voice , this will result in loss of credibility .
limiting global average temperature increases is necessary not only in the developed world , but also in developing countries .
the eu has to provide a plan which will address relevant areas and sources of financing .
on the other hand , I cannot support several paragraphs of the report .
in writing . we must use the green economy to create jobs throughout the eu .
in writing . sv this resolution contains many deserving exhortations .
members insist that all financial aid must be timely , targeted and temporary .
the bail out of the banks was a necessary but not sufficient step .
data from the last few weeks do not engender optimism .
this is why the effective and rapid restoration of the award of credit must be ensured urgently .
several observations are called for , however .
we have to be aware of this .
there is already talk of increased taxes in the near future to keep public finances afloat .
the same can be said for the european commission .
it is counterproductive simply to increase demand in order to bring production back on song .
in writing . the financial crisis is the first test of globalisation .
surely it cannot be the intention to take short term measures that undermine long term objectives ?
madam president , I voted for the report .
for this reason I argued strongly in the past for the publication of parliamentary attendance .
the latter will have to be confirmed as a priority of cohesion policy after 20as a result , not surprisingly , the majority of parliament rejected our proposals , which 
i voted against mr kirilov's report on cohesion policy investing in the real economy .

state of play of sis ii debate 
the problem is therefore not technical , but political .
a number of operational difficulties have led to specific problems in getting sis ii up and running .
the final results of these operational system tests were only known in the second half of january 200this parliament has asked whether the problems identified to date will require the system to be rebuilt .
in concrete terms , the commission is coordinating a joint management structure for the project .
the broad outlines of the approach recommended by the commission for the continuation of sis ii were accepted .
we are therefore able to continue this feasibility study into an alternative solution .
this report is to be produced as soon as possible , and by no later than may 200for clarity's sake , this means that we will have a council decision at the start of june .
the problems with sis ii do not involve the infrastructure that it shares with vis .
the example of romania speaks for itself .
romania's external border is 2 000 km long .
i think they could be useful , and could produce the desired result significantly cheaper , faster and better .
i have participated in these debates from the very beginning .
i think it shows that there is a problem which needs to be fixed .
that is what we can do .
as regards the financial issues , I shall leave the floor to the commission to respond .
it is not a smokescreen , as has been suggested , to cover some political problems .
we were discussing this a year ago .
i shall limit myself to these few concluding remarks .
once again , I do , of course , undertake to keep parliament informed .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the council and the commission statements on 
your report rightly highlights the importance of reaching a settlement to the outstanding border dispute with slovenia .
it will assist croatia in taking the necessary steps to reach the final stage of the negotiations .
it is a condition for strengthening the rule of law and the proper implementation of the acquis .
this is an issue to which you have also drawn attention in your report .
we would like to take this opportunity to stress the strategic importance of turkey .
a comprehensive anti corruption strategy needs to be developed .
the ratification of the protocol to the convention against torture is vital .
it is a dynamic country with considerable potential .
we have taken note of the blueprint drawn up by the government of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia .
the internal cohesion of this multiethnic state is , of course , key to its future development .
let me start with croatia .
that was the message I took to both ljubljana and zagreb in january .
there are two equally important conclusions to this statement in the un charter .
first , the parties can choose any one of the methods outlined in the un charter .
i shall say a few words on cyprus .
i am also happy that agreements could be reached with workers in the shipping industry .
these reforms will be painful , but they are necessary and they can be made in a sensible form .
unfortunately that was not the case , but that is not what lies at the heart of this debate .
i would like to make one more general remark which also applies to macedonia .
there are bilateral problems , but they should not be allowed to block the negotiations on enlargement .
this is all about the negotiations between the european union and the individual countries .
this parliament must give a clear signal that both sides in all these disputes must be prepared to move .
this , too , has been included in the report .
public opinion in the existing member states is far less positive about this now .
criticism has been levelled at the police for failing to register complaints lodged by the public .
there is indignation about the demonstrative arrest of the mayor of the city of strumitsa and of other politicians .
firstly , turkey is not a european country , but forms part of asia minor .
thirdly , croatia has been ready to join the european union for a long time .
we cannot allow one country to join despite an unresolved issue and not the other .
on monday , your spokeswoman said that this could take place on the basis of international law and jurisprudence .
the president cut off the speaker 
i would refer to the national programme for reforms that has been set up by the present government .
i should like to mention a few points from this excellent report .
we hope that henceforth there will no longer be any reason for obstructing the subsequent accession talks .
that is how I understand the turkish statement on nabucco .
the temptation of blackmail is a bad counsellor .
in that respect , all credit to the rapporteur .
let them give back what they have stolen from our istrian and dalmatian refugees since 19then , and only then , can we talk about their accession .
this has not happened .
the main problem is the matter of the name .
there is a problem with the stabilisation of political institutions in macedonia .
in this respect , the forthcoming presidential and local elections in macedonia are very important .
the rule of law must also be guaranteed .
moreover , I would be grateful if we held it in brussels and not in strasbourg .
that shows how far behind we are .
turkey is asia , not europe .
we would lose credibility and the credibility of europe would be set back .
hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of people will migrate to countries like britain .
the way in which the problems in turkey are being minimised is starting to become impressive .
the balance sheet of more than three years of negotiations is positively lamentable .
let us therefore pull the plug .
the candidate country macedonia has also made huge progress .
cs I would like to make a few comments .
they deserve the opportunity to show their merit during the accession process .
we need to help them now and show that we have confidence in them .
turkey is not a european country , either geographically or culturally .
it is time for everyone to regain their freedom , independence and sovereignty , starting with cyprus .
these are major reforms .
i would like to see this happen as soon as possible .
thirdly , make progress on the cyprus question .
secondly , it must respect freedom of speech and thought .
there is a lack of civil and political supervision of the army , and this is simply unacceptable .
turkey has to deliver on long awaited reforms .
i think that joost lagendijk , rightly , said this .
mr posselt , the debate is closed .
i congratulate mrs oomen ruijten for this excellently drafted report .
enlargement is one of the great successes of the modern european union .
over the last year , we have seen significant progress and the intensive efforts of croatia in accession negotiations .
we would like to meet the growing demand for energy consumption from as many sources as possible .
to this end , the construction of the nabucco pipeline is of key importance .
nevertheless , hungary did not prevent romania from joining , because it considered european solidarity and tolerance more important .
i therefore consider it important for us to address the eu member states first of all 
no contract , no agreement , no society can be sustainable without justice .
a central element of that policy is cooperation with the icty .
firstly , the countries of the western balkans are part of the stabilisation and association process sap .
the next progress reports will be published in october 200these are updated on a regular basis .
these common positions are regularly extended and updated .
the european union will support the work of the icty until it has been completed .
i entirely agree that in the longer term , the legacy of the icty must be preserved .
we would not be credible if we did not hold firm to this .
i would like to make two points .
the socialist group has proposed two amendments to plenary .
that has led to confusion and a consistent postponement of deadlines .
the tribunal's work must be fully completed .
based on this assessment , the council should consider extending its mandate for as long as required .
rapporteur . madam president , I wish to thank everybody who contributed to this debate .
that has been a great pleasure .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday , 12 march 200written statements rule 142 
the greek communist party has abstained from the vote .
it refuses even by its presence to participate in the legitimisation of imperialist crimes by the european parliament .
question time council 
subject improvement of quality , availability and financing of long term care
president in office of the council . let me react to mrs harkin's question .
the presidency is fully aware of the importance of long term care in the context of an ageing population .
has any thought been given to a form of harmonised training , as these are new initiatives ?
the problem of ageing is one which we all share and we should approach this with some dignity .
the care provided by both informal and professional carers must be appreciated and organised by society .
subject unemployment in europe
president in office of the council . I should like to thank brian crowley for raising the question .
i agree with mr mitchell that we need a plan , yes , and we have some plans .
that is important in maintaining employment .
however , we must ensure that the required standards are not in conflict with the agreements mentioned above .
in a few years , the european union will ban the production of eggs from caged systems .
president in office of the council . I am not among the greatest defenders of the cap .
the czech presidency intends to pursue efforts at international level towards a successful agreement in copenhagen in december .
the forthcoming european council is also expected to agree key political messages .
climate change will be one of the topics discussed during the informal eu us summit in prague on 5 april .
now we will start its implementation , which involves a lot of technical work .
many of our younger constituents across the eu are telling our presidencies this very thing .
i do not have the papers with me so I will look carefully again .
we are ahead of the european spring council meeting and I would expect confirmation of all those ambitious goals .
yes , of course , we need to find common ground .
you are right that we can find a lot of synergies and there is no need to fight .
subject road safety
this is not surprising , as we are the country located right at the centre of the continent .
ro the eu has not done enough to reduce road accidents .
it is vital from the point of view of accidents , and particularly single vehicle accidents .
it is also and primarily the responsibility of the drivers behind the wheel .
we want to move the debate forward .
the next item is the green paper on the european workforce for health .
we need to reflect on the reasons why young people are not motivated to become health workers .
i also look forward to receiving contributions from the members of this parliament .
furthermore , an extension of imi to all regulated professions is envisaged .
the other half is why so many are leaving .
the key to this will be to find ways of recruiting and retaining healthcare professionals .
it is going to be tough but it can be comfortable as well .
perhaps , above all , we have to listen to the sharp end professionals .
we know from talking to midwives recently about the difficulty of getting professional indemnity insurance .
anyone you talk to will convince you that their system stands out .
you cannot have 27 different systems that are all the best all at the same time .
needless to say , a great deal of thought has gone into such a system in each country .
i can understand very well that this will meet with resistance .
there are plenty of reasons for more european involvement in the area of public health .
every year , alcohol abuse claims 195 000 lives and costs the european economy eur 125 billion .
there are also european trends , though , for example in the case of alcohol abuse among young people .
working in this sector demands a great deal from workers , and is often underpaid .
this is unheard of , of course .
it is therefore very important to regulate the principles of cross border medical care .
europe faces a number of challenges in sustaining and improving our healthcare services .
we cannot allow doctors to be on duty for too long .
i would also like to draw attention to the question of health promotion .
promoting a healthy lifestyle is a good prophylactic method which can prevent a variety of diseases and illnesses .
this shows that your contributions can be very helpful , because already some very important points have been made .
5th world water forum in istanbul , 16 22 march 2009 debate 
the un figures speak for themselves .
it has also improved water governance and management in acp countries .
the focus on the involvement of local actors has been one of the added values of this facility .
the eu will be represented at the ministerial segment of the world water forum by the current czech presidency .
member states are invited to participate with additional funding .
however , the problem is vast .
i have here with me a unicef brochure which dates from 200however , in the main , its statements still hold true and are striking .
that the sustainable production of food is directly linked to the efficient use of water.
it is the un that must be involved at the heart of matters concerning water .
appropriate finances will then , of course , be required .
unless this need is met , there is no point in talking about improving healthcare or developing education .
in other words , it hinders development and increases developmental inequalities .
a right is only bought in a society of slaves .
furthermore , is the state , or public ownership , the sole player in water policy ?
what does this phrase really mean ?
many , too many , people in the world are still denied their fundamental right to water .
the latest united nations report shows that , in fact , the situation seems to be getting worse .
all that is fundamentally important for this water forum .
the debate is closed .
the developing countries have committed to investing 15 % of their budgets in the framework of the abuja declaration .
nonetheless , budgetary support very much has the potential of meeting the shortcomings in southern healthcare systems .
thirdly , expertise must be enhanced .
this means , after an in depth discussion with the partner country , accepting the sectors proposed for support .
second alignment on national systems .
there is a wrong figure there , and it may well not be as bad as that figure suggests .
however , commissioner , I want to come back to the people .
what we do better will help people to be better , and then their economies could be better too .
child mortality in swaziland was 78 / 1000 in 1997 , compared to 86 / 1000 now .
in lesotho , life expectancy in the mid 90s was 60 , now only in kenya , more than 1 in 10 children die before the age of five .
end of quotation .
end of quotation .
that is why , commissioner , it is vital that we change the numbers in our health cooperation .
it is the issue of health conditions for the tuareg people in niger .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
implementation of the single euro payments area sepa debate 
when we drew up the accompanying legislation , the directive on payment services , we asked ourselves some questions .
we think it is undoubtedly time to do so .
the first question asks how the commission intends to promote and foster migration to sepa instruments .
the second question asks if a critical mass of payments will have migrated by the end of 20clearly we favour rapid migration to keep extra costs during migration to a minimum .
so the current pace of migration is too slow to attain critical mass migration by 20the third question was on the necessity of a clear and binding end date .
the fifth question related to how the commission is tackling the mif issue for card payments .
discussions with visa are ongoing as well .
payment services are a commercial activity .
lt at this difficult time , it is very important to find possible sources of economic growth .
parliament and the commission clearly share the same vision and the same goal for sepa .
therefore , we are asking in this resolution for there to be an actual ceasefire .
we are also asking if the european union can help to deliver desperately needed food and medicines .
we are no longer facing a crisis but what I think is already a humanitarian catastrophe .
this was confirmed to us by a wide range of independent sources , including the un and the icrc .
it is very important that the government follows up the most prominent high profile cases .
we certainly should not support a permanent ceasefire at this stage in case it allows the tigers to regroup .
then I turn my attention to amendments 3 , 4 and he saysi wish to bring to your urgent attention the civilian deaths in sri lanka .
i doubt that anyone would suggest that this is fabricated .
his words are reflected in my amendment and it is right that we should be concerned about these camps .
i therefore genuinely call upon you , please , to act wisely .
tamil people are people who own land .
therefore , they want to return to their land .
they are sri lankan .
that is why parliament passed its urgent resolution on sri lanka less than three weeks ago .
just imagine a member state of the eu in which terror has reigned for 25 years .
obviously civilians in this war zone are exposed to barrage fire from both sides .
i think we should prepare for post war order .
we have to revert back to peace mediation without winners or losers .
our focus must be on the people themselves .
i also hope that they do not have a specific segment of the electorate in mind .
it is not circumstantial .
ladies and gentlemen , I strictly applied the rules of procedure .

they also need reinforced help to consolidate their democratic institutions , statehood and rule of law .
we should not hold back our criticism with regard to internal developments in russia .
the first task is undoubtedly to convert the existing cooperation agreements into association agreements .
the goal is to establish a free trade zone with free trade agreements and gradually to abolish visa requirements .
the eastern partnership must also be open to belarus , but only once the conditions have been fulfilled .
if we dash these hopes again , we will be limiting our influence in the east in every respect .
if that happens , remember not to grumble about moscow's policies .
regarding funding , properly addressed , it will have to be in the next financial perspective .
thank you .
mr president , the eastern partnership is a project which covers six countries .
belarus has little in common with , say , georgia .
could the eastern partnership stand in for a black sea strategy ?
in other words , we are dealing with a common neighbourhood .
this makes that neighbourhood an area of conflicting interests and rivalry .
otherwise we will not achieve security and stability there , but the opposite .
when we were in minsk we obviously met the democratic opposition leaders and we also spoke with the press .
commissioner , in your speech which I was present for you talked about people to people contact .
young people , who are aware and educated , are the future of our continent .
external energy security policy is vital .
we know perfectly well the effect of this membership on russia .
the problem showed itself in fact when the new countries gained accession .
mr president , catch the eye is a good opportunity for polemics .
it gives support for both political and economic reform .
we are going into greater depth the association agreements are already very broad and deep .
we have to be patient with this very important policy , which we must continually try to develop .
i would say to mr szent iványi that we support the eastern partners in meeting our conditions .
i have always been in favour of that .
these are the major issues , on which all of you have made very valuable points .
we have to bring that together .
is there any news as to whether or not he will arrive during the debate ?
europe should decidedly continue supporting them .
this effort can bring tangible political and economic benefits .
based on our european experience , however , that will be more difficult if there is no integration .
the strategic partnership must be substantial in scope and of a gradual nature .
it is also true that brazil is very important to cooperation in relation to the wto .
naturally , mexico is also a partner that shares the same values and the same interests .
we must absolutely , therefore , help mexico .
we would like to complete the negotiations on two major aspects .
it is especially important to us that we strengthen the free trade agreement once again .
in addition , we share principles and values that are also a result of our christian heritage .
i hope such a summit may be held with mexico this year .
mexico and brazil are also playing an increasingly important role on the world stage .
however , this strategic partnership cannot avoid certain immovable points .
we are going to abstain on this report as well , for a number of reasons .
firstly , we believe that the report ignores negative consequences in economic terms .
it is a chance to call another summit and then things remain largely as they were .
the union is choosing the wrong priorities here .
there is a call for us to work together for the smooth conclusion of the doha round .
the subject of market access is a salient issue for both camps .
i have also looked at the draft recommendation from the perspective of my geopolitical interest .
that would mean an automatic cultural visa .
ro I wish to express my support for mr salafranca's report .
it promotes free competition in the area of air services .
however , this adds another dimension in the broad field of the external value of multilingualism .
it must be emphasised that europe regards mexico as an important partner for supplying raw materials .
the security of raw material supplies is specifically one of the key factors supporting europe's sustainable development .
i am therefore calling for the expansion of bilateral cooperation in the field of education and innovation as well .
thank you for your attention .
it is good that we are cooperating on a multilateral basis with this area .
however , it is important for us to achieve a balanced relationship between both partners in each case .
mexico was considered a shining example to be followed .
i applaud that decision and I think that we need to do this for every commodity .
i think it is very important to carry on with these special dialogues .
it has always gone in parallel with doha .
50th anniversary of the tibetan uprising and dialogue between the dalai lama and the chinese government debate 
there are two conflicting positions one of the parties is lying .
the eu can be decisive in the search for the truth .
as the radical party we propose satyagraha , the search for truth , as a collective global political initiative .
we need somehow to bring about the resumption of the sino tibetan dialogue .
the eu policy vis à vis china is one of engagement .
firstly , we support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of china , including tibet .
we have always said that this dialogue should address the participation of all tibetans in decision making .
in 1950 , communist forces invaded tibet , leading to the exile of the dalai lama 50 years ago .
we would certainly highlight the failure to allow free trade unions to operate within china .
we are concerned about the plight of religious and ethnic minorities across the whole of china .
at one time , the chinese authorities paid heed to our resolutions , but no more .
the dalai lama was here only in december , speaking on behalf of tibet in the plenary .
why is it necessary to revisit the issue again ?
schools suffered arson attacks and hospitals and mosques of the muslim minority were attacked .
the problem is it is beginning to be resented elsewhere within china .
protests 
but the problem is , to quote the beatles money can't buy you love.
tibetans still want a degree of cultural and political autonomy far beyond that which china is prepared to grant .
he will be 20 this year .
silence in the media .
his call for dialogue has had no positive response in beijing .
this is the bitter reality .
the isolation of tibet must stop for the inhabitants , for tourists , for journalists .
in the run up to the games , china gave foreign journalists some space .
sadly , it was short lived .
all the media have to submit to the censorship diktats of the parties .
this is a necessary step in order to get the dialogue between china and tibet going again .
we do not want dialogue , we want negotiations .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
written statements rule 142 
great countries and great nations should be magnanimous .

eu brazil strategic partnership 
i expressed the thanks of the european parliament at length on your behalf at the reception two days ago .
loud applause 
the next item is voting time .
oral explanations of vote
we can resolve disputes by listening carefully to all of the parties involved .
bg thank you , mr president .
i supported the turkey progress report .
thank you .
sk we know what a testing time our friends in the balkans have had .
this is modern turkey , governed by a fundamentalist , islamist party .
these are its values and we think that they are not appropriate for europe .
never has this saying been more appropriate than in the lamentable saga of the accession negotiations with turkey .
now , in reality , that is not the problem .
this accession procedure must be abandoned .
mr president , this report sets out turkey's progress towards eventual membership of the eu .
however , I do have some concerns about turkey's progress towards membership .
greece's stubborn obstruction of the start of negotiations for accession is beyond comprehension .
the naming of the country must not be an obstacle !
yet it is time that this parliament listened , for once , to those it is supposed to represent .
mr president , I was very pleased with the vote today .
i am not in favour of mr milošević he was a baleful and wicked communist .
mr president , I voted in favour of this resolution and report , but I have some concerns .
i reiterate the issue around food production standards , which are higher in the european union .
explanations of vote continuation 
four priority areas were identified where progress is essential namely
open recruitment and portability of grants ,
training and skills of researchers 
these areas deal with mobility , transparency , publicity and support to researchers and potential researchers .
for some , this might mean having access to resources beyond the borders of their country of origin .
these arrangements also encompass phd students , who carry out the lion's share of research activities .
women continue to be under represented in most areas of science and technology and in positions of responsibility .
it is essential to make the selection and promotion processes open and transparent .
mr president , I voted in favour .
new technologies have now transformed our lives , and leisure activities are by no means excluded from this process .
lectures from eu institutions have almost the opposite effect .
it is therefore our duty to protect consumers , especially children .
for this reason , we must pay particular attention to the pegi system for rating games .
children imitate the games which can lead to tragic results .
last tuesday was a fairly typical day at the gaza crossings .
in writing . I voted against this report which seeks to establish a common aviation area with israel .
it would be superfluous for me to repeat here the reasons that led to my vote of approval .
it further condemns the attacks on civilians as documented by the international crisis group .
what purpose does it serve in finding a long term solution ?
peace talks must involve all parties .
under all circumstances such a treaty must deliver a self governing tamil region in the north east of the country .
last night , mr tannock and mr van orden argued for the complete opposite .
soil deterioration is a problem which cannot be ignored .
however , these are short term actions .
we still believe that these problems can be overcome by breaking with these agricultural policies .
i have voted against this report .
i therefore support this resolution .
this proves that immigration is a human drama which creates inhuman situations .
the problem of immigration will not be solved like this .
i have therefore voted against this resolution .
however , I would like to emphasise that it is not enough to make a commitment in this respect .
then , and only then , will we be able to discuss croatia's accession to the european union .
i voted in favour of the motion for a european parliament resolution on turkey's progress report 200the report unfortunately comprises both serious lacks and misdirected demands .
the armenian genocide is not mentioned at all , which differentiates this report from earlier resolutions from parliament .
mrs oomen ruijten's report is much too weak in this regard .
for that reason , we are sad to say that we feel we must voteno.
paragraph 45 of mrs oomen ruijten's report contends that the eu's accession negotiations with turkey should be expanded .
we sincerely believe that the eu has a tremendous potential to effect change .
this is especially evident in the current behaviour of the turkish government towards the doğan media group .
religious minorities continue to be discriminated against and harassed .
there is no macedonian ethnic minority .
these provide for the halving by 2015 of the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water .
not even water can escape the privatising and liberalising zeal of the majority of the european parliament .
i voted against this resolution in the final vote .
sustainable development cannot be imagined without the protection and proper management of the vital resource of water .
yet even in developed countries we are seeing serious water shortages .
the international community must take access to water much more seriously before it is too late .
access to clean water is a basic human right , so let us make it a major campaign .
i voted to adopt the resolution on an approach to health services in sub saharan africa .
often , the average life expectancy in individual countries is similar to that in medieval europe .
there is nothing more human and , at the same time , european .
it is therefore important to be able to experiment with new forms of aid .
our own country , sweden , is currently looking for new and interesting paths .
we could not support this resolution in the final vote because these amendments were accepted .
i voted in favour of this report .
this is proven by the various political agreements throughout history to the present day .
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
are there any comments ?
i would like to speak on the subject of china .
we must therefore impress upon the government of guinea bissau that those responsible must be found .
this is therefore also essential for our own european security .
the state's inhabitants live in chaos and there is a shortage of water , medicine and schools .
although the elections held in 2008 were peaceful , an initial assassination attempt took place shortly afterwards .
at the same time , a cocaine smuggling route passes through the country .
i would like also to send condolences to their families .
there should be no impunity .
the debate is closed .
this is therefore an issue that is of central importance for the european union .
they are often held together by force , and the army's power is great .
they get the chance to behave badly by providing the rulers of these countries with privileges and wealth .
abuses of this nature bring into being counter movements .
opposition members freed by court order are then locked up again by the state , regardless .
the resolution rightly calls for greater efforts in respect of mediation , compromises and peaceful solutions .
in the philippines , both the moro islamic liberation front and communist partisans are active .
the kidnappings continue .
expulsions of ngos from darfur
a few people still argue that what has happened in darfur is not genocide .
of course , if bashir refuses , then he should be prosecuted with the full force of international law .
the united nations has said that kicking out the humanitarian groups puts more than one million lives at risk .
in the western region of darfur , the government seeks to prevent such a secession by all means .
in that region there has always been a conflict of interests between nomadic herdsmen and settled farmers .
in this dirty work , the government can do without foreign observers , aid workers and mediators .
the population has been affected by one of the most serious humanitarian crises in the world .
the court accuses him of authorising genocide , murder and displacements , as well as tolerating torture and rape .
a war against the people of southern sudan has been going on there for decades .
this is a humanitarian disaster brought about by the genocidal policy of mr al bashir .
witnesses have reported cases of diarrhoea in the zam zam camp and cases of meningitis in the kalma camp .
omar al bashir's decision to expel charitable organisations from darfur will result in further crimes .
madam president , one of the greatest human tragedies in the contemporary world is taking place in darfur .
that is not impunity impunity is to continue as you are for many years .
according to the un , almost 5 million sudanese people currently need urgent aid .
we must not therefore give in to this blackmail .
it is clear that we need an international coalition to put pressure on president al bashir to abandon this position .
i would , however , like to put a question to the commissioner .
we are aware of the african union's position on the al bashir case .
it appears that there are double standards here .
author . madam president , I have two oral amendments .
one is on recital b and the other is on paragraph concerning paragraph 4 the amendment is in two parts .

i think that this invitation should never have taken place .
the system in ireland is as strong , or as weak , as that eu framework .
as we all know , the regulatory system has failed globally .
the president cut off the speaker 
in intergroups , meps can unite across the political divide to deal with particular issues .
this is being carried out by every single political group , apart from the patriotic attack party .
mr president , in january the commission attacked the hungarian moratorium on genetically modified maize mon8the moratorium is clearly supported by the whole hungarian scientific community , all political parties and hungarian society .
fr mr president , one of our fellow members has just spoken about the issue of intergroups .
do not allow more or less secret sub groups to meet during the next parliamentary term .
pl mr president , there is no denying the demographic crisis taking place in europe .
in any case , it is unacceptable .
following the company's insolvency application , they are waiting until 30 march for a solution .
can I please underpin the comments already made by a few colleagues about the importance of intergroups ?
when a major accident happens , those who live along the coast pay the consequences .
we know the risks that these ships bring in areas such as this .
he committed murder and plunged many people , including his own family , into grief and despair .
his family too have lost a child and their world too has been turned upside down .
are we doing enough to protect ourselves and our children ?
if we want safe food , because only safe foods can and should be european foods 
if we want food adequacy , because only thus will we be able to deal with crises 
it is worth taking note of this resolution .
i need hardly say that neither power plant will be using ccs .
i hope the european union will give neither political nor material support to this .
ladies and gentlemen , to whom does the revoz car production plant in novo mesto belong ?
the russians have now deferred these important talks indefinitely .
the european union's energy independence and member statessolidarity in this matter are more necessary than ever .
this is exactly why it is more important now than ever for us to stand united .
we must take a stance against anti european discourse , against ultra nationalist elements which are destructive and dangerous .
thank you .
we commemorate the event every march , and the presidents of two other countries did so as well .
they did not necessarily aim to get the best development outcome .
the third assurance I want is on the most favoured nation mfn status .
we only have the choice of voting yes or no .
what kind of problems have come to our attention during the course of the negotiations ?
first of all , it seems rather questionable as to whether the timeframe was sufficient .
of course , the commission is in a good position .
it was able to lead the negotiations , call a vote and involve the member states .
exports from the acp countries will only make up a small percentage of its imports .
the increasing food prices in the acp countries are the undeniable proof of this effect .
finally , there are also questions regarding mode if goods are to move freely , should people not be allowed to do so , too ?
i have now been chairman of the committee for international trade for two and a half years .
the collaboration was successful and I think we have achieved a great deal .
thank you very much .
this is essentially what the interim agreements are all about .
the economic partnership agreements seek to guarantee continued trade and development in some of the world's poorest countries .
i do not believe that there is an inherent conflict between trade and development as some speakers claim .
quite the contrary trade leads to development , duties lead to poverty .
in these times of uncertainty , the world needs more trade , not less .
trade can provide an excellent contribution in this case .
why do we have to do this ?
no , the governments of the acp countries did not accept continuing negotiations under pressure or threats .
we want specific commitments and I would like to list them one by one .
the second fundamental subject for which we are awaiting a response concerns the singapore issues .
on this point , I want particularly to emphasise public procurement .
the third point is services .
we know that the loss of customs revenue will cause a reduction in the budgets of our partners .
the fourth point , and this has already been mentioned , is that food security must be protected .
is the commission prepared to propose similar measures in other regions ?
i have been delayed getting here and have managed to arrive at the last minute .
so we have to do that that it is the first thing .
developed and developing countries are facing an unprecedented financial and economic crisis which has gripped the entire world .
we should be very uneasy about this .
i am aware that other questions have been raised which commissioner ashton is ready to answer .
thirdly I would like to reassure parliament concerning the important matter of access to medicines .
special attention will be paid to strengthening the regional integration programmes and ensuring a sustainable future for them .
as an example we might mention here the comprehensive epa intended for the west african economies .
however , each region has its own specific characteristics which must be taken into account .
we must respond to the current crisis by establishing further partnerships and not by restricting them .
i believe that today's plenary session is an important step forward on economic partnership agreements epas .
one thing is clear all put acp development at the centre of epas .
in fact , we would rather seek to strengthen than limit acp rights and capacity in these areas .
these you will need to redress , I do apologise if I missed you saying that earlier on .
the assent procedure for cariforum states and côte d ivoire is crucial to realising the potential of these reforms .
approval of these signed agreements will allow for a formal negotiation procedure to progress .
this is something which I believe you have taken to heart and that you are working extremely hard on .
a few weeks ago , I attended the most recent regional acp summit in guyana .
the text contained in the sadc epa resolution presents a good compromise .
first of all , we have to recognise that there is only one full economic partnership agreement today .
secondly , on the trade front , as you have pointed out , we have historic ties .
we plunder everything there is and take all the riches .
it is essentially a legal requirement based on the rules of legality laid down by the world trade organisation .
if you do not believe me , take a look at your documents before you vote on wednesday .
you can also read about the right to establish funds for individual inhabitants .
these measures relate , for the most part , only to trade and competitiveness .
the ors are at the heart of aliving basin.
despite these concerns , we should welcome the assent of the inta committee for these epas .
that is very important for us .
the issue of bananas was raised .
there is also the issue of haiti .
we meet with ngos , we meet with smes .
it is a failure and I think that has been said already .
the agreements make provision for monitoring and reviews that will involve parliament .
i look forward with personal interest to your vote tomorrow .
we all know that it will help the development of these countries .
i was pleased that she also made commitments on most favoured nation status .
we would love to see monitoring .
that is the only way we can understand what you are going to negotiate .
this was the case regarding bananas and on cotton for other countries .
i know how complicated it is and I am very grateful that she is helping me in this matter .
here , too , I am satisfied that we have achieved a compromise which I can wholeheartedly support .
finally , mr president , there is something else we have to address , namely the product claims .
we also ought to examine them and bring them up to date .
i would also like to offer particular thanks to the commission , whose cooperation was extremely constructive and successful .
others would not .
i should just like to address a few points .
as I said , this regulation is also part of our simplification programme .
there are probably few people around who could really understand it .
that is why we have come up with a significant simplification of eu legislation .
the commission takes note of the concerns of member states on the recasting of directives into regulations .
yet , I find that the critics often tend to stop short .
and we have a directive turned into a regulation .
she wanted to support clear labelling of products about the content of nanomaterials .
we are making history with this vote .
until now , it had continually stressed that the existing legislation was sufficient to guarantee the safety of nanomaterials .
it was brought onto the market without sufficient explanation of the risks .
i also sincerely hope that we will finally have an open debate on the purpose and uses of nanotechnology .
in fact , we still do not know very much about it .
should we , then , allow an active substance in cosmetic products with absolutely no means of control ?
after all , developments in chemistry and in cosmetics itself have brought enormous and fundamental changes .
these can have both positive and negative effects on human health .
we have taken the first step with this regulation .
congratulations , commissioner .
sometimes the same substance works on me one day , but does not work the next .
da mr president , we all use cosmetic products .
we are happy that our prohibition on cmr substances has been retained , but made more appropriate .
however , the most important thing is that nanomaterials have at last been included .
it is as though the industry has tried to stifle the debate on the safety of nanomaterials .
this modern regulation at the same time reduces the administrative burden for european producers employing more than 350,000 people .
i do not agree that messages about the content of nanomaterials in products should take the form of warnings .
i also welcome the fact that the directive will actually become a regulation and will have greater legal emphasis .
whereas the positive characteristics of nanomaterials are more or less familiar , the risks are largely uncharted .
no one has expressed a wish to take the floor .
as mr davies said , we have really provided a good example of what european legislation can achieve .
we have , indeed , succeeded in banning animal testing .
however , labelling allows consumers to choose .
the vote will take place tomorrow , tuesday , 24 march 200the placing of biocidal products on the market new biocides revision proposal debate 
the commission statement on the new proposal for a revision of the biocides directive .
this is why I would like to thank my colleagues who supported this compromise between the three institutions .
we cannot run the risk of losing important products because their registration has not been completed .
important areas now have to be urgently harmonised and regulated .
no one wants us to lose our high hygiene standards .
any carelessness on our part may have irrevocable consequences .
i would like to thank again my colleagues , the shadow rapporteurs , with whom we cooperated very well .
the first point is on the role of parliaments .
flexibility and pragmatism have therefore been necessary when apportioning the governance incentive fund .
this is also important from the point of view of demographic trends .
africa deserves our support , and not only for that reason .
i will now read it in english .
that is an important detail .
in this context , the fundamental aim of cooperation on development issues is to counteract past processes and mechanisms .
jomo kenyatta , the father of kenyan independence , described this in a vivid , albeit simplified , manner .
historically oriented policy is not , however , the only reason for europe's involvement in development related problems .
africa remains the poorest continent in the world .
that being the case , I hope that things will change in this regard .
we should continue with the efforts to involve those countries more intimately .
it is an organisation of politicians , who use it to participate in global political life .
africa is a continent with rich natural resources , which are used by the whole world .
let us remember how a peaceful kenya became drenched in blood within the space of a few days .
how can we ensure that financial aid from different countries is properly distributed ?
this is an issue we discussed a few months ago .
we also spoke about the steps china is taking .
perhaps china has found the right path ?
we should examine this path carefully .
let us work together to make these institutions more democratic .
in paragraph 46 she refers to african food security and food sovereignty .
such situations are really quite distressing .
furthermore , these investments do not provide any jobs .
secondly , I would like to thank the institutions involved .
both commissions have agreed , as have the two parliaments as well as the two councils .
i would like to comment on what mr hutchinson said .
back then , it would have been business as usual .
development and democratic governance in africa must form part of the crisis exit strategy for all of us .
however , not much progress was made in this field last year .
the leading global financial institutions are making the following predictions for 200the wto predicts a decrease in the value of global trade of as much as 9 % .
the second fact is that sub saharan africa is the poorest region on the planet .
let us take the fight against climate change as an example .
it is equally obvious that the role of the national parliaments and that of civil society are eminently important .
unfortunately , that is not yet the case .
we got an additional billion , however it was spread over three years instead of two .
i am therefore , naturally , entirely in agreement .
we do not intend to reopen dac issues .
i do not think that is the case .
it is not true to say that we are not contributing to the solution .
africa is no longer the exclusive territory of europe and that is very good .
it is indeed advisable to question the quality of the development policies set up between china and africa .
i am simply saying that a whole series of issues merit responses .
it is linked to ownership by civil society and by debate at parliamentary level .
i will come to parliament with that in april .
rapporteur . nl mr president , I actually do not have much more to add .
the commissioner has made the necessary remarks in that regard .
we will continue to follow this process .
what will the lifespan of such a project be and what will be the conditions for carrying it out ?
the report's conclusions are worrying .
these programmes were presented to and awarded by the member states last december .
collectively , these seven programmes represent approximately eur 1.8 billion .
the presentation is closed .
rapporteur . fi mr president , commissioner , subcontracting chains are commonplace in business .
common european problems have to be solved with common rules .
it will hold its first meeting on 25 march .
we therefore need to study its economic and legal repercussions in detail .
the presentation is closed .
worryingly , subcontracting may increasingly be used as a way of reducing direct social responsibility .
clearly , the enforcement of legal obligations becomes more difficult in long and complex chains of interconnected companies .
at the moment only eight member states have national legislation covering the responsibility of subcontracting undertakings .
it must be confusing for people to hear mr kamall speaking on a karim report .
the eu's trade in goods with india has more than doubled in value between 2000 and 200i want to stress that the fta must help 
achieve growing bilateral benefits for an ever increasing number of citizens
the eu is india's biggest foreign investor and trade partner .
india's investment in the eu has also risen , many times over , during the last few years .
food prices in europe short presentation 
the question we therefore have to deal with here today and in the future has two aspects 
the malfunctions in the supply chain and its practices are evidently putting terms of healthy competition at risk ,
i attach particular importance to this issue .
artistic studies in the european union short presentation 
this issue is occupying an increasingly important place at european level .
it is essential that it be promoted in europe's education systems from as early an age as possible .
innovation encourages the creation of synergies between traditional areas of activity and more innovative ones .
today we must combine technology and design , whilst integrating the principles of sustainability and economic viability .
this combination requires a redefinition of the ways in which knowledge is transmitted and acquired .
the debate is closed .
when I received the report , I began to read it with great enthusiasm .
we need to try somehow to communicate to them the idea of europe and the values of european unity .
my own idea was that there should be a unified , one year common european curriculum in history teaching .
i do not fully understand your desire to see ngos participate in the election campaign .
i very much welcome the report by mr hegyi entitledactive dialogue with citizens on europe.
the commission appreciates the unfailing support it receives from parliament .
for my part , I applaud your personal commitment as a member of the european parliament .
in writing . this is one of the most important issues which needs to be addressed .
the european population doesn't feel that they are european citizens .
most citizens do not feel part of the process and they view the european union as an institution apart .
gyula hegyi's report sheds light on an important contemporary problem .
we must make it possible for european citizens to have a more effective voice in shaping european union policies .
we need to ensure that appropriate information sources are made available in the less developed regions .
we need to know that decision making is in our hands .
the great unknown is always too easy a threat , and it is easy to join that particular chorus .
one reason is obvious the union has a very male face .
as we know , he always pays great attention to human rights issues and tragedies in africa .
the mass immigration that has taken place in recent years has brought this tragedy to eu countries .
i am going to turn my attention away from the text again for just a moment .
this is a debate that I myself have experienced in my own country in the past .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 24 march 200written statements rule 142 
i also highlight the importance of language as a factor of social inclusion .
i clearly recognise and respect these languages and at no point try to obstruct them .
i welcome your support for our approach .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 24 march 200written statements rule 142 
multilingualism must be a common denominator , not a factor of division for the european union .
we all know what they are , and opinions tend to agree from this point of view .
it can help achieve unity effectively in a world of diversity .
in this respect , we also insist on the need to preserve linguistic diversity in europe .
agenda for next sitting see minutes
documents received see minutes
no other part of the world has generated so much mutual cohesion .
it also adds a third component , namely that of territorial cohesion .
territorial cohesion also complements the existing policy of economic and social cohesion .
they come from all the member states .
i hope that we can continue to work together in this way in future .
applause 
cities generate more than 70 % of europe's vat .
cities and urban areas therefore need special attention within the framework of the cohesion policy .
i would like to emphasise two main ideas from the text of the report .
the first is the question of sub delegation , which means transferring control of european resources to cities .
this must change in the next programming period .
that is all for now .
but how should we approach these layers of society ?
here we need to distinguish between consumer credit and micro credit , for the two should not be confused .
your message is also clear on the need to strengthen the urban rural relationship .
i see this as a test case for territorial cohesion , which could then be extended to other macro regions .
we are working on this .
i share your view that we must continue to reform policy delivery .
however , there are certain considerations that we want to state .
the eu needs to do more by providing proper legal advice on setting up a business .
the need to strengthen small and medium sized enterprises and to link regional policy with industry and science 
firstly , the existence of geographical and demographic peculiarities in regions 
thirdly , the need to divide best practice criteria into mandatory and optional criteria and
cohesion is one of the most obvious successes of the european project .
spain has been a clear example of this , given the economic and social development that it has experienced .
mr van nistelrooij's report responds to the green paper on territorial cohesion published by the commission .
however , to date we lack a precise set of criteria to which we can refer .
we should take this into account when allocating funding .
it is a pity that we are discussing them all in one go .
the contribution of the european structural funds to environmental transformation is a future issue for territorial cohesion .
as a result , we must change course .
eu funds should not be used to promote programmes and projects which damage the climate .
you have not answered this question .
why do you remain silent on this subject ?
thirdly , so called territorial cohesion must contribute to economic and social cohesion .
fourthly , new objectives and priorities must be matched by new community financial resources .
sixthly , boosting the community budget in order to promote economic and social cohesion is absolutely essential .
i believe this must be active through the second pillar of the cap .
however , the rapporteur has successfully opened up a debate on this relevant topical issue .
madam president , I speak on the van nistelrooij report and to emphasise three points .
first , that territorial cohesion involves promoting polycentric development across the european union .
a higher degree of consistency requires transparency in relation to data and payments .
knowing how resources are distributed is an essential tool for highlighting and correcting distortions .
we are saying that we are facing a wall of silence .
therefore , it is logical for us to reject all attempts to renationalise the structural policy .
however much we value subsidiarity , european funds must be allocated on the basis of binding criteria .
we have already come to a consensus on this .
economic and social inequalities are constantly increasing 
regional development within capitalist frameworks cannot remove class conflicts in the system 
we can see that the share allocated to the french regions is continually shrinking .
however , I have the impression that in some cases both of these policies have identical objectives .
one more comment on financing in my opinion , modulation is not a nice word .
this discourages the beneficiaries and fuels criticism from the inspection bodies .
so then , the benefits cannot be denied .
mrs hübner , the commission holds the key to the effectiveness of these provisions and budgets .
the president cut off the speaker 
it is a debate about retreating from any kind of sector by sector treatment of european policy .
above all , I would like to emphasise once again what we found to be our most important points .
the eu budget must include a budget for these micro credits .
these micro credits are primarily granted at the local level .
for that reason it is very important that an activation policy be implemented at the local level .
i would like to single out two of these measures and reinforce them .
it is right that this period should now be reduced to three years .
the same criteria should not be applied to innovative projects as to other projects .
bg what are the basic objectives of the micro credit initiative ?
territorial cohesion is not meant to focus exclusively on regions suffering permanent handicaps .
to finish , I would of course like to thank all our rapporteurs .
ro I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for producing the regional development package .
europe's regions will develop in different ways unless they are coordinated via a single eu policy .
pl madam president , cohesion policy is the main pillar of the integration process .
it is particularly important that we coordinate and properly plan support for rural areas .
there is also a significant disparity among these areas in individual member states .
romania has a considerable number of such populated settlements .
however , I should like to say something before we move on to thecatch the eyeprocedure .
i only regret that none of them refer to cultural policy .
widespread use of micro credits is a good instrument for cohesion policy .
the president cut off the speaker 
you have run out of time .
this is important not only in a time of crisis .
it is a pity that we still do not have a concrete legislative proposal on the table .
i also approve of the allocation of additional funding for improved internet access in rural areas .
supporting sustainable competitiveness is the most effective way to achieve cohesion in the european union .
what also clearly emerges from the debate is that we need both continuity and reform in policy delivery .
we have been working with your great support over the last months on this challenge .
some of you mentioned the question of transparency .
we have many regional and local urban strategies that have successfully integrated culture into our policy .
we are also completing the independent study by a group of researchers and experts chaired by professor fabrizio barca .
the public has a very ambivalent view of european structural policy .
the reports which we have just discussed form a good foundation for this process .
this will allow european added value to be created for the european union .
european funds are in fact one of the most visible and effective manifestations of european integration .
the green paper is therefore the beginning , rather than the end of the debate on this matter .
different regions have quite different problems in terms of income levels , geographical location , migration , etc .
in my view , mr baco's vote is more of a misunderstanding .
in my report , I expressly stated that rural development resources cannot drain direct payments .
i am pleased by mr nicholson's support on this issue .
i am very pleased to see that over eur 100 billion is to be invested in protecting the environment .
i hope that this will begin in the second half of the year .
i consider it important that we continue to encourage people in this regard .
that is of considerable importance .
the second point is that there must be no frittering away of our funds .
written statements rule 142 
people from rural communities are in a particularly disadvantaged position when competing in the labour market .
these are fundamental conditions for the development of areas which are distant from large urban areas .
a micro credit can be accessed by companies with fewer than 10 employees .
the idea can just as well be applied to the unemployed , business start ups or existing micro enterprises .
this is extremely important to the countries that were relegated to the background under the yalta agreement .
this alone makes it paramount that we let this part of the eu budget through today .
similarly , trouble free implementation of programmes and projects with eu support requires high quality management and control systems .
territorial cohesion plays an important role in this respect .
this legislation must create a simple and effective procedure for selecting contactors .
excessively long tender procedures can delay realisation of structural funds .

rapporteur . mr president , I will be very brief .
as rapporteur , I was rather unsatisfied with the outcome of the votes on the amendments .
the placing of biocidal products on the market 
combating female genital mutilation in the eu 
before the vote
it is important to us that the sexual and reproductive rights of women are recognised .
mr president , this is indeed a point of order .
heckling 
so this is a point of order concerning clarification .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
green paper on territorial cohesion and debate on the future reform of the cohesion policy 
it talks about something very fundamental in the way we disburse our aid .
ms martensreport takes into account accountability and transparency , so I support it .
the european union owes its success to the gradual raising of economic barriers .
as a member of the acp eu assembly I agree that development aid is not always effective .
i believe that , if we do that , they will flourish far better and live far longer .
art education develops sensitivity and opens up creative potential .
we have also beaten the english , the french , the italians and the scottish .
sport is art , art is sport .
turkey's membership of the european union means economic and demographic death for bulgaria .
this is why we voted against this report .
that is its failure .
it is my experience that more and more people are losing faith and trust in institutions .
fi mr president , mr hegyi's report is excellent and necessary .
we need active dialogue between european nations and citizens .
we need understanding on both sides .
i can give you the answer .
this also applies to the documents drafted by participants in the debate from other countries .
no wonder the european union is so unpopular in my constituency of north east england and elsewhere in europe .
we completely ignore the result of the vote !
for a long time we thought that the only thing that affected us was what we swallowed .
one member state has saidno, we are listening and indeed we have to listen .
i hope the court of human rights takes our statement into consideration when delivering its verdict in this case .
it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for giving me the floor .
children are dying and women are dying precisely because of these practices , which are completely unacceptable .
i consider the commission notification in this area to be exceptionally important .
this has happened to me in this case and it is something that I did not wish for .
the reason was that we would like in particular to guarantee the status of minority languages .
i am sorry , but this is madness .
it will lead to the opposite of adaptation and assimilation .
that is the opposite of what is actually required in all european countries .
we have been told here today that the report deals withcertain national quarrels in spain.
mr president , I would like to congratulate mr van nistelrooij on his report .
we in this parliament must continue to insist that they do .
worldwide credit unions have reserves in excess of usd 1.1 trillion , with almost 180 million members worldwide .
at this stage , let me pay tribute to two organisations in particular .
written explanations of vote
your rapporteur takes the view that the timely collection of statistical information is of paramount importance .
in particular , where is the security council representation for asia ?
i am happy to give my support to it .
i am pleased that these recommendations extensively touch on these concerns .
now that we are facing an exodus of biblical proportions europe has suddenly been startled into reality .
i repeat that I am opposed to the report on those grounds .
lisbon , after all , has been legally dead since the referendum in ireland .
i wish to abstain on the report by mr hutchinson on mdg contracts .
this is particularly important in order to make it easier for art students to study in another member state .
in writing . it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour .
all children are born artists .
the problem is to remain an artist as we grow up . 
that body of knowledge is very large , and it is constantly growing .
this approach is flexible , and allows coordination of complex matters and a rapid reaction to current challenges .
i think it is quite the opposite .
communicating with citizens and keeping them informed must stop being simply a prescribed , ineffective proposal .
in this context it appears that the background to this report is to some extent contradictory .
it is therefore hard to speak of dialogue and compromise .
the key to effective dialogue lies in the present day , which has brought us enough problems anyway .
we need to talk !
i cannot therefore fully endorse the report .
people accept what they know , but anything that is beyond their horizon arouses concern .
each year alone I organise hundreds of meetings with young people , farmers and businessmen .
the june elections will be the first test of how effective we have been .
since the actions far more resemble propaganda than dialogue , I oppose them .
in a real dialogue , the opinions of the citizens are seen as valuable .
unfortunately , he is correct .
i am against the report by mr cornillet on the work of the acp eu joint parliamentary assembly in 200i am therefore against the tabled report .
they look pretty nice indeed .
frequent modification , by certain member states , of eligibility criteria and requisite documentation 
inadequate decentralised administrative capacity 
lack of clarity in cofinancing rules 
few opportunities for interregional cooperation , and regional structures that are inadequate for this cooperation .
respect for the principle of equal opportunities and assurance of the principles of partnership and innovative action 
we also think that some wordings pre empt the rural population's own choices .
i voted against the report by mr roszkowski on complementarities and coordination of cohesion policy with rural development measures .
therefore , I did not endorse mrs roth behrendt's report .
the regulation also introduces more stringent requirements for detailed product descriptions .
another objective is to increase the safety of cosmetic products .
however , I regret one omission , which I feel could be prejudicial to consumer protection .
the proposal was intended to simplify existing legislation .
a little coherence , please .
either it is health that takes precedence or it is the market .
experience has shown that a policy of high prices is not an effective method of combating nicotine addiction .
in order to contain this phenomenon , fine cut tobacco must be able to act as a substitute for cigarettes .
i trust that our message will nonetheless reach the council of ministers , which needs to rule unanimously .
i also find it lamentable that the rapporteur waters down the commission's proposals .
this report deals with a very serious problem and the need for measures to tackle it is made clear .
we need comprehensive strategies and action plans to allow us to protect women from the archaic tradition of circumcision .
i see no reason to throw particular suspicion on people who request asylum on these specific grounds .
i believe that enforced medical check ups constitute a massive invasion of privacy .
for this reason it is exploited by some groups in support of abortion .
the linguistic and cultural diversity of the european union is a huge competitive advantage .
the costs and bureaucracy associated with the misguided policy of multilingualism will only increase as the eu expands further .
i therefore believe that we should have a handful of working languages .
that is not a matter for the eu .
we have therefore voted against this report .
this is why multilingualism must offer new solutions to europe's citizens and our society .
this is a missed opportunity for the eu to come closer to its citizens .
one of europe's virtues is its multicultural nature , which is also expressed in multilingualism .
however , the report focuses more on learning the official languages than on implementing the idea of multilingualism .
this is not and must not be the nature of our debate .
they are also more creative and have broader horizons .
the language competences of the citizens of a united europe should constantly be extended .
multilingualism is an area with wide ramifications .
it has an enormous impact on the lives of european citizens .
definition of territorial cohesion 
integration of territorial cohesion in the future development of all community policies 
establishment of a comprehensive system of gradual transitional assistance to the transition regions and
i therefore voted in favour .
the eu's cohesion policy is badly thought out .
i live in poznań , the regional capital of wielkopolska .
urban development has nothing to do with local centralism .
some of these tasks involve close collaboration with local governments at other levels .
in writing . the urban dimension of cohesion policy needs to be given a greater priority .
i endorse adoption of the report .
at the moment , discussions about measures for relaunching credit activities are on the agenda .
these people have few options available to them .

applause 
i have great pleasure in giving the floor to the british prime minister , gordon brown .
friends , today there is no old europe , no new europe , no east or west europe .
there is only one europe , and it is our home europe .
we are uniquely placed because of what we have achieved in our union .
applause 
i know that some critics suggested that I was supporting global action more because I supported european action less .
no european country is immune from its impact .
it is hitting every business , every worker , every homeowner and every family too .
applause 
just as globalisation has been crossing national boundaries , we know it has been crossing moral boundaries too .
applause 
first , the market is there to serve us we are not here to serve the market .
we also have a responsibility to the unemployed .
applause 
europe has , therefore , a particular responsibility in the current g20 process .
we want the london summit to succeed , and I am sure it will succeed .
the commission will monitor and evaluate what member states are doing to coordinate our overall response to the crisis .
only in this way will confidence be restored , and confidence is key .
g20 finance ministers discussed at length the treatment of impaired assets less than two weeks ago .
in london , the european union must also give a strong message rejecting protectionism .
indeed , employment is our first concern now .
applause 
the eur 400 billion european aid programme will help us overcome the crisis .
we need to speed up thebasel iireforms and bring speculative funds under strict control .
it is an excellent direction .
applause 
for this reason , your visit is more than simply a visit to the european parliament .
thank you very much for this , mr brown .
this has been a permanent feature of human history and will always exist .
this is about a system in which this individual greed can spread and become destructive .
this is why it must be changed .
this is precisely what must be done .
you are right when you state that the nuclear arms race must be stopped .
you are also right that we need solidarity between people in society , but also solidarity between states .
i would like to make one final point .
above all we need an effective struggle for a better climate policy .
combining these two things is exactly the right approach .
applause 
opportunities to work with the obama administration should not be spoilt by a transatlantic war of words .
we need a european financial services authority .
we need the imf to fill that role .
the era of easy money is past .
for future growth , making a living must not equate to making a killing .
and those parties pushing themselves and britain to the sidelines of europe will cost their country dear .
so let britain be a positive partner , cast in the european mould .
prime minister , I expect the single currency to emerge stronger from this crisis .
nice speech , mr brown , but what are you ready to do , really ?
the european union has followed others in succumbing to this temptation .
this speaks volumes of the nature of the challenges of our times .
perhaps you would have more moral authority in this house if your actions matched your words .
once again today you try to spread the blame around .
we are now running a deficit that touches 10 % of gdp an almost unbelievable figure .
you know , and we know , and you know that we know it is nonsense .
everyone knows that britain is worse off than any other country as we go into these hard times .
the imf has said so .
if we do not understand the problem , we will not be able to understand the solution .
this has to be done and it has to be done by global cooperation .
more manufacturing is being done in asia than in europe .
we had domestic competition .
i believe that the lesson of this crisis is that we are now in a global economy .
that will require us to shape global institutions , and my message to this parliament is very clear .
welcoming a british prime minister to the european parliament is always a very exciting occasion .
however , at the same time , differences of opinion still exist between the main leaders .
the new decision is to be taken by 6 november this year .
it earned parliament's sympathy in a decision making procedure in which parliament formed its own opinion .
i would like to thank the presidency of the council of the european union for achieving this compromise .
question time is not being heard this week , either by the council or the commission .
people can come in here and speak at all sorts of great length .
both the eu and china would benefit from increased trade .
we heard prime minister brown talking about this in terms of the international financial crisis .
i also want to congratulate mr mitchell and thank him for his report .
thank you very much .
in any case , I believe that some sort of advantageous specialisation is necessary .
i am cautious with regard to this question of turning outward and inward .
for this reason , I am in favour of controls , but of a different kind .
over recent years a large section of the public has hardly been aware of their presence .
they should instead supplement each other's work and work together in a complementary way .
these projects require large amounts of machinery and are highly capital intensive .
thank you .
the european union's recovery measures are accompanied by mandatory measures of financial prudence .
it would be a serious issue if it were to go bust , like some of our commercial banks .
i thought the world had seen enough of clever financial tricks .
these eib operations are of utmost importance in an environment of global financial crisis and recession .
i am counting on the support of all the political groups of this house .
it is timely and welcome in particular for three reasons .
i hope that we will have the opportunity to return to these issues later .
what point have we reached today ?
that is what mrs stauner was hoping for .
we are therefore still in the hands of those who would like to take an initiative in this regard .
mr president , I want to thank all the members who have spoken in this debate .
i urge that on the three institutions represented here today and on the house .
i have raised this issue on a number of occasions .
look at this model for the developing world .
thank you , mr president , for the opportunity to respond to this debate .
all's well that ends well .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports 
the system can also be expressed more simply .
abb and abm put the emphasis on and promote efficiency .
activity based management puts the emphasis on personal responsibility , but it also allows for freedom of action .
there is no need for inessential reports and planning .
bureaucracy and the fact that it is on the increase , however , are a real danger .
the commission has agreed to present an evaluation of this area .
this relates both to the european development fund and the athena mechanism .
congratulations !
this will be a decisive influence .
i cannot do this , even though I am chairman of the committee on budgetary control .
i am very grateful for your suggestions .
that means that we will already be groping around in the margins of the agricultural budget .
how high is the hit rate of the annual policy strategy in this respect ?
it is not a theoretical exercise . it is necessary in order to be able to manage money correctly .
we already have the current screening report thank you .
we want to make the abm / abb management tool better , not extend it over two years .
if it does not , it needs changing .
too much is left in the budget because we cannot change things because of the restrictions of the mff .
it is right for there to be a ban on eu public indebtedness .
how can achieving political objectives be compared with building a power station or transport networks ?
the same applies to the mid term review of the multiannual financial framework .
mrs grybauskaitė , I wish you the greatest success in the coming elections .
today we have heard what mr brown is proposing and what should be on the agenda .
all three institutions must find the political courage to do this together .
as the previous speaker said , it is not a budget for the 21st century .
it is clearly based on the idea that the eu's expenditure should just carry on increasing ad infinitum .
i would like to mention three points very briefly .
that treaty has been rejected .
firstly , we must acknowledge the limitations of the financial perspective agreement adopted in 2006 by the member states .
we cannot allow ourselves any more failed financial perspectives in the future .
firstly , our aspirations for the budget review itself .
in our view , it is unacceptable to focus only on the forthcoming financial framework .
this is particularly relevant , of course , if our demand for an extension should be implemented .
these include climate policy jobs and growth and foreign and development policy .
fourthly , we want a revised and fairer system for the eu's own resources .
this should clearly urge us to be cautious in the way our interventions are formulated .
it would be a failure for all of us .
that is indeed the position of this house .
we know that this revision will be carried out once the next european parliament is in place .
it is a crucial question which we must answer how much money and for what policies ?
we shall have to address two important difficulties in this major negotiation 
secondly , that the principle of cohesion and solidarity between the member states must not end and
just allow me to give you an example involving money from the solidarity fund .
this is what parliament is calling for very strongly and collectively in this report .
the debate is closed .
currently cohesion policy and measures connected with realisation of the lisbon strategy can count on the greatest support .
there is no prospect of improvement in the remaining months of this year .
further projects with a total value of several billion euro are already being planned for 200these projects involve not only car manufacturers , but also suppliers to the car industry .
the process will be painful , but it is inevitable .
more than 200 000 jobs throughout europe are dependent on the company .
there is no national solution to this problem .
there can only be a transatlantic solution which involves the parent company .
i would like to repeat some of what you have said .
the european automotive industry is the sector's world leader in technological terms .
this cutting edge industry must be protected .
the socialist group in the european parliament wants to protect jobs .
we also congratulate mr verheugen on the initiative he has taken with regard to this .
therefore , we need to find new approaches .
therefore , we should avoid taking shareholdings in the car industry .
i would also like to thank my fellow members for supporting the initiative involved in this resolution .
my group has tabled amendments on all of these points .
many european countries have introduced scrappage schemes and efforts in this direction have now begun in the uk .
in my country , austria , many thousands of workers are directly or indirectly affected by the crisis .
in addition , a large number of small and medium sized supply companies are dependent on the car industry .
we have a large general motors manufacturing site in vienna .
finally , a word about protectionist measures .
globalists all over the world unite !
however , in another very important respect , it is also a problem that has to do with overcapacity .
we need to support those people engaged in the car industry .
furthermore , I believe that the european parliament's activity in strasbourg should be discontinued .
hence this call , commissioner verheugen , to you and to the commission .
commissioner verheugen , it is not too late for action .
thank you very much .
in our resolution we have discussed short term measures .
we welcome the fact that you brought europe's ministers for economic affairs together to find a european approach .
secondly , you referred to the european funds that serve to relieve the social impact on workers .
i will fight for the future of their jobs .
we must tackle these challenges with a european , sectoral and forward looking approach and through social consultation .
the most important of these have already been mentioned .
we will be most socially minded and show the greatest solidarity if we support ecology and energy orientated restructuring .
the current crisis has also shown that the european car industry is strongly interconnected .
this is only right and proper .
i have confidence that our manufacturers , our technical specialists and our engineers can achieve this .
we have the potential to achieve this .
the banks are not providing funds .
the car industry is not the only sector which we are asking the eib to help with .
all of this is being provided by the eib .
i very much share mr groote's opinion on co2 based vehicle tax .
there is a certain amount of european solidarity involved here , which should not be underestimated .
the vote will take place tomorrow wednesday , 25 march 2009 .
the latter must be the subject of particular attention at both national and eu levels .
from 2012 we will have a schengen airspace .
the commission's initial proposal has been supplemented by two elements introduced by parliament .
the new specifications issued by easa must integrate with the existing ones .
in addition , the opportunity has been given to mention the derogations granted so far .
this has certainly been a major commitment and one that , I repeat , constitutes an effective response .
this second package of legislation will allow us to manage our airspace more efficiently in the years to come .
this organisation must be provided with the staff and equipment it needs in good time .
in addition , military no fly zones prevent planes from flying in a straight line from one airport to another .
the council has opposed this right until the end .
let us resurrect efficiency by allowing the supply to feed the demand and allowing innovation .
i would like to thank mr marinescu for his excellent report and the commission for its initiative .
however , we should not only be concerned about improving functionality here and now in the current crisis .
we should also continue to focus on important issues from the past .
it provides a few people with employment in the security checks at airports .
we are waiting impatiently for the regulation to be abolished .
there are , however , a few areas where I would seek a little bit of clarification .
its profits are set to drop by 12 % .
i do not see significant progress being made by russia , but we shall persevere .
since there was no possibility of including it , it was not included in the legislative text .
to conclude , I am grateful to you once again .
the lack of rules and existence of weak rules has given rise to the financial and economic crisis .
i also thank the french presidency and czech presidency for their efforts , especially thierry boutsen and vera zazvorkova .
the vote will take place tomorrow wednesday , 25 march 2009 .

regional airports may find it very hard to sustain the added costs of updating their systems .

interoperability of mobile chargers debate 
nowadays , anyone who changes their mobile phone generally needs a completely different charger .
this is not a new issue .
in the meantime , these difficulties have been overcome and there are no technical reasons which would prevent harmonisation .
we should under no circumstances exclude the possibility of introducing legal regulations .
the commission will not hesitate to make a legislative proposal if the industry does not introduce a voluntary agreement .
in addition , we should ask the standards institutes to produce proposals which will make this possible .
of course , this is not as easy as it seems .
on the one hand , we have the connection between the charger and the mobile phone .
perhaps we could involve the international organisation for standardisation iso in order to find a worldwide solution .
you then need to find a specific charger of a specific make and model .
my compliments , again , commissioner .
de madam president , I have a further question for commissioner verheugen .
the debate is closed .
common consular instructions biometric identifiers and visa applications debate 
i have been negotiating with the council for quite a long time .
you know that my group strongly opposes the extensive introduction of biometrics .
however , we have many concerns .
therefore , we cannot support parliament's position at second reading .
however , this does not prejudice our position on the lax report on the visa code .
however , this must not be done at the expense of the applicants and of data security .
i would like to thank everyone for their work on this dossier over recent years .
this is equivalent to a new city the size of birmingham .
in addition to that , we probably have one million illegal immigrants .
what we do not need is a system devised by the european union .
look at another example of eu legislation championed by the liberal democrats .
the introduction of fingerprints and photographs will ensure that the new visas cannot be forged or misused .
for this reason , I am supporting this more citizen friendly approach .
in the course of our work together , this has not always been the case , baroness ludford .
it will also result in an overall improvement in the eu's image .
i shall convey to my colleague mr barrot all that they have said today .
i think mr batten , as usual , was somewhat muddled in his thinking .
i thank all the other speakers who made constructive contributions .
written statements rule 142 
novel foods debate 
i must also mention the cooperation with the czech presidency .
i was also surprised that the commission proposal took the internal market as its starting point .
i will begin with that point .
that brings me on to my second point , namely what arenovel foods, actually ?
that was never really made clear in the commission proposal .
it relates to questions regarding nanoparticles and nanomaterial .
this is an extremely important issue and its importance is growing .
for example , we cannot demand that a novel food has no negative impact on the environment .
people have the right to know what they eat and make their choices accordingly .
if some people are concerned about nanotechnology , then they should be able to make a different choice .
we will see tomorrow how the members from germany have voted , because there is a labelling loophole here .
we do not want to take away the consumersright to choose for themselves .
thank you .
the commission has submitted a good proposal for updating the regulation on novel foods .
why should there not be a reference to nanosubstances in the list of ingredients ?
a brief remark on cloning .
it is animal cruelty and we are opposed to it .
nevertheless foods must be included in this regulation , because otherwise .
a major consideration is the strict regulatory system of labelling .
it would be more appropriate to regulate cloning in a separate regulation .
i also regard amendment 60 as important .
why do we respond as if we are scientific illiterates on any new aspect of this area ?
the same question can be asked of national parliaments .
if not , our credibility as legislators is in question .
through our input and our proposals , we will succeed in achieving this aim .
our atmosphere is formed in such a way that there are two different layers that protect us .
the co2 in the tropospheric layer holds in the warmth so that we do not get too cold .
that allows the member states the possibility of adopting more far reaching measures to protect the environment .
secondly , the use of the pesticide methyl bromide will be prohibited as of 18 march 20this also applies to the gassing of containers to control vermin .
the only remaining exception will be for emergencies , such as where a large scale epidemic occurs .
it has also been agreed , in this regard , that there must be no increase in laboratory use .
the benefits , both in terms of restoring the ozone layer and reducing greenhouse gases , will be considerable .
the montreal protocol itself has had additions made to it no less than four times .
it thus became necessary to amend the weak points in the treaty .
it will not cut global emissions and will not even reduce carbon intensiveness .
climate change is an environmental problem on a totally different scale from earlier problems .
let us learn a lesson from montreal .
that is fine , mrs doyle , please do so .
thank you .
in that way we will be obtaining precise information about this substance .
in every case , the result was satisfactory .
closure of the sitting
the sitting was closed at 11 p.m. 
the sitting was opened at 9.10 a.m. 
we should take a look at the history books , which have clearly been gathering dust .
markets are nervous , reacting immediately , excessively and negatively to every signal .
it is precisely here that most of the noise and criticism is centred in my view undeservedly .
the plan is allegedly deficient , slow and unambitious .
i would like to set the record straight .
the second major theme of the european council was the climate and energy question .
the gas crisis has not been resolved .
it is more than clear that we need this .
it proves that , even when times are tough , solidarity is not a hollow word in europe .
the debate that we held yesterday with the uk prime minister , gordon brown , clearly demonstrated this .
this is not a technocratic agenda .
people must be re installed at the heart of the global economy .
we are in favour of open and competitive economies , but economies in which the markets serve the citizens .
however , the european council also looked beyond the crisis .
this investment is critical in these difficult times .
we also need to continue to deepen the work of coordination .
we have some instruments .
this is my number one concern , and I think it should be the number one concern in europe .
you have a wealth of knowledge about action on the ground .
but it was in no sense the end of a process .
we need to keep up the momentum of the process .
applause 
this is the meaning of european integration .
we need more jobs , and this package of measures will allow this .
so what about obstruction by your own people ?
what gordon brown said yesterday was the opposite of what you said here .
that is what you said here a few moments ago .
that is not the level at which the european union can work with the us .
that is the big mistake that you are making here .
the president of the commission said something very important today .
we have no time for that .
that is the wrong signal .
i personally feel very sorry for you .
no problem , we are by your side and will do whatever we can .
applause 
laughter 
all these are welcome .
america will come to the g20 with her own agenda .
we must arrive with ours and together reach a deal that delivers for all .
see to it that domestic difficulties do not sap your stride .
together this means barely eur 20 million annually for each country which is part of the project .
in fact a decision has been made to refuse any kind of cooperation in this area .
at the summit eur 5 billion was also allocated to the anti crisis package .
what are the four elements of trust which roosevelt won ?
the first was reregulation .
even if gordon brown were the champion of deregulation , maybe this shows that change can happen .
secondly , strengthen the social fabric .
roosevelt's fourth issue was his economic investment .
one is that we need green eurobonds .
the conclusions of the summit in this regard are very vague .
throughout the crisis I have repeatedly questioned the commission about its desire to regulate and control the financial sector .
it continually refers to the right of the internal market to govern what happens .
the single currency is part of the problem , not part of the solution .
yesterday the government of the czech prime minister and eu council president mirek topolánek lost a vote of confidence .
following the collapse of the topolánek government president václav klaus has the strongest political mandate in the czech republic .
nevertheless , it is impossible that banknote printers will be the only ones to profit from this crisis .
it was not our decision that this summit would be a troika .
the lisbon treaty .
i have to say that responsibility for moving the situation forwards really lies with those who created the situation .
the commission .
i have to say that our ambition is to achieve political agreement at the june european council .
we will of course consult with you it is essential to have discussions with the european parliament .
we did not talk about how much money we would give to people .
he ignored the enormous debt burden he has placed on the british people .
europe needs no lectures from the british government about what must be done to get out of this crisis .
i am sorry , but I have not seen any concrete measures .
that is 0.04 % of this union's gross national product .
the imf has proposed that you invest 2 % of gdp this year and next year .
i ask myself how is that ?
please , we cannot do it in this way .
you cannot do it in this way . what we need is real investment .
we are on your side and will support you in getting that .
this unemployment crisis will not disappear because we refuse to have more meetings .
this is about the destiny of the european union's economic , monetary and social efforts .
if you can do that , we will be with you .
applause 
legislation governing the financial sector should have the effect of blunting rather than exacerbating economic cycles .
however , more regulation does not necessarily mean better regulation what we need is the right regulation .
i would like to highlight a few areas in which we need to continue to work .
his own record of managing the uk economy is one of negligence and catastrophe .
this is where the corrections should apply .
the agreement at the eu summit last week is not strong enough to instigate a new , sustainably oriented economy .
the european union must take a lead in that regard .
where is the eu's leadership when it comes to tangible funding ?
when I listen to the chairman of the socialist group , I think I am on another planet .
how can someone who has obstructed that for a decade today be declared our saviour ?
the economic and financial crisis has of course already been mentioned .
the czech social democrats have always supported the european constitution and have always supported ratification of the lisbon treaty .
what must we do to avoid these problems ?
now decisions are often taken on the basis of past history , how we behaved in situations of crisis .
pl mr president , during the recent european summit many subjects were raised .
we should be especially sensitive to the problems of new member states .
however , we are also living on credit as far as the environment and climate are concerned .
unfortunately , I do not believe that the czech republic alone is to blame .
this will require proactive interventions by member state governments .
the light touch regulation of the financial markets was always a road to rip off and corruption .
that is the question .
it is a charter for the policies of failure .
they resemble a victory statement of routed armies everywhere .
the election of václav klaus as president also belongs to the politics of double standards .
the treaty is now under serious threat and this is partly also your responsibility .
if you continue to govern in any form , you should make a clear stand for ratification .
it is important to have a european securities commission and to maintain the stability pact .
what is needed is the political will and unity which will make it possible to translate this into reality .
you were talking about a crisis of confidence .
the european parliament is not involved at all one month before the european parliament elections .
gm , the united states and sweden have been mentioned in the debate today .
another point is the solutions for eastern european countries and countries that are not in the single currency .
these countries are being let down somewhat , with a sum of eur 50 billion being mentioned .
i , too , had expected a truer european dimension in the approach to the crisis .
solidarity with less developed countries must also form part of the european union's global approach .
we , parliament , must set out our position clearly .
this sort of investment is furthermore especially suited to our times .
unfortunately , the summit was unable to convince people of this .
this must not be allowed to happen !
we must not allow the spectre of protectionism to wreak havoc once again .
the national supervisory authorities will also be given a better opportunity to coordinate themselves and exchange information .
policy must be appropriate even in times of crisis .
such language belongs to the machtpolitik cold war era , not to modern diplomacy .
that , my friends , is a recipe for fanning an uncontrollable forest fire .
president in office topolánek chose sweden as a comparison to america .
why not the czech republic ?
not only has financial credit contracted but also social credit .
therefore , a social european union summit , leading towards a european pact on employment , is a must .
programmes to facilitate the stabilisation and integration of the latter are crucial for the survival of the former .
i wish us all success in this matter .
where is the firm commitment to abolish tax havens and offshore financial centres ?
will they never learn ?
implementation procedures can be too clumsy and time consuming .
as usual a crisis provides opportunities for reform .
eur 5 billion for strategic energy projects and broadband internet .
is the glass half full or half empty ?
the first , of course , is jobs .
et several important matters were agreed upon in the council .
this is not rhetoric , mr topolánek , this is a call for action .
if self satisfaction and fiction were instruments of economic recovery , then we might call it a success .
the agenda for this council has already been expurgated of any proposals that might have related to employment .
that was postponed until may .
that is why we should also support commissioner kovács in tabling more proposals for progressive depreciation .
the decisions we took there were fundamental and important .
i would like to say one thing to those of you who have specific doubts and questions .
i would like to thank you for your very committed personal contribution .
good luck for the continuation of your work .
we can be proud of what we have decided , but there should be no room for complacency .
applause 
now we are waiting for a response from the six countries which have a direct interest in the programme .
applause 
i am referring to the two reports which follow .
aerodromes , air traffic management and air navigation services 
novel foods 
ec cariforum states economic partnership agreement vote 
it is up to you .
mr guardans cambó , we will take this as a test case .
madam president , the answer isyes.
the oral amendment was accepted . 
ec ghana economic partnership agreement vote 
ec pacific states interim partnership agreement vote 
ec eac partner states economic partnership agreement vote 
economic partnership agreement between the ec and cariforum 
the fact that she is here for this vote says much about her .
this vote was scheduled for tuesday .
de madam president , ladies and gentlemen , this is a point of order .
have no fear , I shall not read the entire letter .
de therefore , all references in official documents to rule 47 have to be deleted .
stepping stone agreement towards an economic partnership agreement between the ec and côte d ivoire 
rapporteur . madam president , I will be very brief .
eib and ebrd annual reports for 2007 
future of the car industry vote 
we still have two minutes left .
the next item is the vote .
oral explanations of vote
madam president , defined external frontiers are the essential attribute of nationhood .
i believe in equal treatment , and we can deal with an opinion .
on the marinescu report , I deliberately voted for the marinescu report .
this issue is still regulated on the basis of the 1944 chicago convention .
this is by no means the case .
madam president , it is always a pleasure to be present with you in explanations of votes .
people will start to talk soon .
madam president , I voted against this report for two reasons .
she is to be applauded for finding consensus on this issue .
i hope my words meet with your seal of approval .
we all know that the car industry is having some serious financial problems .
i could say that I think you and your two colleagues will probably owe me lunch after this .
across europe it represents over 20 % of manufacturing .
however , this is only possible if the biometric data are recorded correctly .
there still appear to be problems here .
an fab coordinator should also be introduced along the lines of the ten coordinators .
the commission proposal seeks to make the authorisation procedure more effective and transparent and to implement it better .
furthermore , where novel foods serve to replace another food , they must not be nutritionally inferior .
i have voted in favour of mr liotard's proposal on novel foods .
that is why I am in favour .
i have voted in favour of mr blokland's report on substances that deplete the ozone layer .
by taking this kind of action we are fulfilling our duty to both the current generation and future generations .
for example , it should be clarified that thescarceresources are defined by the eu .
in writing . it I am voting in favour .
that is the way that we are demanding for france and for europe too .
out of respect for these parliaments , I believe that we need to hold off on passing this resolution .
the affected ivorians would then be able to work as carers and in similar professions .
many of these nations also desire a strengthening of the provisions surrounding food security and infant industry .
the crucial objective of developing the agreements ,
the renegotiation of the contentious points of the agreements on the basis of an open and flexible approach ,
food security and the protection of the fragile industries of acp countries .
i do , however , intend to keep an extremely close eye on its implementation .
i have voted in favour of mr martin's recommendation on the ec / cariforum economic partnership agreement .
this is not a satisfactory development .
however , the resolution has come a little late and does not meet all expectations .
they point to a further fall in sales of new cars .
we should help the car industry to recover , but we should not try to reinvent the wheel .
in writing . car manufacturing within the eu depends upon reaching standards which can facilitate stronger environmental rules .
there are many european instruments which can be used to assist the car industry and its workers in particular .
in the automotive sector there is an enormous potential for moving in a green direction .
transport is responsible for around a third of all co2 emissions in the eu .
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
the report's second objective is to strengthen cooperation in practice .
there is much in the report with which the presidency , and the council , can agree .
the transatlantic relationship allows us to achieve together results which neither partner alone can deliver .
when we agree , we can set the terms of the global agenda .
high expectations were created on both sides of the atlantic .
all these initiatives are what many in europe have been calling for .
the dialogue with the us has been reinvigorated .
i welcome the pragmatic approach which has characterised these early contacts .
while the change of tone is important , it does not of course in itself deliver concrete outcomes .
your report is a valuable contribution to that process .
it is a process which will need to continue to be developed over the coming months .
firstly , energy security and climate change .
these interconnected topics are of concern to a great many europeans .
the eu has established ambitious energy and climate change commitments in advance of the conference .
thirdly , afghanistan is a key issue for both europe and the us .
we have engaged with the us , and the new administration , at every level from the outset .
we are looking forward to a busy eu us calendar .
we must seize this opportunity .
we must therefore develop clear positions based on our own common interests , and speak with one voice .
a strong eu is thus an important partner for the us in tackling global challenges .
protectionist elements on both sides of the atlantic need to be resisted .
this plays very much to the eu's strengths as the world's largest donor .
the new us emphasis on civilian capacity building and the regional approach focusing on pakistan converge with longstanding eu policies .
i am actively looking at whether we can provide additional funding in all of these areas .
the other day we also discussed it with richard holbrooke , the special envoy for both afghanistan and pakistan .
similarly , in the middle east we have been asking for closer us engagement from the very outset .
the eu also plays a major role in our eastern neighbourhood .
this will then set the scene for a successful eu us summit in washington , probably in june .
we also want these standards to be met by products supplied by the us to europe .
then we too shall have no problems .
either we do this together , or we will not be able to do it .
there are asymmetries between the two shores of the atlantic that negatively affect transatlantic cooperation .
therefore , the strengthening of the political european union is essential for future cooperation with the united states .
for data sharing , though , it must be a robust and binding legal framework of data protection .
the clearest demonstration of the change in approach from president obama is the intention to close guantánamo bay .
but such cooperation can only be supported if it delivers fair treatment .
finally I would like to address the subject of the alde group amendments which concern online gambling .
mr president , there is probably no important international problem which we could solve on our own .
i am not only talking about iran , iraq or afghanistan .
in spite of optimistic declarations , the future of nato is in question today .
the same applies to issues such as torture and rendition .
what exactly does that act state ?
the act prohibits us institutions and citizens from cooperating with , or passing information to , the icc .
the position taken in the report is unaccountably circumspect .
the document includes calls to set up two new combined eu us bodies and a proposal on this .
in my opinion literary creations of this sort should not be submitted to the european parliament .
we still do not know that .
china's gdp is catching up with that of the us .
fourthly , in points 31 and 32 there is a series of precise plans concerning russia .
we need to remind ourselves of what we want to achieve .
each of those initiatives can only survive if there is strong support from both sides .
one is the trade dispute agenda .
we would like to have a hearing on container security on both sides very soon .
this was agreed at our last tec meeting , but a follow up will be needed .
let us also remember about visas , which the united states still requires in relation to some member states .
this should not be happening in transatlantic relations between the eu and the us .
we ought to take advantage of that fact .
we need a stronger europe and a genuine partnership with the us to achieve the millennium development goals .
it is unacceptable for some of the european union's citizens to be treated as second class citizens .
i am thinking of european institutions , european universities and european foundations .
mr president , president obama said america has no better partner than europe.
the election of president obama started a new chapter in transatlantic relations that has suffered serious setbacks .
my second point I welcome president obama's commitment to diplomacy with the islamic republic of iran .
europe's high expectations of president obama must now be backed by action .
furthermore , we have grown aware of climate change and have faced financial , economic and energy crises .
for a long time europe and the united states have been allies vital to prosperity , development and globalisation .
europe is extending an open hand to the united states .
member states from the former eastern bloc have a particular debt of gratitude to the united states .
this report consolidates in a very useful document europe's main priorities in its relations with the united states .
i am also pleased that the amendments which I suggested have been included in the report .
first of all , cooperation in the area of security must continue .
es mr president , we ought to shout outgood news !
good news !.
he fundamentally divided european governments , although public opinion not so much .
in conclusion , I would like to add the following reflections .
for example , we are now being asked to provide greater strategic input on afghanistan .
first , the role of legislators in , and the institutional set up of , eu us relations is very important .
we will , therefore , continue to raise this issue .
the report must be readable .
the debate is closed .
this is the main conclusion and motto that can be drawn from this excellent report .
among them , I find people to people contacts to be the true key to lasting relations and cooperation .
it is unacceptable that nationals of five eu member states still face obstacles and need visas to travel to america .
let people interact , researchers cooperate and businesses find joint solutions to the current economic crisis .
the next item is the joint debate on 
this has been on the back burner for a long while , and there is a reason for that .
we would probably then move for a postponement of the vote .
in spite of this , talks should be conducted with this country and the agreement should be signed .
let us remember that certain positive social signs have appeared there .
the recent adoption by turkmenistan of legislation introducing a ban on child labour is one of these signs .
i think it is important that we support the legislation coming out to bring turkmenistan closer to us .
so what is the main problem ?
turkmenistan is in many ways growing in importance .
there are many aspects to the union's relations with turkmenistan .
the fact that turkmenistan borders afghanistan makes it also a strategically important country .
these are all important areas which we need to develop in our own interests .
all this is evidence that turkmenistan is moving ahead .
the only treaty based dialogue consists of a meeting of a joint committee at officials level once a year .
the pca , once in force , would go further by providing for a fully fledged political dialogue .
such agreements already exist in the case of kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan .
it is important for it to be actively neutral in a very tense region that is ripe for destabilisation .
as we all know , central asia could play a very important role where energy security is concerned .
avoid changing language when you speak .
clearly give references to documents .
explain abbreviations that you use in what you say .
monitoring does not mean that we want to sit at the negotiating table .
so , between these two extremes , what should we do ?
we cannot sabotage our own policy by renouncing our values .
so , how should we do this ?
well , we should take two pencils , one in each hand .
i freely admit that the government under president berdymukhamedov has made progress .
that is uncontested .
this was a package deal that was ultimately demanded , but you have said nothing about it .
at the very least a position statement should have been made on this .
i hope that we shall together unanimously document this tomorrow .
that has not been delivered .
the president cut off the speaker 
what has been given as justification for this ?
the justification given was the fact that the absence of an agreement has not produced any results either .
i am nevertheless convinced that policies of suspending relations and isolation in respect of turkmenistan show little promise .
that is not to say that the country's hydrocarbon resources are not important .
journalists and activists are unable to work freely and all opponents are threatened on a daily basis .
so let us avoid being hypocritical , let us make it plain .
the debate concentrated mostly on human rights and that is not surprising for us .
some of us also touched on cooperation with the red cross .
this also applies to turkmenistan .
yes , they are but they are changes and these changes must be acknowledged and they must be encouraged .
so we have to help turkmenistan to help itself .
the commission can make a proposal to that effect .
in addition , technical meetings under the pca , the cooperation committee and the subcommittees , were suspended .
it has taken us much further down the line .
i think that this should be possible within the framework of the current agreements .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
this has been acknowledged by some representatives of civil society in belarus .
however , there have also been incidents which are a cause for our concern .
we are also following closely complaints from the opposition overforcible conscriptionto the army .
these were the considerations which lay behind our decision on 16 march .
we hope that the dialogue will continue over the coming months .
we remain realistic and do not expect any dramatic changes .
belarus is one of the six eastern partnership countries .
belarus has taken measures that are unquestionably along the lines of more democracy .
but political repression still remains a serious problem in belarus .
the european policy that we want must clearly contribute to greater freedom and openness .
there are a couple more points I would like to add .
my final comment is on a somewhat more personal note .
i think that in this connection we should , however , maintain some kind of dialogue .
we must also be very careful .
these are ways in which belarus can profit from the new policy , after many years of isolation .
that is not in accordance with our rules of procedure .
i would like to remind you that belarus declared itself a republic on 25 march 19five thousand people have gathered in the square .
as for dialogue with belarus , this is necessary , but not at any price .
i would like to remind you that for russian citizens the schengen visa is half this price .
i repeat intervene when citizensrights are violated .
hu european policy on the belarus issue was unambiguous .
many in the eu believe that the success of the eastern partnership depends on belarus as well .
the eu institutions have succeeded in killing off their own set of conditions .
the commission's work over many years has been torn down by a single visit by javier solana .
dialogue must strengthen the democratic forces .
only then does it make sense .
that notwithstanding , visa costs should be reduced .
is it not an affront to those who have been imprisoned again recently and who are still being imprisoned ?
at the same time , the picture is mixed , and I think the debate here confirmed that .
we very much appreciate the interest and active involvement of the european parliament on belarus .
to that end , monitoring is required .
on the issue of visas , the situation is equally clear .
it was a turning point for us and for europe .
that is the hallmark of democracy .
it is something we should value .
i very much believe that the subject of our debate today rises above party politics .
it is about values more important than party differences .
this report will provide the opportunity for further political debate on the need for new eu initiatives .
i am looking forward to the debate .
is the commission providing funding from the europe for citizens instrument ?
how are you supporting the establishment of 23rd august asvictims of totalitarianismday ?
i , myself , am a historian .
it is important that we make clear to them as well the horrors of both regimes .
he voluntarily entered the auschwitz extermination camp to organise the resistance movement and gather information about mass murders .
yesterday in parliament we celebrated the european day of home made ice cream .
it is intolerable and unbearable that in twenty years this has not happened .
it has nothing to do with objective , genuinely independent assessments .
i am not blind of course and under so called communism there was repression , injustice and coercion .
yes , it is necessary to investigate and justly condemn the crimes .
no , we have to deal with , not argue about , the question of dictatorships .
it is not a matter for academic study .
the member then spoke in russian 
for that poem osip mandelstam was sent into exile .
in december 1938 his body was placed in a common grave .
the europe of today should remember the victims of 20th century totalitarian regimes worldwide .
those victims are today the foundation of our memory , the lasting spiritual basis of european democracy .
we want to face up to this problem seriously .
half truths , one sided interpretations and the denial of historical truth weakens europeans .
we can make use of the experience of the european court of human rights .
why ?
the view of a totalitarian regime from the outside is very different from the view from the inside .
you deceive yourselves .
communists have no intention of bowing their heads .
they have defended their ideology even with their lives .
this is important , because the shadows of the past have not disappeared .
this is not very precise .
the inhuman face of communism was leonid brezhnev and his predecessors and successors .
we should make no distinction between these twin criminals that is what they were .
but , minister , your country suffered jan palach lost his life .
don't forget usis what your brave countrymen said .
this evening , commissioner , we do not forget those who suffered .
applause 
i never forgot , even when I was young , the suffering that people were experiencing under communist dictatorship .
this was not an obstacle to my being an anti franco fighter and condemning the franco system .
we must not downplay the significance of these crimes , and we must not deny them .
the remainder represented democratic systems .
no such system has the right to exist .
madam president , there is a further dimension to this debate .
madam president , europe has a turbulent history with regard to totalitarianism and the restriction of basic freedoms .
the hungarians in romania , the people I represent , are such a case .
that person still feels , even when just walking down the street , that he is no longer alive .
opportunism is most evident when gross crimes against humanity committed during the last century are neglected .
but there is no reason to stay limited of mind and fearful forever .
why is it important to have such a platform at the european level ?
it is important as an instrument against forgetting .
this is also a chance to combat the relativisation of past crimes .
hitler and stalin are two of a kind .
there are many different kinds of fanaticism .
this debate is just one step but other matters will follow .
we must remember this .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 142 
however , the problem in bulgaria of vote buying indicates the exact opposite .
this is not a matter of celebrating the sufferings of millions of people .
strengthening security and fundamental freedoms on the internet debate 
does the fact that I visit these websites mean that I consent to my society going back 40 years ?
it is feasible .
we are strongly committed to promoting the high standards of protection which eu citizens enjoy at present .
let me conclude with a general comment .
it is , therefore , in the spirit of cooperation that the commission welcomes and supports this report .
the section on the applications of the technology monitoring internet traffic , for example is very important .
let us work on that with the ip enforcement directive and highlight these points in that directive .
it is a new arena for the exchange of opinions that is sorely needed for political mobilisation .
it has brought about increased knowledge .
who decides what constitute controversial political beliefs ?
the right of internet users to be able to delete permanently personal data found on websites is also important .
other groups have also been affected .
the sex industry today uses the internet and the sexual violence that many women and children suffer .
these restrictions have resulted in a security risk for citizens .
the security services of various countries have traded the personal data that they have obtained by monitoring the internet .
i urge you to give great backing to this report tomorrow .
i appeal to manufacturers to respond to our suggestion .
i truly hope that we can achieve this with the cooperation of the industry .
i wish to extend my congratulations to mr lambrinidis and the whole team who contributed to producing this report .
i wish briefly to pick out a couple of points .
i have brought along a book , which is the treaty establishing a constitution for europe .
i believe that the charter brings together the principles set out by mr lambrinidis in his report .
this right is recognised by article ii 71 of the treaty establishing a constitution for europe .
i therefore believe that the lambrinidis report covers these concerns .
i therefore call on you , ladies and gentlemen , to endorse my amendments 2 to that is not how things stand today , but we hope that one day it will be .
i , for one , no longer can .
i come from estonia , which is a world leader in internet availability .
bg ladies and gentlemen , the content of this report fully lives up to its title .
these terms are often infiltrated by slang , cynicism and even vulgarity .
some of these problems require new technical solutions .
rapporteur . mr president , I would like to thank the commission .
but I have the impression that they are fighting a battle on the wrong report .
let me read , in particular , how balanced we have attempted to be with this report .
the amendments , however , are anything but balanced .
this reference in the report does not talk aboutcriminalspeech .
i know it is not easy .
thank you , colleagues .
the vote will take place on thursday , 26 march 200written statements rule 142 
i believe the internet has enhanced europeanslives in countless ways .
we spoke during the last part session on the need to tackle child pornography .
it is a first substantive and important step .
we are also exchanging views with team sports .
i intend to follow up on these discussions by convening a further meeting at this high level in june .
the political debate on sport in europe often attributes great importance to the so calledeuropean sport model.
the european ministers for sport repeated the request to the commission in biarritz .
it is time we heard from the commission itself whether it has yet started to develop these guidelines .
dynamic changes in society are being accompanied by changes in sport .
there is a clear link with the question tabled by mrs batzeli .
what everyone is asking about is legal certainty .
many of these governing bodies believe that it will recognise concretely their specificity , the specificity of sport .
so , what is your interpretation of a sporting organisation banning such a practice ?
i look forward to maintaining this approach .
i have said that we can address specific concrete issues theme by theme rather than case by case .
of course it is not an absolute rule but it concerns specific arrangements .
we have spoken to them and have read the papers but there is nothing new there .
in substance we cannot say that we agree with the study .
we agreed to make room for more expertise and for more exchange .
i think that is very beneficial .
it also concerns the level of competence .
we would like to promote an increased legal certainty , which is why we started the process .
i would like to invite you to share this approach because we do not have a better one .
the debate is closed .
safe and environmentally sound recycling of ships debate 
these are the very same important measures advocated by the european parliament in last year's resolution .
it is essential that the government of bangladesh duly follow up on the court rulings .
i have already remarked that the efforts of individual states will not suffice .
a global solution to the problem of ship dismantling is still urgently needed .
with regard to last year's resolution , it is important to add the following five points .
fourthly , certification of dismantling yards is to be welcomed .
i would especially like to thank mr blokland .
finally , bangladesh will start developing a national law on ship breaking in line with the basel convention .
now , let me turn to the situation closer to home by answering your questions .
i share your concerns about the serious risks this presents to human health and the environment .
we considered the question of introducing an eu ban on beaching in the impact assessment of our strategy .
this will encourage the ratification by third countries and consequently speed up the entry into force of this convention .
regarding funding , there is no fund or mechanism for the time being .
on this we are agreed .
the directorate general on competition and the commission have gone straight for litigation .
one last point , which is also crucial we do not want fragmentation of the law .
that is also of decisive importance .
i also believe that parliament is adding a new important element which the commission's proposal has omitted .
the report raises in a balanced way the question of access to the information necessary for bringing follow up actions .
what did they say ?
there are good fundamental reasons for citizens and companies to be able to claim damages .
the division of responsibility between the eu institutions and the member states has been ignored .
there is no objective analysis of what is required by the subsidiarity principle .
the principle is quite simply not taken seriously .
there are also many other unclear points and points that are at risk of being completely arbitrary .
this creates legal uncertainty and will result inforum shopping, which will be a real threat .
the information asymmetry is to be reduced by forcing companies to provide information to the plaintiff .
nor do we want any abuse of the various national regulations in the form of forum shopping .
we definitely want to avoid collective claims in europe along the lines of the us model .
we want to advise as emphatically as possible against unjustified claims and we want to promote alternative settlement procedures .
changes in this regard will promote cross border trade .
last but maybe not least what was said about out of court settlements .
absolutely no question .
you spoke earlier of convergence with the work of the directorate general on competition .
i just want to refer briefly to the question of access to the european commission's files .
the debate is closed .
agenda for next sitting see minutes
much controversy has surrounded the legal basis of the programme .
as we know , the council's legal services challenged the opinion of the commission .
the commissioner can count on the support of parliament in this matter .
the programme confirms that the eu feels responsible for its most needy citizens .
often they are people with disabilities , or even children .
you suggest that storage costs should be covered as well .
i hope ministers have used the waiting time constructively .
we need to put this food aid scheme on a permanent footing for the future .
however , these stocks are being progressively eliminated .
we must help those people in europe who cannot cope on their own with poverty and rejection .
there are many such people in the old eu countries and many more in the new .
is it not paradoxical that we give most of the money in agriculture to those whose production is expensive ?
and all of this is cofinanced in the name of universality .
it would be an indictment of europe if people here in europe had to suffer hunger .
unfortunately , this is not the case at the moment in europe and the world .
i also congratulate the commission for proposing that this assistance should come from the agricultural budget .
the commission proposal can and must , however , be improved .
at present in lithuania about 20 % of residents are considered to be living in poverty .
the commission's proposal really does not match economic realities .
madam president , feeding the hungry is a basic precept .
it is time we ended this waste .
it would be very hard to find a better and more nourishing food .
commissioner , can you speak to the commissioner for fisheries on the extension of this scheme to include fish ?
they withdrew from this scheme many years ago .
such liberalisation has always been to the detriment of fragile populations , fragile producers and fragile areas .
seventy nine million people in the european union were affected by poverty and malnutrition in 200aid has great political significance , because it confirms the cohesion of eu action on behalf of its citizens .
i congratulate mr siekierski on an excellent report .
however , we must ensure a clear allocation of responsibilities .
european agricultural policy is currently facing , and will in future face , great challenges .
the problem , mr stevenson , is that successive common agricultural policy reforms have been greatly reducing the stocks .
likewise , it would seem to be a good idea to extend the programme duration to three years .
in warsaw I see a line of people queuing for a bowl of soup every day .
member states have made huge advances in improving the quality of life of their inhabitants .
it is estimated that 43 million eu citizens are at risk of malnutrition that is a shocking figure .
the distribution programme is helping many of these europeans .
there are two things I would like to ask of the european commission .
as a result of the crisis , in the next few years the situation will only get worse .
survival must definitely be given priority over any other investments , which can wait until better times .
member states that have a social system in place in their own country certainly need not use this scheme .
the programme is open .
the debate is closed .
it is to be feared that the present crisis and rising unemployment will increase that alarming number .
collective redress debate 
this is why we need to find a solution in the interests of justice and a healthy european economy .
business would favour adr mechanisms .
this will not simply be a repetition of the four options in the green paper .
why should reputable businesses suffer at the hands of unfair competitors who profit when consumers are not compensated ?
and I stresscompensated.
i have my mobile phone here .
we must work on this and we wish to pursue this matter further in the coming months .
france , sweden and poland have reported similar cases and injuries .
that is the clear position of parliament , as will become apparent in a few minutes .
i know that is one of your most important preoccupations .
respecting constitutional constraints yes .
white paper on damages actions for breach of the ec antitrust rules 
therefore I ask for a vote in favour of this report .
in doing so we will show that the european parliament is close to the people and their problems .
social responsibility of subcontracting undertakings in production chains 
firstly , that a total of 15 proposals have been amended without sending out any message 
we are in the european union , not the soviet union .
applause 
the report has now been approved by the committee after being adopted by a two thirds majority .
i ask you to reject the two alternative resolutions .
the state of transatlantic relations in the aftermath of the us elections 
since we did not get sufficient guarantees , we also support mr caspary's proposal to postpone these votes .
only the final vote shall be postponed , then .
then we shall stop before the final vote .
before the vote on amendment 2
the oral amendment was accepted 
does that mean that it fell and did not come to the vote at all ?
the food should be chosen by member statesauthorities and distributed in cooperation with civil society partners .
i believe that mr tannock wished to speak .
this had the makings of a great report .
i drew up the opinion in the committee on foreign affairs .
therefore , we had to vote against it , I am afraid to say .
mr president , I extend a very affectionate welcome to your parents , who are present here today .
i hope that the commission will comply with our request and submit a directive .
these are not the aims of a social and free europe .
mr president , I welcome this report as a shot across the bows of supermarket giants .
someone , somewhere , is doing very nicely , but it certainly is not the producer .
retail prices are very different from the prices at which producers sell their products .
we have experienced 100 % price regulation and we well remember what a failure it was .
free price setting is the foundation of freedom and democracy and any attempt to restrict it will lead to totalitarianism .
it has also brought extensive modernisation which has provided consumers with better quality products at lower prices .
basically , then , we cannot establish regulation of food prices along these lines over europe as a whole .
we have to remember that we must ensure that we have good , safe , top quality food .
that is the real signal that must be sent out .
the spanish government needs to act .
this is the game that we came here for .
i consider this totally unacceptable .
fi mr president , transatlantic relations are very important for us europeans .
it is a shame that president pöttering does not somehow follow your example in so many ways in this .
sadly , in this house there are many examples of anti american sentiment .
we also do not wish to be obliged to resettle dangerous terrorists from the guantánamo bay detention camp .
therefore , overall , the british conservatives voted in favour of the millán mon report .
that is one of our fundamental rights and freedoms .
mixing agricultural policy with social policy may be commendable , but it gets complicated .
the views that are put forward in this committee simply to get agricultural products on the market are astounding .
the agricultural budget should not be used to implement social policy .
in writing . the eu is india's top foreign investor and biggest trading partner .
in short , information must be available and transparent and international agreements must be respected .
another important aspect is the idea that the benefits of free trade are mutual .
this will only happen if the barriers to trade and investment in these countries are also reduced .
in my opinion it is therefore frankly unacceptable to sign economic agreements of this kind .
in some member states it is already compulsory for clients to bear full social responsibility for all their subcontractors .
farmers generally receive around 8 % of the final retail price .
this is necessary in order to make european agriculture profitable .
in agriculture , we consider this an important point .
with regard to dumping , action should of course be taken by the competition authority .
neither are we in favour of the committee's proposal formarket management measures.
the prerequisites for comparisons between the member states simply do not exist for numerous different reasons .
it is a terrible problem requiring immediate action from the european union .
in each case , proper legal procedures were followed at the time of the purchase .
the resolution adopted should begin to bring concrete solutions to people living in the affected areas in spain .
in response to such charges procedures are slow and sentences handed down do not provide satisfaction to the victims .
in writing . we voted in favour of the report in sympathy with the complainants .
we also recognise that the treaties explicitly exclude any effect on domestic rules governing the system of property ownership .
i voted in favour .
we must tackle these problems together , with determination and creativity .
the transatlantic link remains essential .
on account of this bias , I voted against this report .
this is essential if we are to be equal to the challenges faced by our civilisation .
moreover , the statements and pronouncements by the new us president himself leave no margin for doubt .
in addition , I have specific objections to aspects of the report dealing with eu defence .
the facts prove the opposite , however .
on the other hand , however , it opens up a wide range of criminal activity .
europe's cultural potential must be used strategically .
aspects relating to culture have been regularly considered in the context of these workshops .
also , as mrs pack has already said , there is the whole question of cultural diversity .
although the world is getting smaller and although people come together more , there are still these significant differences .
although we integrate them and they learn our languages , they are still there with their own separate identities .
madam president , regions are an extremely important place for the development of culture .
economic revival always follows the year of cultural events .
i am glad that this subject has been raised .
in 1841 , according to the census list , there were 1 821 shoemakers within the county .
and what are europe's regions ?
these expressions are stated in more detail in my amendment to the resolution under discussion .
these are elements of production and commerce which serve to meet fundamental needs .
maintaining culture is expensive , and our role is to support culture .
regional culture should therefore be supported if only for this reason .
they share their culture with other regions , and in exchange learn about the accomplishments and achievements of others .
i would , however , like to express some general points and reactions .
the regional dimension will of course be fully taken into account in this context .

the report highlights the need for meaningful dialogue on security matters .
the report indicates the advisability of replacing the current agreement with a new and broader one .
such an agreement should cover all aspects of our cooperation and should be legally binding .
such arrangements could lead to mutually beneficial interdependence .
it is considered very important for russia to abide by the commitments of membership before formally being granted membership .
our support for the territorial integrity of georgia is clearly one of them .
we continue to expect russia to behave responsibly and to honour all its commitments .
we should not be discouraged if it only moves slowly at first .
we are grateful to janusz onyszkiewicz for his report and the recommendations made in it .
it needs to be pursued through both political dialogue and joint initiatives .
given that negotiations are ongoing , it would not be appropriate to give you the details here .
time and again tensions have arisen over the strengthening of our role in the neighbourhood we share with russia .
traditionally , europe has been united with russia .
we cannot permit the creation of new spheres of influence in europe .
we cannot accept the status quo , or rather the fait accompli in the caucasus .
many fellow members today rightly emphasise the need for eu unity in relation to russia .
it is very important that a new partnership and cooperation agreement be worked out and concluded .
the socialist group firmly condemns violations of human rights .
we call upon russia to respect the principle of the independence of the written and electronic media .
the russian law on ngos endangers the independent operation of these organisations .
this report does not serve that purpose .
it was for this reason that we voted against it in the committee on foreign affairs .
so our concern is not with the criticism , but with the style .
it is not didacticism that is needed , but justified criticism .
it is not for the european union to be the schoolmaster and give lessons to russia .
elections , as we know , are no exception .
first , there are those who once sympathised with the soviets and whose sentimental attachment to the kremlin continues .
none of these arguments holds water .
lastly , europe today has a population three and a half times the size of russia's .
this approach is proving remarkably successful .
it follows that europe's weakness in its relations with russia is caused by its own naivety and short sightedness .
if nord stream is implemented , the same fate may befall my country , poland .
the eu's policy towards russia must be based on the principles of unity and solidarity .
all in all it is rather like trying to play football with only one goal .
indeed , europe and russia both face the urgent need for resolute action to tackle the crisis .
priority , therefore , should be given to joint efforts to improve the global economic climate .
another example is last week's renewed imbroglio in ukraine .
i have not only been working on incidents but also keeping an open mind as regards the long term strategy .
we have discussed the many problems involving russia .
let us not forget , however , that concluding a partnership agreement also means being partners ourselves .
they need us and we need them .
the report rightly discusses this .
we have condemned russia's invasion of georgia and continue to do so .
nevertheless , with all due respect to the rapporteur , he would do well to press the reset button .
unfortunately , he has yet to fulfil this promise .
we are striving for a pragmatic partnership with russia , and a partnership agreement is in our interest .
therefore , the core element of the agreement must be energy partnership .
this must not , however , permit us to depart from our principles and values .
thank you .
what is more , many member states depend on russia for energy and have significant trade with it .
unfortunately , the russian leaders now seem to view relations with third countries as a zero sum game .
it is therefore particularly important for the eu to speak with one voice .
we cannot agree to such an approach .
these values are often overlooked in russia , though the value of money is invariably recognised .
which one will have more impact on russia's behaviour ?
russia has no compunction in exploiting such situations .
so the real key is how russia sees power .
today president medvedev is playing a full part in the g20 meeting in london .
for my part , I think it is a terrible document .
we cannot .
i hope that the commission will not accept these recommendations .
this is the area of climate change , one that has so far been tackled mostly by scientists .
russia is a gangster state where troublesome political opponents , dissenters and journalists are simply murdered .
personally I do not want the european union to negotiate agreements with anyone on anything .
i must remind you of what I have actually proposed in my amendments .
our relations now are a lot deeper and more wide ranging than they were only a decade ago .
we should also strengthen the early warning mechanism and make it more operative .
we therefore look forward to remaining in a dialogue with you as the negotiations progress .
this is true for us , but it is also true for russia and for many other global partners .
the new agreement with russia should therefore lay down , as we always say , legally binding reciprocal commitments .
my second point is a general one and relates to the actual nature of the talks .
i should like to point out that this report avoids terms such as strategic partnership .
i welcome janusz onyszkiewicz's report on eu russia relations .
this is the only way in which we can guarantee european citizens gas supply security at affordable prices .
we must make progress in settling unresolved conflicts , such as those in transnistria , ossetia and abkhazia .
whether this actually comes about largely depends on the russian side .
nobody will force russia to make such a choice or indeed any other .
if europe departed from its fundamental values , it could no longer be europe .
acting to the detriment of this world would amount to suicide .
the european parliament's role is to provide active input into the nature and content of the agreement .
the report provides a detailed analysis of the main aspects of the relationship between the eu and russia .
the report refers to a range of problems whose solution is particularly important to individual countries .
problems of this nature can only be resolved if the eu adopts a united stance .
it is also a major energy supplier and an important trading partner .
opening of international negotiations in view of adopting an international treaty for the protection of the arctic debate 
only three eu member states have territories within the arctic region .
this is one of the key elements in the communication .
now , why is this so important ?
we share your concern that the arctic region deserves international attention as never ever before .
this involved consultations with all main arctic stakeholders , including both eu and non eu arctic states .
we want to see these conventions fully implemented and , very importantly , adapted to the arctic specificities .
we want a north pole that is clean and above all without troops .
it is people , as you have already said , that distinguish the arctic from the antarctic .
we should build on the work of the arctic council .
at all costs , we have to avoid a retreat into old style sovereignty , territorial claims and intergovernmentalism .
our group will not therefore support the 50 year moratorium .
the european union wants us to meet our objectives of renewable energy .
well , mr president , colleagues , let me tell you that I agree with mrs wallis .
the arctic is not uninhabitable .
it is not an unregulated landmass like the antarctic .
this will and should happen in cooperation with the arctic states and the arctic peoples .
however , I think that the main approach taken by the resolution is a good one .
it is good that the eu is focussing on the arctic region .
firstly , it is quite unrealistic .
we must remember that .
the call for a responsible approach towards the arctic is an sos and an issue of global governance .
i would just like to recall the council's conclusions from december .
strict environmental management and sustainable use of resources , as well as open and equitable access .
the letter stated that the university was unable to offer her the care she needs .
the report we are discussing today touches the heart of our society .
there are many people I should like to thank for their contribution to the report .
many of her suggestions have been incorporated into the text .
not all distinctions are regarded as discrimination , however .
you do not want to see equal treatment legislation full stop .
i would also like to say a very great thank you to commissioner špidla .
people of a different religion should not be discriminated against .
please vote for it .
the committee on culture and education called for amendments and additions in three areas .
the committee on culture and education votes unanimously in favour of the horizontal framework directive .
the list goes on .
very few countries are familiar with the concept of multiple discrimination .
this woman must have the opportunity to lodge a complaint and obtain redress and justice .
in a free europe , everyone must have the freedom to hold their own convictions .
the buitenweg report rides roughshod over these limits in every respect .
this amounts to the most serious attack ever perpetrated against the credibility of this house .
this matter was particularly safe in her hands .
requirements can be laid down that are necessary for the realisation of the school's purpose and fundamental principles .
the essential question is and remains what on earth has this got to do with europe ?
we need this legislation .
you have stated fantasies , you have not stated reasons .
applause 
that is why tomorrow , I hope and believe , you will be defeated .
no one , therefore , can remain indifferent .
however , the concept itself remains so wide and abstract that some clarification would be desirable .
freedom of opinion where does protection against direct and indirect discrimination begin , and where does it end ?
the head teacher banned it because there were children of other religious faiths present .
what concept do you have of humanity ?
if ever there was a subsidiarity issue , this should be it .
the third reason is that the measures within the directive are disproportionate and inadequately balanced .
unfortunately , the text contains provisions which are unacceptable from the perspective of religious doctrine .
paradoxically , the left intends to discriminate in this way .
in fact , it is me being discriminated against simply because I sincerely believe in god .
indeed , if it did , it would be corrected by the council of ministers .
the answer has to beno.
now is the opportunity for the house to do that which is right and just and good .
he will explain better than I the reasons why he has to do so .
this directive defends human dignity .
we are talking about human dignity and it is the same for everyone .
the first question was about the creation of senseless additional bureaucracy .
this is a typically open formulation which is redefined of course in different specific cases .
i think that the same thing will be happening in your countries .
commissioner špidla has commented on this .
nl mr president , I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur .
it was no easy task .
some fellow members seem to be particularly quick to take offence .
ladies and gentlemen , mr barrot will replace mr špidla for the final part of this debate .
i would say that this report is not left or right it is about fundamental rights .
let us support it .
it is practical and it is right .
the important thing is that we manage to come to a decision .
let us not add further exceptions to those that already exist .
the fight against discrimination is of crucial importance , and represents the bedrock of the european union's values .
let me give you two examples of this .
each member state has constantly persisted in improving equal access to those who need it the most .
i have said that anyone who asks questions is the bad guy in this debate .
all the speakers who have vehemently spoken against discrimination have talked about the principle .
once again I would appreciate it if we could not dispute the principle and instead work to combat discrimination .
that is purely and simply what we are doing here .
frankly , this promise has taken too long to be realised .
you did not do so .
what you really want is the rejection of the entire proposal .
you simply do not want it , so do not pretend you have the same ultimate objective .
for example , a great many people have asked what business this is of europe's .
that is not what this is about at all that was a different directive .
this is not about the employment of teachers .
let us please stick to the facts .
these are the very specific points that are mentioned in the report .
we have accommodated you throughout .
the vote will take place on thursday 2 april 200written statements rule 142 
the discrepancy is even greater if we compare the everyday lives of the people affected .
everybody is different , everybody is equal .
discrimination is a serious problem in europe and beyond .
germany , in particular , has already gone far beyond previous stipulations from brussels .
in this regard I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work .
thus a great deal of effort is still required on our part in order to eliminate discrimination in europe .
this can be the case for women , disabled people , or the long term unemployed .
the revision of the european social fund regulation that we will adopt tomorrow will therefore enter into force immediately .
we must enable these people to be reintegrated into the labour market as quickly as possible .
or should I say what will change when we adopt this tomorrow ?
mr president , I should like to thank mrs garcía pérez , mrs jöns and mr angelakas .
these changes will simplify the expenditure justification procedure .
this is indeed a considerable sum .
let us not forget this fact .
this will have an immediate effect and we will definitely see the initial results in the following months .
what needs to be done ?
commissioner , I along with my colleagues am going to make a proposal to you along these lines .
that is our job .
i would like to make that quite clear .
why is there no commission action plan on regional policy ?
however , we shall be re tabling them and requesting a roll call vote .
on behalf of the gue / ngl group . ga 
mr president , I would like to welcome mr angelakasreport today .
we are struggling with an economic emergency .
that is , assisting people who are spending a high proportion of their income on fuel costs .
it is mostly these people on low incomes who will suffer as our economy worsens .
the economic crisis must not deflect any of us from meeting the long term challenge of climate change .
secondly , I welcome the simplification and flexibility introduced in this proposal . this is badly needed anyway .
while this package will not solve all their problems , it will help .
lv thank you , mr president .
where are the european policies ?
this is just one of the many improvements proposed .
a further important change has so far been overlooked and is called for , however .
we must enable better quality and cheaper housing for everyone , not just for those living in social housing .
they enable member states to optimise eu investments as an effective remedy against the ongoing economic crisis .
checking negligible items often costs much more than the items themselves are worth .
by supporting clean technologies we can contribute to the recovery of both the automobile and construction industries .
we need to look at subsidies and various tax incentives .
these figures are shocking and frightening .
i am sorry that amendments to these reports were not approved .
madam president , I would like to thank the rapporteurs .
the advances , in particular , could be paid out in full at the start of may .
of course , additional proposals could have been included in the framework of the recovery plan .
its work has already led to a draft revision of the commission's implementing regulation .
other proposals to amend the general regulation and regulations specific to each fund may follow .
this crisis is actually causing genuinely difficult situations and poverty for european citizens .
that is my first comment .
i believe that you too will help in this direction and the european parliament will be standing by you .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
it is very important that the four main areas of the european social fund's activities remain the same 
this means that we must work together both in europe and the rest of the world .
we must respond now , together .
they deserve wholehearted support and should be implemented as soon as possible .
the same applies to the simplifying provisions .
lastly , again by implication , a reduction in the cost of residential heating to be paid by citizens .
since joining the eu , renewable energy and energy efficiency have become mandatory targets in romania as well .
madam president , infrastructural development is crucial to our economic recovery .
i welcome recent statements by the commission which detail the disbursement of eu funds to address this huge challenge .
the president cut off the speaker 
this is a 3 % reduction compared to the figures for last year .
only 30 % of those surveyed stated that they intended to vote in the elections .
in my country , no debate whatsoever on europe is taking place .
is everyone else simply to stand and watch ?
therefore our responsibility to find a solution to the problems of extreme poverty has increased exponentially .
this morning there was an explosion at the ananiev tiraspol ismail gas pipeline in transnistria .
i hope that this accident will not have any impact on the outcome of the elections .
at the same time , I believe that it is linked to two particularly important factors .
thank you .
the danube must be given a higher priority within the community's policies .
these women in white fearlessly drew attention to human rights abuses in their country .
it concerns me that the vice president of our parliament was also a member of the delegation .
.
as for the competitiveness of the european shipbuilding industry , it is no better than it used to be .
thank you .
no such country name or event ever existed .
this was during the sixth anniversary of the imprisonment of 75 opposition representatives .
during this visit commissioner michel did not meet with the damas de blanco or any other opposition representatives .
it invites all the parties concerned to mobilise their efforts to bring it to an end .
furthermore , libya must assume its responsibilities as regards the readmission of illegal migrants who have crossed its territory .
i know the problem well .
what is more , all this is taking place in broad daylight , documented by journalists .
how many were there ?
hundreds of migrants have taken the route to exile in inhuman and highly dangerous conditions .
why is that ?
you are right , the people who disappeared at sea are not illegal migrants 
fifthly , to put an end to the restrictive visa policy , which is often arbitrary and unfair 
that is the real cause of the deaths off the coast of libya a few days ago .
does that mean that we should give up on negotiating ?
no !
thank you , sarah , for your close cooperation .
these rules will also be applied in a more harmonised way .
i would of course like to thank mr henrik lax and parliament .
this step is urgently needed in a european union with open borders .
we are also pleased that we have achieved most of our objectives .
that is the way you have approached this in its entirety .
we also have the whole issue of appeal .
without our staff , we could never do the job that we do so well .
it will work with the visa information system , for which I was the rapporteur .
mr lax has done a great job .
the council has agreed to the obligation of the member states to cooperate only .
now , in many member states , such a right does not exist .
we are against such a wide introduction of biometrics .
regrettably , however , the visa fee is unchanged at eur the debate is closed .
the member states must therefore develop specific equipment to monitor the tachograph .
this is one example of the problems encountered by drivers and transport companies .
i need not go into detail about the gravity of accidents involving heavy goods vehicles .
finally , a brief example of the absurdity of the current regulation on driving time and rest periods .
what is more , it took six hours to settle the fine .
thousands of vehicles are standing idle because there are no jobs for them .
the same applies to drivers .
i should like to refer in particular to the eurovignette and to the internalisation of external costs .
i would like to give a little reassurance to those who have expressed the concerns of the profession .
vets have a duty of care and will always try to treat a sick animal .
under present legislation they are often forced to resort to unlicensed medicines .
that same year , the cvmp issued a guideline on the establishment of mrls for minor species .
the risk analysis approach for residues of veterinary medicinal products in food of animal origin .
it is also an important component of the commission's legislative simplification programme .
therefore , we now have a common position of not only the council and parliament but also the commission .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
many of us may think that this report is also of this nature .
for this reason , appropriate regulation for the distinctive features of this branch is needed .
the testing is paid for by the company .
i have been concerned about the studies that have been recently published on the children of migrants .
we also need special investment and additional resources for teacher training and the entire educational system .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
the education of migrantschildren is a step in this direction .
this is precisely why we need to support member states in finding solutions .
this is an absolutely crucial issue , therefore .
i am pleased that virtually all the results of the ep report tally with those of the commission report .
written statements rule 142 
for ten years our parliament had not taken up this issue .
it is this dynamic and progressive definition that we are defending today in this sensitive area of electromagnetic waves .
european citizenship does not replace national citizenship .
the scale of migration , however , poses many challenges for the host countries .
nevertheless , instances of discrimination remain .
the second right I mentioned , that of consular protection , is still , unfortunately , poorly applied .
this is unacceptable for european citizens .
the treaty on the european union states that every citizen of the union is equal .
unfortunately , however , this principle is not always fulfilled in reality .
opening of the sitting
the new ecolabel will take on a new guise in terms of its look and content .
the commission set a target of increasing that to 35 000 participants .
that is a very ambitious target . it is almost a 10 fold increase .
so that kind of change is important .
core indicators will also be introduced .
they will see this kind of initiative by the commission as a distraction .
but I think that is wrong .
the regulation is more flexible and able to meet the new environmental challenges and priorities .
given that it is a framework legislative act , the ecolabel regulation does not set specific criteria for products .
i trust that parliament will fully support this positive bundle of proposals .
my thanks once again to the rapporteurs for their excellent work .
however , the text which we are being called to vote on allays my initial fears .
marketing support for this label has been very limited in the past .
i thank all those who have been involved in the work .
i think that reference is very relevant .
this directive takes an important step in the right direction by simplifying the passage toward getting the ecolabel .
it is very important to analyse the whole life cycle of a product , from production to destruction .
the simple fact of the matter is that we use too much on our planet .
we use resources quicker than they are able to replenish themselves .
we have had a long discussion about foodstuffs and I think that we have arrived at a sensible solution .
and the power of one is perhaps something we have not promoted enough .
this enables people to help the environment directly and to reduce emissions in their everyday living and buying .
labelling is a clear and simple measure to promote energy efficiency , ethical production and development of greener technologies .
it also provides means to reduce animal testing and child labour .
ireland and europe can benefit by further promoting and using the scheme .
the other crucial factor is that the label should only be for environmentally superior products .
another important issue in the debate was whether the ecolabel might be extended to food .
the regulation is a first step .
what does environmental sustainability mean for the ecolabel , though ?
all this amounts to nothing less than a revolution .
but on a note of caution the european parliament's control over this will be particularly unbending .
congratulations again to the rapporteur for his excellent report .
this in turn should give the system greater authority by encouraging application on a broader , more global scale .
we must , however , improve communication .
first revision of the emas scheme was not encouraging .
the rapporteur , mrs mcavan , added valuable additional modifications .
it would help organisations to proceed more easily from iso to emas standards .
an impartial system of certification will be , we suppose , appreciated also by consumers .
this is a real improvement .
this declaration also clarifies that the ecolabel will be complementary to the specific fishery products regulation .
i have already suggested to the institution's management to join this scheme as soon as possible .
i also think it is right that we will be retaining the voluntary nature of the scheme in future .
it would be a great shame if the establishment of the ecolabel were to fail due to bureaucratic obstacles .
one symbol , one conclusion that is what we should all be working towards together .
i thank him for preparing the report , and I thank you for listening to me .
for the time being its popularity lags behind the international iso 14001 standard .
in my opinion , both reports contribute to movement in this direction .
this requires unambiguous criteria , of course .
eventually , only the top 10 % to 20 % of products per category can be awarded the ecolabel .
introducing the system will contribute to an improvement in the state of the environment and will counteract climate changes .
it will also contribute to a reduction in water consumption .
if it is in it , it must say so , and what it says must be correct .
we should demonstrate that europe exerts itself on specific concerns and delivers exceptionally well on them .
the commission and member states must ensure that the necessary funds are earmarked for ecolabel awareness and promotion campaigns .
if we want this scheme to be effective it must not be accompanied by an increase in red tape .
thank you .
the third statement concerns the commission's plan to re examine the level of duty on ecolabel products .
i should therefore like to stress once again the importance of reaching agreement at first reading .
numerous useful changes have been made to the texts and the results are very balanced .
i therefore call on you to support this text in its entirety without further change .
2 in relation to coherence with chemicals legislation
that is a job for next time .
i look forward to the vote , which I hope will be a very simple , straightforward one .
the debate is closed .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting see minutes
thank you very much .
parliament's will is always decisive .
we will consider what you had to say in the next meeting of the bureau .
we will take care of this matter .
on behalf of the whole of parliament , I wish the delegation a very warm welcome !

applause 
i would therefore be grateful for a postponement .
member of the commission . we do not object to the postponement .
bi annual evaluation of the eu belarus dialogue vote 
i would not like to delete the truth now .
interjection from the floor 
pl mr president , I would just like to add that I also signed the resolution .
i would therefore ask you to add my name .
opening of international negotiations in view of adopting an international treaty for the protection of the arctic vote 
i do so on foot of what commissioner ferrero waldner said here last night in the debate .
applause 
health concerns associated with electromagnetic fields 
better schools an agenda for european cooperation 
the next item is voting time .
our education systems should not have to be adapted to the cultures of other peoples .
it will not surprise you to learn that I am resolutely in favour of the first of these arrangements .
in fact , european citizenship is highly artificial in nature .
the rapporteur regrets above all that the citizens are unaware of the rights that it would give them .
it should not be diverted and it should not be shared .
i reject that philosophy as I reject the lisbon treaty .
mr president , I am not , first and foremost , a european union citizen .
but I have no difficulty with the wordssubjectsandcitizens.
focusing on cohesion policy is a sensible way for us to fulfil our obligation to communities and economies .
i will give poland as an example .
first of all , we all accept some discrimination .
i support that .
of course we are all against discrimination .
it is right that we correct that anomaly .
above all , it bears witness to exceptional levels of distrust in respect of the member states themselves .
anti discrimination legislation of this kind is not a refinement of the principle of equality under the law .
i will mention two examples .
for that reason I voted against mrs buitenweg's report today .
i do not believe there is any need for european legislation in these matters .
the document breaches the principle of subsidiarity , which is becoming an increasingly common practice in the european parliament .
actually , it is the most we can do in this house together in the name of justice .
we owe our parents and grandparents a firm parliamentary message , and that is what we have produced today .
it is here , my friends , that you make your bloomer .
now of course , one has to be careful making such parallels .
there were two interesting sentences in the report that merit further attention .
we should be careful it is not the first step towards totalitarianism .
unfortunately it also imprisoned history and its documents .
millions of pages of history have been kept hidden in the secret archives that still exist in moscow .
however , we believe that majority decisions by parliament are not competent to interpret historic facts .
the evaluation of historic facts is the job of historians and historians alone .
my friends , culture cannot be created by bureaucratic fiat .
it is time for action .
those steps undermine the territorial integrity of georgia as insisted upon in the relevant united nations resolutions .
i have voted in favour of mr varvitsiotis's report on the mutual recognition to decisions on supervision measures .
this is the first and a fundamental step towards full integration into society .
the integration of migrants , whether residing legally or illegally , is a priority for us socialists .
that is simply contrary to the international conventions .
i think the answer lies in the paragraph quoted above .
i can only admire the opportunistic hypocrisy of my tory colleagues .
we believe that actions should be taken to assist all vulnerable pupils .
concentrations of foreigners of 20 , 50 or even 90 % show that the multicultural vision has failed .
many children of romanian immigrants , for instance , face difficulties in this respect .
at this very moment , romania , for example , is going through an experience which reflects this .
it is typical and unacceptable that the report refers solely to the children of legal immigrants .
we do not accept the hierarchy that the parliamentary right wishes to create amongst migrants .
mother and father are the most important people for a child .
we share the report's overarching idea of improved european citizenship and improved freedom of movement .
for example , the ep 
this is a serious attack on national identity and cohesion .
their objective is to lead the workers , especially young people , up an ideological garden path .
the workers can and will send this message through the ballot box during the european elections in june .
i decided to vote against mrs gacek's report on problems and prospects concerning european citizenship .
i agree with the aim , but not with the methods .
i would tackle the root of the problem , which actually lies in other matters .
interventions should target low income households , as defined by the national legislation in force .
the mass legalisations of recent decades also cast doubt on whether it is sensible to proceed with harmonisation .
this will facilitate movement of citizens and also of workers between countries both within and without the community .
i voted in favour of mr tatarella's report on a community ecolabel scheme .
emas was first introduced in 1995 and was extended in 2001 to both public and private sector organisations .
combating discrimination of all kinds and bringing about participation in public life by the disabled are important jobs .
we therefore voted against this report .
i do not think so .
then the principle of equality may as well be done away with completely .
i was pleased to support it .
it has broad support from social platforms and civil society .
matters of marital or family status
the secular nature of the state and its institutions
i therefore welcome this report , which urges a further strengthening of provisions to enforce such equality .
we rightly have restrictions on freedom of speech covered by the laws of libel and slander .
the pitfalls in such a coercive regulation are legion .
in the name of equality , the censors and the dictators are here present .
the reality of daily life shows that much progress remains to be made in the member states .
the offensive remarks about the elderly that continue unabated are an eloquent illustration of this .
however , I am unable to subscribe to the pathways and options described in this report .
however , legislation in this area must be well thought out .
the cda is opposed to the proposal to reverse the burden of proof .
i have met with and been lobbied by many disability interest groups who asked for consideration of their position .
at council many member states have also voiced concerns about the proposal .
this amendment was rejected by the house and therefore I abstained in the final vote .
in such cases my party , the dutch socialist party , objects .
discrimination on the basis of ethnic or racial origin is forbidden both in the labour market and outside it .
the lobby made a hostage of genuine discrimination when it added sexual orientation and religion or belief .
these forms of discrimination have never been defined in any eu documents .
the consequences may be dramatic .
non discrimination based on belief is also problematic .
insurance premiums will become more expensive .
it is far too early to be entering into any kind of normal dialogue with belarus .
would any of the eu countries agree to such conditions ?
they must not be held ashostagesby the authorities .
i refuse to create a hierarchy of suffering .
we did vote in favour of the resolution as a whole , however .
we condemn the atrocities of both nazism and stalinism .
to others , it was about maintaining traditions , inequality , positions of power and privileges .
nobody remembers their causes , but everyone remembers their means .
that era must absolutely remain in the past .
even though I do not agree with the wording in places , I think this resolution is essential .
this is an important element in our history .
every ideology which does not respect human dignity and human life deserves condemnation and is fundamentally unacceptable .
nazism and communism are ideologies that were actually inspired by older ideologies .
we must particularly emphasise this at the current time , which is an uncertain and exceptionally difficult period .
this resolution discusses issues which lie outside the european union's competence .
consequently , we voted against this report .
we have common interests like fighting nuclear proliferation and building peace in the middle east .
the state of democracy and the rule of law in russia remains of concern .
our partnership with russia must therefore be strong and durable , but it cannot be unconditional .
for our part , we reject this type of relationship out of hand .
i therefore believe that both parties must make more effort to achieve this aim .
however we cannot allow russia to bully its neighbours and use its hydrocarbon resources as a diplomatic weapon .
the waiting lists of maltese and gozitans in need of medical tests and surgical interventions are unbelievable .
2 per cent of the population is waiting for cataract operations .
the 1999 recommendation requires an update within five years of it being published that takes into account ongoing research .
no update has taken place .
due to the ever changing nature of this field , we need to re evaluate the regulations protecting our citizens .
i voted in favour of mrs ries's report on health concerns associated with electromagnetic fields .
member states are responsible for the organisation , content and reform of school education.
that much I agree with .
i vote in favour of a slimmer but more focused eu .
in writing . I voted in favour of the schmitt report on better schools .
this common diagnosis is necessary , if only because of the huge migration taking place within the community .
it is a solid foundation .
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
it is therefore with a twinge of sorrow that I declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .
up to 40 000 people were made homeless by the main quake and numerous aftershocks .
i would ask you to rise from your seats in silent remembrance .

it is finally time to take a decision .
wednesday 
on behalf of all the signatories , I call for this situation to be remedied .
have I now suddenly come up against another sort of earthquake ?
mrs lulling , the president does not make this decision alone , I follow the rules of procedure .
the decisive factor is rule 132 , by which we are bound .
the next item is the one minute speeches on matters of political importance .
the multilateral trade finance package adopted in london by g20 is without doubt a positive move .
over 20 people , including children , were burned alive in a building .
there was no kidnapping , either on 9 april or ever .
this industrial action brought very serious disruptions to flows of freight through this vital trans european route .
any lenience on our part would cast a shadow over eu credibility in this respect .
again , eu credibility and authority are at stake .
sometimes things seem different here .
i only heard the last 10 words .
mr president , after 36 years of membership , what has the european union meant for britain ?
eu membership is a disaster for britain .
de mr president , yesterday the united nationsanti racism conference opened in geneva .
this shows the unity of the european union in relation to such an important event in a poor light .
france is also approaching this proportion .
more than a third of the members of the german government are women .
in fact , 30 % have no intention of participating in the forthcoming elections .
the millions that have been spent on communications with the citizens have been to no avail .
what is particularly frustrating for me is that the promised election awareness advertisement has spectacularly backfired .
this needs to be visible and easily understood .
any power which is afraid of the press will first strike against them .
it is time for us to take stock of the situation .
an eu backed report has recently concluded that up to 125 million citizens are affected by energy poverty .
let me first emphasise the increased forms of accountability that we have negotiated .
finally , we have introduced requirements for streamlined decision taking .
regarding the overall package , as it has been negotiated , parliament can be proud of the final text .
moreover , an a class tyre is more cost effective in the long run .
this corresponds to removing the co2 emission from near enough one million passenger cars on european roads .
i should like to conclude with a word about the time frame .
the tool to achieve this goal is the third internal energy market package for gas and electricity .
today we are close to the adoption of this package and thus to achieving this goal .
the commission fully supports this compromise .
the compromise reached also strikes a good balance between the positions of parliament and the council .
a lot of companies have restructured their business and how they deal with networks and consumers .
the discussions and proposals demonstrate that parliament shares the policy objectives and wishes to vigorously improve current performance .
it is important that we find the best way of displaying the label .
there is some discussion on this .
i would like to thank all those involved and particularly all members of the european parliament that supported this .
madam president , thank you mr piebalgs for your focussed speech .
but that would hinder and damage all the things that we can achieve by an open electricity market .
fortunately , however , summing this third package up as ownership unbundling would be a mistake .
this will be a cartel , and to face this cartel we need stricter laws .
this is very important for small eu member states .
not everything concerning the agency for the cooperation of energy regulators was brought to a conclusion .
for example , the issue of its headquarters remains open .
we did not agree as to the instruments with which we can best achieve this .
which sources of energy will best limit the greenhouse effect and reduce the costs of its control ?
we were faced with two important problems .
secondly , the principle of open competition in the european energy market .
the revival of the energy performance of buildings sector , except for a striking reduction ..
we have a lot of work ahead of us .
energy poverty has become a serious issue .
for that reason we are making energy a public service with this legislative package .
let us make further headway along this route .
legislation such as this will ensure our manufacturers become world leaders in the technology we so urgently need .
tyres are not cheap , yet most individual buyers are forced into uniform purchases .
this information will help make the move towards goods that reduce emissions as well as noise pollution .
i am pleased that we have reached agreement on this extensive and professionally demanding dossier .
a key task is to increase the generating capacity of european power stations and develop the cross border network .
de madam president , commissioner , I would like to congratulate you on this package in particular .
there is no ideal legislation .
we can be really proud of it .
rapporteur . madam president , I would like to thank colleagues once again for their cooperation .
it is far from perfect but it is definitely a step forward .
but there is a huge amount more to do .
what we have at the moment is the worst of both worlds .
i would like to pick up one or two points that have come up in the debate .
should we come back for a fourth package ?
market forces are already moving in this direction .
that is why it is a good thing to do .
the debate is closed .
today nearly 100 million people live in prefabricated buildings .
money should be found for this purpose as part of the mid term review of the 2007 2013 financial framework .
however , the market price of energy is only one side of the problem .
there is a significant , additional financial burden on consumers due to energy market inefficiencies and distortions .
better standard of transparency and rationality governing price increases as well as better access and information regarding consumer rights .
at the same time , I welcome that the council's compromise reflects parliament's numerous consumer protection proposals .
planners and building inspectors will receive appropriate guidance from this directive .
the targets for buildings with zero net energy consumption constitute a significant part of the reworked directive .
that option is now extended to all member states .
we , the european community , have set ourselves a very ambitious task .
in saying this , I would like to express my support for the rapporteur .
finally , it is important for workers abroad wanting to hear their children's voice on the phone .
the only option for consumers is to choose not to communicate by mobile phone .
furthermore , in some countries the cost of installing and operating mobile phone networks is higher .
this is why the regulation stipulates that the european commission must analyse different means of regulating the market .
we have made guidelines more transparent on advising customers about roaming mobile internet access .
we have reduced the maximum tariffs for calls received and made , while maintaining a profit margin for operators .
that is why I thank the european parliament for having so swiftly responded to the commission's proposal .
we now have an average penetration rate in europe of 119 % .
it also gives good money to the industry because their traffic is rising continuously .
now we are going a step further firstly , of course , on voice roaming .
the value of the revenue from this for the industry is roughly eur 800 million .
and for data roaming , where we believe that this is a future development .
i think the people outside will understand that this parliament works for the citizen .
i am pleased that we did not have any differing points of view on this occasion .
in fact , we have all quickly adopted this tariff reduction .
citizens should , therefore , have extensive and easy access to telecommunications services .
in this regard I value highly the work of the commission and the commissioner .
this is important , because this matter in large measure concerns the youngest group in our society .
pl mr president , commissioner , I am pleased with the direction in which we are moving .
i am referring to the radical price reductions in voice roaming calls and internet access .
this is the first step , and I think that others will follow .
this news will certainly be received gladly .
i would like to thank the commission .
it is a great moment which shows to citizens that meps are taking them seriously .
how we should regulate it is a matter which we can still discuss .
i would like to say a final word to this industry as a whole .
we must not allow the perception to be conveyed that the mobile phone sector ruthlessly exploits consumers .
it had limited resources with which to tackle the scale of the task to be accomplished .
another very important matter is the difference between words and deeds when preparing agreements .
drawing up and signing cause a great deal of ambiguity .
finally , I would like to thank the commissioner for his cooperation during this term of office .
the next speaker will be mr fjellner .
mr president , I am impressed that you at least attempted to list all of these decentralised agencies .
in 2007 , the budget for all the agencies was eur 1 243 500 000 .
staff numbers have increased just as dramatically .
in 1995 , 38 people , on average , worked in each agency .
therefore we are not yet able to grant it discharge .
we need to have all the information on the table before we can grant discharge .
in the draft resolution before you paragraph 58 , the rapporteur .
so there was too much carrot and too little stick initially .
we have also pursued evolution rather than revolution .
obviously , five years for our action plan was not enough .
but your question is ,how and when can you guarantee a positive das ? 
first , I should remind honourable members what the so callednegative dasis .
so we must do something to end this damaging political assessment of the use of european funds .
for urgent , more guaranteed results , one could imagine three options 
we contacted several national delegations they all agreed nobody acted .
there are millions of transactions to check .
it means reducing the number of transactions from millions to a few thousand .
this is the discussion about tolerable risk .
the council also now seems ready to engage .
the eu was created to bring peace and prosperity .
but audit perfection is a rare phenomenon anywhere in the world .
in general we think that there is visible progress and we are going to support granting the commission discharge .
cooperation and communication are important tools and we often witness the results of omissions in this respect .
we will continue the discussion .
the image conveyed to citizens by our parliament and by the european union in general is very important .
we need to manage crises on our own and not to transfer this ability to other bodies .
it is unfortunate that these came at the end of the period .
it is very harmful to public opinion if the situation of a negative das is sustained year after year .
the committee's excellent reports clearly reveal the serious shortcomings that exist .
allow me to quote from one of these reports .
the eu member states must finance themselves and not tax their neighbours .
what is now happening to this voluntary pension fund has been thrown out by the eurosceptics .
what is happening is unethical and we have to take action against it .
the european development fund enables us to combat poverty , while promoting economic development and democracy .
so thank you all for this contribution to the complicated discharge machinery .
the member states are responsible because they are not applying the regulations with enough rigour .
parliament is responsible because it must be clear about the current imperfections and must accept the reforms .
however , there is something , mr president , that I do not understand .
mr ferber has already mentioned this point .
we need the cooperation and constructive ideas that we have developed over recent years .
we established a statute for assistants and we were also criticised for this .
we need a european model .
i am very pleased to be chairman of this committee .
the vote will take place on thursday 23 april 200written statements rule 142 
the agency for fundamental rights ,
de facto , their transposition into binding community legislation would bring legal certainty .
moreover , close cooperation with the international atomic energy agency has ensured consistency with international practices .
it has absolutely nothing to deliver in this regard .
we have a duty to do that .
i repeat we demand transparency , and we want clear and rigorous legislation .
i am grateful to our rapporteur , mr hökmark .
it was not easy to achieve this .
we also worked together with the council , which had discussed more or less the same proposals in 200it is the national regulators who are responsible for the safety of the installations running in their countries .
in my view , it is important that we can lay the ground for having more nuclear power plants .
in writing . I would like to draw my attention to the environmental situation of marsaxloqq bay .
this has had a health impact on the residents in its region especially those of marsaxloqq .
deforestation has now become a major issue at international negotiations , on both climate change and biodiversity .
this proposal is already being discussed and processed at the international negotiations on climate change currently under way .
the proposed measures include the following 
these undertakings will also be implemented through the european commission's policy on sustainable consumption and production .
the core element of the above action plan was the conclusion of voluntary partnership agreements with third country timber producers .
we believe that the agreements in question may help to address the basic causes of illegal logging .
this ban was included in the options examined by the commission when it drafted its proposal .
however , while this approach is quite attractive at first sight , it presents important practical and political difficulties .
sadly , however , the painfully slow rate of progress in the council has put paid to that idea .
this means that the european union must assume a leading role in formulating a global political response .
part of the auction revenues resulting from the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions must be earmarked for halting deforestation .
the illegal logging regulation does not aim to punish or to hinder trade but rather to better control trade .
it is true that the commission proposals were not really clear on how the system should work in practice .
it is important to underline that tackling global deforestation and forest degradation is a complex issue .
i wish to thank again ms lucas , mr ford and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent work .
i think it is much more sensible that everybody has a role to play .
i would also add that many elements of our proposals are actually supported by industry .
the joint debate is closed .
in fact , the commission has condemned this situation recently .
under the cfp , control and enforcement are the exclusive competence of the member states .
it will also facilitate cross checking of data and information , and the identification of risks .
on transhipments of stocks subject to multiannual plans , amendment 42 deletes the entire article amendment 47 deletes the entire section on real time closure of fisheries .
real time closures are directly linked to control issues .
therefore , this amendment cannot be accepted .
in the same vein , amendment 61 cannot be accepted .
to introduce such a rule additionally in the context of the penalty point system would be disproportionate .
by not providing an official , the member state concerned could even prevent an autonomous inspection from taking place .
this would seriously undermine the capacity of the commission to apply this measure .
evidenceof non respect will be much harder to prove thanreason to believe.
in the same vein , the commission cannot accept amendment 113 , which proposes to delete this article .
amendments 74 to 78 reduce substantially the pressure on member states to respect national quotas .
this report is a significant contribution to a truly efficient control system .
i mention here article 47 of the control regulation , at least in its original version .
there are over one million of us in britain we are conservation minded we are sensible .
if you get this power , you can come back year after year .
we should be recognising as the americans have done the enormous economic impact that it can have .
we have regulated their fishing since 1983 , so for 26 years .
what is more , it is still not working .
that is the path , mr president , that brussels must also take .
we do not need this at the centre of it .
on article 47 , recreational fishing , I welcome the definition , which was missing in the draft proposal .
it must be the exception and not the rule .
get the balance right , please , commissioner borg .
pt mr president , commissioner , your proposal is absolutely fundamental .
however , I should also like to say that I am in favour of subsidiarity .
clearly we are equally strongly aware of the need for a meaningful reform of our control systems .
i said that we are prepared to accept the definition that is proposed in one of the amendments .
we have a significant problem with recovery stock .
interjection from the floor no science for that at all !
i myself took part in such a conference in scotland some time ago .
this is the reason why there is no general exemption for this fleet in the proposal .
taking the margin of tolerance as an example , I agree with the commission that 5 % was sufficient .
i believe that it was indeed vitally urgent to simplify the legislative framework in this respect .
you were always available for us .
it has been much appreciated and noted and the comparison made with other commissionersavailability .
in my view , this is a matter of interest and one that should be debated .
we are more restrictive than you tend to be .
the debate is closed .
rather , it wants a coherent one , because only a coherent policy can be effective .
common sense prevailed over intransigence and respect for the law reigned over the law of the jungle .
this was not something I could accept .
next month , the commission will propose means by which the implementation of this pact can be monitored .
this will take place through an annual report that will be issued by the commission .
in various parts the busuttil report urges the commission to take action .
according to eurostat , population ageing in the eu will become a reality in the medium term .
immigration could act as an important stimulus to ensure good economic performance in the eu .
illegal work needs to be tackled given that it fundamentally violates the rights of migrant workers .
bad management of migration may have serious consequences for the countries of origin and for the immigrants themselves .
allow me to elaborate on some of the issues raised in the report .
civil society organisations are now more actively involved in the development and the initiation of projects .
the vote will take place on wednesday 22 april 200effective enforcement of judgments in the eu the transparency of debtorsassets short presentation 
small businesses are affected disproportionately by people defaulting on payments .
thanks must also go to colleagues from other groups who have made very constructive suggestions .
what is key , I believe , is for this legislation to be brought forward as soon as possible .
i would also like to thank ms gill for the report .
furthermore , this is key for the survival of small businesses in the current economic climate .
the item is closed .
this committee that I sit on is a peculiar committee of parliament .
we have called for the commission to take action in this regard .
i think that is extremely important .
in recent years women's dignity and calling have taken on a new dimension .
at the general directorate level the representation of women is still insufficient .
i would especially like to thank my fellow members on the various committees who were responsible for this work .
the model is described in detail in the explanatory statement .
gender equality is one of the basic principles of community law .
women represent 52 % of the european population .
it has adopted many reports and opinions which deserve more attention from the other committees in parliament .
for this reason too the numbers of women meps should increase a one third to a half .
nowadays , there is an ever increasing number of women becoming involved in politics and making major decisions in companies .
this has been ignored in the past .
this relates to software rather than hardware .
it now needs to be adjusted to new challenges .
the item is closed .
the final stage of integrating the network should place greater emphasis on the financing of its cross border elements .
agenda for next sitting see minutes
the recent conclusions of the g20 have further strengthened this determination .
such an initiative is all the more important now during the period of crisis we are going through .
it is , of course , something which we are coming back to .
i will just finish on this one note .
these will be discussed by the heads of state or government in june .
the situation in the eu financial sector is serious .
all g20 members have agreed on regulating credit rating agencies through the introduction of mandatory registration and oversight regime .
however , I also have to admit that I am disappointed with certain aspects of the compromise .
i now turn to the weber report .
ten times , I repeat .
in the current difficult and challenging economic situation we cannot afford such impediments .
this is not 193we did not have the institutions or the capability of addressing things that we have now .
i do not see this coming from the european council and it is time it did .
the outcome of this kind of self regulation is clear for all to see , and it is terrible .
now is the time to take courage and build a new structure for the financial markets .
one good thing is that there is to be only one rating category .
there are no comparable rules in any other eu regulation .
what to do with this enormous debt that has built up by granting credit without guarantees ?
speeches about action do not guarantee that the action will be effective .
we do not agree with the compromise that is proposed and that rejects the system of group supervision .
we believe this to be irresponsible .
time will tell whether member statessupervisory authorities have sufficient capacity to understand these models .
nobody understands it least of all the fsa .
frankly , I think you are going to get on really well with each other .
madam president , I am pleased that solvency ii has at last reached the point of decision .
i am glad the scope is restricted to ratings used for regulatory purposes .
the president cut off the speaker 
to prevent any further crisis , we obviously need to be much more ambitious and more pro active .
that is all for now .
the fall out of all of this for workers and families across europe has been nothing short of catastrophic .
when the risks become reality , the management have got their money and the losses are borne by others .
rating agencies know that they will not get the work if they question the solvency of their clients .
we are spurred on by the need to adopt joint european responses and take a global lead .
another stage is being completed , and further chapters must be tackled or completed without delay .
the banking directive is due for adoption in may .
nevertheless the g20 found ideal culprits tax havens , whether real or not .
the g20 intends to regulate only speculative funds that pose a systemic risk .
solvency ii was long overdue I wish to start by setting this aside .
what mr gauzès has now negotiated is useful .
first of all , there is no point in trying to solve yesterday's problems .
this is exactly why we have introduced such a process in the lamfalussy procedure , which we developed recently .
secondly , we should consider the level that is under scrutiny .
as it happens , the rating agencies allowed for this .
this also means that these guest supervisors refuse to transfer powers to supervisors who play first fiddle .
we need greater openness and transparency on the market , greater opportunities to act across borders and improved supervision .
however , we must take care not to over regulate , which is a risk in the current mood .
let us not forget that the market economy creates prosperity .
from the sale of 400 tonnes of gold ?
so europe is reacting , albeit slowly , but better late than never .
this , of course , leaves two major questions which need to be answered .
but I would like to point out two pitfalls here .
for this reason , I support the measures , even though we will have to go further .
parliament will monitor and promote its development .
the de larosière group report and the turner report , too , have made this quite clear .
these reports are in analytical tune with the lamfalussy follow up report of parliament .
de madam president , three brief points are important in my eyes .
what have you been doing since then , commissioner ?
of course , this is not the end of the story .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , I shall limit myself to two or three brief remarks .
certainly , but let us vote on this and work in the right direction .
i have to say that without their work and their help , we would not have achieved this .
let us hope that we can get that back .
capital is defined as well .
my second point is about the strategic impact of using such legislation .
the joint debate is closed .
i do not wish to discuss here the importance of rating agencies .
we need new organisations in this sector , which will generate competition in providing objective ratings .
we must think about protection for the investors and their confidence in rating agencies .
the eu must guarantee that rating agencies operate according to clear regulations .
the next item is the joint debate on 
generally speaking , the commission carries out this work in harmony with the imf .
member of the commission . I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague , mr almunia .
the council has announced that it will not be making a statement .
this topic is being tabled for discussion for a second time within a short period .
how did such an immoral action occur to you , together with the spineless hungarian government ?
thank you .
yes , mr mccreevy , please ?
please ?
as you know , the procedure comprises two stages .
this means we have a dual instrument .
europe has contributed to increasing this funding whilst also assuming its own responsibility .
therefore , the limit of eur 50 billion is completely justifiable at present .
if new challenges should present themselves , we shall not be able to close our eyes to them .
this will be less expensive and will give the european union greater stability .
we will become victims of the crisis if we are unable to take quick , effective action .
this applies to my country , hungary , and to every other country too .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on friday 24 april .
agreement between the ec and pakistan on certain aspects of air services 
trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products 
coordination of social security systems 
rapporteur . nl I can be very brief .
we discussed the first reading of this dossier less than a year ago .
we managed to work well with the european commission .
i should like to leave it there .
this is the regulation to which that refers , and this is the implementation of it .
this will introduce substantial europeanisation into the important field of measurement .
each amounts to eur 200 million , and this will enable us to achieve cooperation between the nation states .
so , then , I wish to reiterate my particular thanks to everyone involved .

in the commission's view , these measures could also include the suspension of the agreements .
the latter is a fundamental principle for trade agreements made by the european union .
that was all that could be hoped for .
common immigration policy for europe principles , actions and tools 
green paper on the future of ten t policy 
i am particularly pleased that we are joined by czech minister for foreign affairs , mr karel schwarzenberg .
the time for protectionism is over .
this is what we should also be aiming for in the case of tyres .
in this matter we need to find the right sort of balance .
that would be in the interests of the public .
the level for regular roamers is much lower .
this is , in other words , a tax on non travellers for the benefit of travellers .
who has the power , and over whom does he wield it ?
i would also like to point out that these roaming tariffs have been very unclear .
this european approved response is a good example of a closer relationship on financial cooperation .
but it is good to have him in the centurion club .
i voted for the hökmark report for all sorts of reasons .
mainly because , well , who could be against nuclear safety ?
i am therefore glad that , today , amendment 48 has been approved .
it is a shame no one from the council is here to answer that question .
this is something we do not agree with , and we also voted against it at committee level .
the tools ?
what is europe to do ?
europe must wake up and regulate immigration flows seriously we cannot go on like this !
the current regulation , which this report also regulates , is not sufficient to protect coastal fishing .
in writing . it I am voting in favour .
i was the draftsman for the opinion of the international trade committee which was adopted unanimously in committee .
i am pleased that operators will also have to comply with sustainability criteria and laws on indigenous peoples .
in this respect the possession of reserves is a matter of basic national security .
i voted for the proposal for a critical infrastructure warning information network ciwin .
i should like to point out the following in this connection 
my constituents will see the benefit of this legislation in cuts to their bills .
however , I voted for the internal market gas and electricity package because 
i remain uneasy about the non binding nature of the eu agency for the cooperation of energy regulators .
i congratulate parliament on pushing the member states to go further than they wanted to go .
this is another example of parliament guaranteeing the victory of the broader european cause over national self interest and protectionism .
i have therefore voted against the proposal tabled by the committee .
previous experience of labelling , in particular , gives cause for careful consideration .
we need tyres to be safer , more fuel efficient and quieter .
in writing . lt I agree that the regulation of voice call prices should be continued .
i believe that the market should define its own prices in accordance with the basic principles of healthy competition .
the directive strengthens the position of the european monopolies in relation to their international competitors .
whether they are used for business or private purposes is of secondary importance .
it is for that reason that I have voted in favour of this report .
i therefore voted for this report .
we already have price regulation in place as a result of the roaming I regulation .
the result has been that operators cluster around this price ceiling , which does not benefit consumers .
the cost of data transmission will also be reduced , to eur 0.50 per megabyte in 20i definitely endorse the report .
i therefore voted for this report .
that is why we voted against .
in 2009 , it has already been announced that 225 will go .
secondly , the activities of recreational fishermen do not affect stocks to any great extent .
we believe that in the national interest the immigration pact was not satisfactory 
i voted for adoption of the busuttil report .
it is an important report , because migration is one of the most significant challenges facing the european union .
by sending them back to their country of origin we may in fact be sentencing them to death .
thank you very much .
the right of asylum is to become a vehicle for mass immigration on an unprecedented scale .
the current economic crisis may once again encourage us to follow this logic when investing in transport infrastructure .
a team of eight national and commission experts was selected .
thank you , mr kallas .
the figure could amount to eur 500 million , as commission vice president antonio tajani told the press .
these have been difficult days , further aggravated by the weather conditions of the last 48 hours .
everything must be done in close collaboration with the italian authorities .
we will do whatever is possible to help people in this disaster area .
is it because we suspect some fraud or irregularity ?
so why , then , have we done it ?
as representatives of the european taxpayer , we have the task of ensuring compliance with this agreement .
for example how many accounts outside the budget did the council have in 2007 ?
that is what we want today and that is what we want after the elections in june .
those are not audited .
they have refused to give us papers .
they have refused to give us documents .
the first is the credibility and the role of our own parliament .
it is very important to say , from the outset , what parliament can and cannot do .
so we are not saying we want to do something else .
the third reason is the respect and the preparation for the lisbon treaty .
the last and probably the most important point is transparency vis à vis the citizens .
so for those four important reasons of principle , we believe that we must vote in favour of postponement .
it is also based on references to documents and the eu treaty .
its task is also to oversee the use of funds and the budget's general implementation .
indeed , as things stand at the moment , we refuse to grant an extension .
hence the justified demands for an activities report , transparency and clarity .
what do these accounts contain ?
our job as members of the european parliament is to scrutinise the council's use of budget resources .
this we do because we represent the taxpayers .
how many confidential accounts are there ?
we therefore have no transparency .
this is not democracy .
then there is the use of funds .
de mr president , I should like to say two things on behalf of this committee .
congratulations to the rapporteur , who asked straightforward questions and received no answers .
the problems lie in the capital cities , not brussels .
we are a europe of citizens .
we have to be accountable to everyone .
i was mentioned by name I was accused of making nonsensical remarks .
i firmly reject this accusation .
de mr president , mr martin has just addressed me in a most outrageous way .
secondly , I should like to raise an objection to the comparison of the council with the mafia .
this is something that simply cannot be said in a proper democracy .
finally , I would like to thank the committee for the excellent work it has done .
much attention has been paid .
ah , the council has arrived !
perhaps we can start the discussion all over again !
the council is , of course , welcome , but they have come for the next debate .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on
they must prove their reliability throughout europe , and must also have a sound financial structure .
transport managers should be able to demonstrate either many yearsexperience or a high level of training .
these lead to distortions of competition and weaken national undertakings .
the reintroduction of the possibility of taking a weekly rest period after 12 days does not compromise safety .
we are awaiting proposals from the commission on this , as cabotage should also serve to avoid unladen journeys .
the company's good reputation may be lost as a result of its involvement in human or drugs trafficking .
the czech presidency considers the finalisation of this collection of legal regulations to be highly important .
this , too , helps to ensure road safety .
i would therefore like to thank you for your willingness to adopt these laws so quickly .
the sector should not have to put up with all kinds of national outpourings a day longer .
it does not work in this case .
i would like to make a similar point about international coach transport too .
if amendments 17 and 18 are not adopted , I will be voting against the end result .
the thwarting has been fierce , which is very bad news .
i therefore believe that the position adopted is ultimately the right one .
thus , I am grateful to the two rapporteurs .
there is no prospect of an opening up in 2014 , as per parliament's request .
so , if social abuse is supposed to be a reason , it is certainly not the case here .
winston churchill said if you have 10 000 regulations you destroy all respect for the law .
it will benefit carriers , drivers and users , particularly in the current economic climate .
with regard to road transport , there are two important points I should like to make .
the first one is , indeed , access to the profession .
this is a good transitional measure that was necessary in order to define more clearly what is possible .
this has now been clarified as three times over a seven day period .
they meet the criteria .
you are very often alone in the car in strange surroundings .
this compromise version represents a fair and balanced way to combine the various interests .
our common aim is to make road transport more efficient and sustainable .
i believe that was not a point of order , but a matter of courtesy .
the other thing I want to say here concerns cabotage itself .
some say they want to see restrictions , whilst others say we have far too many restrictions .
then we shall be credible .
information should be clear and accessible , which is often a problem in the transport sector .
on behalf of my group I have tabled just three additional amendments for tomorrow's vote .
these are important legal regulations which are of great interest both to consumers and to the transport sector .
the czech presidency of course welcomes these proposals and attaches great importance to them .
large and small companies operate and journeys can take several days or just a few minutes .
at the same time it is also for the most part in line with our opinion on the proposals .
of course , good law making is not easy , but today we are taking a big step forward .
i was also pleased to hear what mr svoboda had to say .
maritime transport on the mediterranean sea takes place under different conditions from transport across straits .
there are just a few points on which I should like to expand .
in other words , we must take great care .
on behalf of the pse group . mr president , I want to congratulate both our rapporteurs .
one group is particularly dependent on clear rules .
in the case of air transport , it has become apparent that the rules are not clear enough .
i myself have received some of their accounts .
it is a disaster .
with regard to passenger rights , there have always been two alternatives to choose from .
there are many tasks for the next commission in this regard .
this is urgently needed .
so first the service and then compensation for delayed services .
that is the conclusion .
they travel to the us .
it was evident from all of the debates .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
it specifically concerns the movement of persons across the czech german border .
the sitting was suspended at 6.15 p.m. pending question time and resumed at 6.30 p.m. 
question time commission 
the next item is question time b6 0227 / 2009 .
there exists a strong potential for cross border trade in on line commerce .
everyone wants and deserves the best deal going , whether they live in lisbon or london .
surely that is not all to do with regulatory differences .
that could be an objective reason for saying that the price differential is such and such .
the mandate does not cover smes .
finally , a number of pre accession and neighbourhood countries have requested macroeconomic assistance from the european union .
from the countries of the southern region , practically all but russia and azerbaijan have requested it .
subject state aid to non eu european countries
i thank the commissioner for her helpful reply .
will the commissioner investigate this matter and use all her powers to assist ?
even then it is not guaranteed that we can be successful but it is worth a try .
furthermore , the use of the european globalisation fund can be considered under certain circumstances and conditions .
it is not correct , and I can prove it with facts and figures .
this initiative was previewed in the commission's recovery plan the previous month .
in other words this measure is of particular benefit to smes .
it is still premature for any assessment on how and if the member states will follow these recommendations .
but I would like to be even more precise .
so what does this data tell us ?
for detailed information I would refer the honourable member to the report itself .
the 2008 call notably succeeded in covering the priority given to small and medium sized enterprises .
in total , 74 % of all participations were smes .
thank you also , commissioner , for the tables which you have given me .
you have mentioned several areas where new member states are developing their activities in both programmes .
i am sure that this will be an example which will be followed later on by other regions .
subject communicating with citizens
online consultation is commonly used .
i thank the commissioner for her answer , and I agree the commission is certainly making some efforts .
this is something that we will do in cooperation with the other institutions .
of course we will try to do that as quickly as possible , not as part of the campaign .
verification of credentials see minutes
this can be condensed down very simply into four very clear areas .
such an outcome will be a very welcome development for eu performers .
this is truly innovative .
end of the intended declaration .
i believe that all the fears expressed by those who are against term extension will prove unfounded .
parliament's report calls on the commission to perform impact assessments and to monitor this measure .
therefore , a balance will still have to be found along these lines .
i consider the compromise to be satisfactory and welcome the success achieved .
i come from a point of view where I like copyright .
session musicians deserve the help they will be getting from this proposal .
i therefore congratulate all those who have been involved in coming to a sensible , just and sustainable consensus .
i would therefore like to ask colleagues who have reservations to reconsider and vote for this report .
i recognise that it is not perfect and that there are concerns .
all the other key players have reached agreement , and performers need clarification sooner , rather than later .
moreover , this money does not go directly to artists .
i believe , notwithstanding all of the hard work and goodwill , that meps should reject this proposal .
we already have an established law at the national level .
in addition , the directive includes several recommendations regarding further work to be done .
this time , however , I find it difficult to follow his intentions .
will an extension increase cultural diversity and facilitate the writing of new compositions ?
what effect has the copyright extension in the united states had on developments there ?
it is my belief that the commission should try again .
commissioner , have a rethink , rework the proposal and come back !
mr president , let me be clear I support the extension of copyright from 50 to 70 years .
the problem is the balance between the multinational record companies and the featured artists .
these artists should have been able to reclaim their property that they alone were responsible for creating .
from any type of moral perspective that is unfair .
ms lichtenberger made a fine address .
a 70 year term is open to all new innovative business models .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
copyright existed before the internet , and refers to a different era .
action plan on urban mobility debate 
mr president , commissioner , thank you .
we are going to propose to the commission the action plan that it should have proposed to us .
why ?
because , today , 60 % of europeans live in the urban community .
i should like to say that this is a report that is based on the principle of subsidiarity .
helping someone does not mean replacing them , it means contributing towards a better solution to problems !
of course , there are aspects and details that require further clarification or debate .
its aim will not be to constrain local authorities , but rather to help them .
i should like to give an example .
so , how is that linked to our debate this evening ?
the situation is in fact serious .
i thank him for his commitment and for his specific proposals .
the report contains a number of interesting proposals .
an obvious one is the collection of information , of comparable data which will help map out problems .
every year 40 000 people die on the roads of europe that is 40 000 too many .
if the inland shipping capacity is already present in european cities , this should be utilised and promoted .
legislative measures at european level are inadmissible for urban traffic .
that would take some of the strain off a city .
it is also important to take account of demographic change .
our society is constantly ageing .
transport is a fundamental problem in urban areas .
this concerns both the promotion of good experiences and the propagation of innovative , technical and organisational solutions .
combining the potential of transport , information technology and telecommunications is useful here .
they lose a lot of time because of the bad organisation of transport .
this is much more to do with subsidiarity .
i have made sure that we do not revert to this type of debate .
the question I asked myself was what can the european union's added value be ? 
the answer is , firstly , its desire to act .
we can ensure that they make urban transport more attractive to users .
that is our proposal .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 142 
european citizensquality of life depends directly on making urban transport more convenient and greener .
for this reason , making transport accessible and supporting interoperability are vital actions .
something will have to happen , however , and we will need to get things moving .
there is need for this initiative .
many of the things included in the action plan are projects which are already underway .
in addition , we are also dealing with the very important question of data security .
and , as a result , we will not secure the necessary investment .
we have all tried to avoid the heavy handed long words that too often characterise declarations of principle .
in addition , urban transport and urban mobility are very much part of urban development .
secondly , there is an ever increasing danger of all the data collected being misused .
it also safeguards the use of personal data .
we still know too little about whether potential users are willing or able to pay .
however , I do think that we need to add some intelligence to all modes of transport .
i therefore believe that the resources should be diversified in the years to come .
this will make transport in europe safer and more efficient , while promoting environmental protection and energy efficiency too .
it is in all our interests to make this a reality .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for her work .
i wish mrs jensen and the commissioner every success .
that is very important .
we have also spent some time discussing the amount of funding to be earmarked for this .
so , mr tajani , you have got off the ground with a robust negotiating mandate .
we should be aware that the current state of affairs in road transport is very worrying .
extensive use in large urban areas of telematic applications , which combine transport issues with information technology and telecommunications 
now , in the context of the climate debate , this debate has naturally taken on new importance .
marco polo ii offers improved planning security , because it is timetabled to run until 31 december 20it has a budget of eur 450 million .
the programme is based on displacing traffic and reducing the overload on road transport .
there is a problem , though .
this reduction is not enough .
i cannot understand why the other institutions should wish to pick holes in amendment we have a well stocked fund for sustainable transport .
why should we not lower the threshold more for this sector ?
for the programme to achieve its aims , marco polo ii must be made more attractive .
the legal basis needs to be changed and verification procedures need to be simpler and clearer .
rapporteur . de madam president , commissioner , I agree with you .
we must and will displace traffic wherever possible , but it is difficult .
that really would be a pity , hence this compromise .
the debate is closed .
european rail network for competitive freight debate 
the comments relating to cooperation with third countries affected by the corridor have been accepted .
the infrastructure for freight needs to be brought under european policy as it already has a significant international dimension .
the first principle is the identification of corridors and thus of the network .
this identification is based on economic rather than political factors .
my congratulations once again to the rapporteur .
thirdly , it must be clear that the overall capacity of rail transport must not be reduced .
as many of you know , john bowis was taken ill recently in brussels and was hospitalised .
his place is taken today by my friend and colleague , philip bushill matthews .
they should not have to go to court in order to achieve it .
the proposal before us now is our chance to make this a reality .
we therefore warmly welcome the forthcoming debate .
the central question in this context is what can the european union do for patients ?
i look forward to your debate .
the directive provides a measured response to these requirements .
however , I am afraid the recent vote has left a bitter taste in my mouth .
it would be a good idea if this were looked at again .
any form of gender based discrimination whatsoever practised by healthcare facilities , insurers or state officials is unacceptable .
i have one single point to make on the trakatellis report .
allow me to start by saying that my group thinks this is a very good report .
we must also point out , however , which areas of the report we particularly approved of .
perhaps a small part of the scientific community knows about it , but not every local doctor .
the first of these is that we want to see a dual legal basis .
we need this , and it is a condition of our support .
that is expressly not what we are talking about now .
we are talking about a pragmatic approach .
how can we make the system such that patients benefit from it ?
patients are in such a weak position .
that must not happen .
i very much appreciate , by the way , that the council is present here today .
a compromise is therefore necessary .
we consider that there must be exceptions for rare diseases or life threatening situations on waiting lists .
i have listened with great respect to what mrs roth behrendt said here on this matter .
what , therefore , does this directive need to improve ?
we want specific legislation .
we , ourselves , go much further .
furthermore , the proposal is superfluous . for the reimbursement of costs is already settled .
i was lucky enough to be able to afford to pay .
therefore , I am delighted that this uncertainty and confusion has been cleared up once and for all .
it is up to you to consider and choose the outcome you want to see .
here we have a piece of legislation which does forge a close relationship with european citizens .
it is only those who are desperate who travel abroad .
this is truly an improvement on the commission's proposal .
the alde's core amendment has been to appoint a european patients ombudsman .
after all , they are at the mercy of their care providers .
we have not yet reached any agreement on how to identify that section of the patient population .
i want to start by saying that we have no objection whatsoever to cross border healthcare .
this describes my sentiments too about the current crisis I see growth and recovery in everything .
introducing patient mobility will not only have an impact on healthcare .
the main advantage offered by this regulation is that it provides a win win situation .
things have largely depended on the sending country's very latest regulations .
i am sure that this regulation will improve the quality of each of our lives .
it will give me great pleasure to support this excellent document .
the aim cannot be to create a market for healthcare services .
a country that wishes to guarantee healthcare for all must be able to plan for care in this way .
the rights and safety of patients must come first .
finally , I would like to wish john bowis a speedy recovery .
in my opinion , because we have these two different philosophies we also need a double legal base .
public planning will be made more difficult and the national healthcare system is at risk of being drained .
we must take care , however , that this does not go too far .
it therefore seems necessary to specify the responsibilities of the member states in this area .
accordingly , we feel it is essential to alter the legal basis .
we do not therefore understand why the commission has not included article 152 of the ec treaty .
in conclusion , I would like to thank rapporteur mr bowis for his responsible and very competent work .
the litmus test of this directive is its legal basis .
these people now have a choice .
what manner of people are these ?
it would seem that new iron curtains are to be put up .
first , there should be no forced health tourism .
it should not be the case that insurers pressure patients to go elsewhere to receive cheap care .
secondly , there must be some minimum quality guarantees .
this involves national or international hospital accreditations .
therefore I welcome the bowis report , and wish its author a speedy return to health .
i would , however , like to draw attention to three important elements in this report .
why are you doing this ?
is there anything more cowardly ?
i will be voting for the focus to be on the patients .
sv mr president , all patients should have the right to healthcare when they need it .
i am astonished by the negative stance taken by my socialist colleagues in this respect .
eu legislation must not put these systems of solidarity in jeopardy .
health cannot be a business .
that is why we intend to reject this commission proposal .
the heated debate preceding this directive is astonishing .
but what happens ?
i am pleased that we have got this far , commissioner .
we now have the opportunity in this house to take up our responsibility .
may the council also take up its responsibility !
the proposal will at the same time improve patient rights , as mrs roth behrendt said .
i fully agree , and very much hope that this ambition will be confirmed .
this issue has to be addressed .
however , the two objectives are not incompatible .
prior authorisation for hospital treatment has to remain a safeguard mechanism , applicable when justified .
such administrative mechanisms run the risk of being both cumbersome and arbitrary .
applause 
regarding the proposed exclusion of organ transplantation , I simply cannot agree .
however , the issue of organ allocation is a different matter .
today , we can take an important step forward towards the adoption of this directive .
the vote today will light the road ahead .
i would like to thank the rapporteurs from the various committees for the remarkable job which they have done .
health is not a commodity to be bought and sold on the internal market .
this proposal is a disgrace .
it shows the commission is blindly pursuing its discredited and obsolete liberalisation agenda .
it just wants to privatise everything it can and to further centralise power in its own hands .
the european commission should hang their heads in shame and should withdraw this proposal immediately .
economically speaking , too , a better use of the capacity of specialist clinics will bring benefits with it .
public money is leaking into services abroad for the rich .
that is why I cannot support the adoption of the directive .
the czech presidency is aware that the organisation of health systems falls fully within the competency of member states .
the system will ensure immunity of course , in order to encourage reporting .
these figures are unacceptably high .
they paint a disturbing picture that affects not only patients but also their families and friends .
this could be avoided if the needles they were using were replaced with a safer kind .
it also sends a signal that this is an area of great potential for eu added value .
this reflects the fact that some member states have devolved systems of health care .
we also agree that the scale and cost of data collection should not be disproportionate to the expected benefits .
that is the added value of the european union .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
in this implementation proposal , specific mention should be made for funding and cofinancing in the following areas 
these are also reasons why the area of rare diseases is an eu health strategy priority .
the european strategy is supplemented by the proposal for a council recommendation on action within the member states .
one important sector for action is in collecting expertise via the european reference networks .
the information must also be made accessible , and the trakatellis report provides for all these matters .
thirdly , this is a controversial subject that has also been tackled by mr liese .
many rare diseases are hereditary .
that term summons up very unpleasant associations , as mr liese has already said .
thank you for your attention .
various options are available , and we are exploring them .
one option that is working well in many member states is public private partnership .
it is up to us to ensure that this is more than just a catalogue of good intentions .
for that reason we must reject this amendment .
doing so would mean that we would still be faced with the selection of embryos .
it is naturally of the greatest importance that public health policy should be given primacy over political correctness .
i do not think so .
i do not agree with that .
in addition to the patients themselves , this action will also affect their relatives and friends .
there was reference to the need for funding .
that engagement of citizens is a vital part of work in this area .

this is a private scheme .
mr president , can I reply to mr cohn bendit's point and mr hans peter martin's point ?
i think that there is a simple solution .
the simple solution is for the other 399 members to do the same .

european rail network for competitive freight 
nl I wish to raise a point of order based on article 168 2 .
theetc .should also include the recital , which is amendment 1 before the vote on amendment 100 
i would encourage other colleagues to put the patients first .
mr president , very briefly , I am trying to be helpful , but am getting hungry .
these are important votes and it is a very full agenda and I have every sympathy with you .
2007 discharge european gnss supervisory authority

action plan on urban mobility 
i would call on the member states to reconsider that decision .
the euro sceptic argument I do not expect will have much traction in this house .
et I truly have a lot of comments .
this means that it will help save 20 % of energy consumption through increased energy efficiency .
et this morning we also discussed and just voted on certain reports from the health care package .
as a result , the preparation of a separate urban transport strategy is altogether justified .
of envious neptune , is now bound in with shame ,
hath made a shameful conquest of itself . 
if there is a better description than that , I have yet to hear it .
i was unaware that you possessed such a talent for rhapsody .
however , in taking that lead , we have to show moral leadership .
the proposal complicates matters for libraries , archives , art schools and independent film makers .
european action in this area was necessary .
that is the precise opposite of medicine it is murder .
written explanations of vote
the free democratic party in the european parliament is opposed to using tax revenue to clear the deficit .
the possibility of using tax revenue to clear the deficit has not been totally excluded .
we expect these decisions to be taken before the end of april 200in writing . I abstained as I am a member of the pension fund .
that applies to their incomes , pensions and expenses .
however , I do not see this as a conflict of interest .
making buildings more energy efficient would also have a massive positive impact on carbon emissions in the eu .
it would be naïve to ignore the role of eu regulation in the current crisis afflicting the car industry .
this is because the report is insufficient and does not put enough emphasis on the right issues .
it is an important step towards equal rights for all passengers .
bus and coach passengers should enjoy rights similar to those of rail and air passengers .
talented musicians are being short changed by the current system .
i regret that there have been many false claims about this legislation .
the compromise reached is a step in the right direction , but is certainly not yet optimal .
this regulation would achieve precisely the opposite of the actual objective , which is better use of available capacities .
instead of limiting passenger transport , a solution is needed to deal with bottlenecks and shortages in railway capacity .
two areas are stifling rail freight in europe .
however , unfortunately , the majority did not agree with our position .
the member states themselves are responsible for providing medical care and for organising their health systems .
however , I would insist that the member states have sole competence to organise and fund health systems .
however , we remain concerned that the rules as drafted are not clear enough .
it is no surprise that , only recently , tory mep dan hannan advocated a privatised approach to healthcare .
however , the issue of pre authorisation is of concern to me .
prior authorisation in this directive negates patientsrights .
for this reason , the commission's proposal for a directive is a good thing .
i also value the efforts of mr bowis to reach a compromise on this fiendishly difficult subject .
i voted for the proposal on patient safety .
i did not support amendment so I could not support the overall report .
such simplification procedures are crucial for reducing the administrative burden at national , regional and local level .
to date , only four countries have done so , one of which is the netherlands .

climate and energy package and maritime transport package signature of acts 
this public signing will help to emphasise the importance of european legislation to european citizens .
thank you minister .
conclusions of the g20 summit debate 
the eu played a very significant role through its proposals and attitudes .
in this way we will strengthen these institutions financially and also restore their respect and authority .
fourthly , there is one remaining area requiring serious and careful discussion and a solution .
five minutes are set aside for the council , and it speaks for 20 minutes .
i believe this shows disrespect for the meps .
you know our rules of procedure as well as I do , mrs berès .
member of the commission . mr president , the results of the london g20 summit are substantial .
trade protectionism is a potential threat in any global recession .
the g20 took a major step towards the global regulatory convergence that europe has long been calling for .
decisive action was also agreed on non cooperative offshore tax havens .
we welcome , in particular , the reference to the end of banking secrecy .
this recession demands a coordinated response at international level .
that is the only way that we can all come out of it .
investors must know that the same standards apply throughout the world .
in this way , the global economy will be able grow by usd 150 million a year .
we now need to act quickly , in a coordinated and effective manner , exactly as olli rehn said .
next time it will be 5 % , when unemployment increases to 27 million unemployed .
let us be fair and let us create the jobs .
we can do it together .
we have to provide space for new initiatives .
europe's experience in this area is invaluable .
this is particularly crucial because solidarity is extremely important in difficult times .
since we are in the same boat , let us think in the same way !
now , the imf puts the figure at usd 4 000 billion .
that is the price of the mad dash to cash for profit and to profit for cash .
it prescribed homeopathic remedies where major surgery is obviously needed .
they are demanding not soothing words , but strong , practical action , now !
nonetheless , I should like to say very clearly that we should not exaggerate the importance of summit scenarios .
the political will to act should already exist .
then we would have one summit less .
to date we have had a lot of talk on this but no clear resolutions .
the eu and , more importantly , the political actors failed dramatically in the financial crisis .
they must draw conclusions from that and first learn what they did wrong .
therefore , the regulation proposed by the commission and amended by parliament will quickly come into effect .
however , we must also take into account the fears of our fellow citizens and respond positively to them .
what are these if not unemployment benefits , which we have defended with great clamour ?
clearly , in this respect , the g20 was incompetent .
two points the g20 conclusions assess the benefits of the doha round at usd 150 billion .
where does this figure come from ?
how can it be justified ?
we call on you , commissioner , to explain .
what we need to do now is make this a reality .
we need to continue in this direction .
that is what I wanted to say .
mr rasmussen and mrs starkevičiūttalked of pouring money into the economy .
in other words these measures must not lead to any dramatic long term threat to the stability of public finances .
the current economy is sick .
we cannot expect miracle cures to be found within the next three or four months .
none of us exist in isolation .
i will of course report this to the commission , president barroso and my colleague , joaquín almunia .
as mr daul said , we need more , not less , trade .
as replacement for louis michel next month , I am also involved in this because of my portfolio responsibilities .
indeed , the developing countries are among those which are suffering most from this economic recession .
in the current economic climate the value of concluding doha has gone up very substantially .
doha would boost the world economy and prevent protectionism from picking up .
applause 
this factor is particularly worrying as the eu is at present preparing to launch the eastern partnership .
the parties winning seats in the new parliament must agree on a realistic solution that respects democratic principles .
you perhaps know that czech prime minister mirek topolánek also visited kishinev yesterday .
he met with president voronin , with prime minister greceanu and with opposition representatives .
the main message delivered by the presidency accorded fully with the long term actions of kalman mizsei .
however , the opposition and a number of non governmental organisations declared that the elections had been marred by fraud .
the opposition is checking the electoral roles in order to produce evidence of this claim .
there is a further very serious reason for concern .
during the crisis the moldovan authorities committed serious violations of human rights .
according to the reports almost 250 people were arrested following the violent protests on 7 april .
he also called for a transparent and proper investigation of the events .
the investigation in moldova must include international participation in order to be considered reliable and fair .
moldova is facing very serious economic problems arising from the global financial crisis .
there is an urgent need for a functioning government .
external assistance will also be required , including considerable imf involvement .
it is in our interests to help moldova overcome the current crisis and to proceed further along this path .
we are following developments closely and seeking ways to promote dialogue and reconciliation between political forces in the country .
we continue to give this matter close attention .
it is crucial that allegations of serious human rights violations by the security forces are investigated thoroughly and swiftly .
today the situation in moldova is very fragile .
in other words , we care for moldova and its citizens .
the head of state changes , but the citizens remain .
the forthcoming european parliament ad hoc mission to moldova is very important .
we cannot accept that , since european integration means open dialogue .
let us therefore help moldova .
no more obstacles to lawyers or ngos , no more withholding the names and numbers of those detained .
we must show sensitivity to bilateral relations but , nonetheless , insist agreements are honoured .
president voronin and his comrades must commit to that cause .
prominent persons in moldovan society are asking for an explanation .
we must confront the moldovan authorities .
european consultation regarding the far reaching consequences of such a sweeping decision is certainly reasonable .
we should avoid these events being taken as an excuse for a unilateral solution on transnistria .
let me say , though , that the osce report was not completely uncritical .
the media must be given freedom .
maltreatment of peaceful demonstrators can never be accepted .
we have hundreds of young people who have been detained , sometimes even tortured .
we have a huge volume of specific data on this indicating election rigging .
i think that everyone should also condemn the arrests of journalists and the massive violations of freedom of expression .
you said benita is an instinctive optimist .
written statements rule 142 
i cannot fail but come to the harsh conclusion that for some europeans tibet is closer than moldova .
this happens probably when the road to chişinău passes through moscow .
i feel that the accusations being levelled at romania are also being targeted at the european union .
consolidating stability and prosperity in the western balkans situation in bosnia and herzegovina debate 
fortunately , the same cannot be said of hungary , estonia or romania .
the justification for this is that no similar demands were made of slovakia or poland , for example .
it should be obvious why this analogy is not valid .
bosnia herzegovina has been and continues to be the subject of intense negotiations at all levels of the council .
member states are supplementing the european agenda through their own efforts at a bilateral level .
bosnia herzegovina must carry out significant changes to its internal structures and decision making processes .
they are lagging far behind what is needed .
the priorities of the european partnership are also clear .
change is essential .
this constitutes a real test of maturity and it is fully supported by the eu .
the 5 + 2 list is not just another catalogue of supplementary terms and conditions .
however , initiatives at a political level require broader support .
the role of the media in particular should be more constructive .
croatia's negotiations are quite far advanced .
there have been calls for consolidation of the european union .
it is the main driving force of much needed reform and greater stability in the western balkans .
unfortunately , the negotiations are currently blocked because of the border dispute between croatia and slovenia .
over the past months we have insisted on the importance of these elections for the country's european future .
the commissioner met him back in october .
where are we today ?
the ethnic division in bosnia and herzegovina has deepened .
the lack of trust has increased .
the question of state ownership must be resolved .
constitutional reform must be tackled on the basis of a broad political and social consensus .
frustration is spreading everywhere .
good reports have again been produced here and will have broad support .
it is a long and difficult road and the objective will not be achieved overnight .
our willingness must be there .
this is the dynamic that we applied so marvellously during the last major enlargement of the eu .
however , kosovo reveals the true face of a policy aimed at the balkanisation of europe .
mr president , the ibrisagic report of course emphasises that stability in the western balkans is our major priority .
patience in all matters is a virtue , not least in foreign policy .
therefore I welcome this debate and the clear confirmation of the commitment to future expansion .
the balkansnatural vocation is to join the european union .
the first is the disunity of the european union .
i expect this will not be possible in the near or distant future .
the balkans has been and always will be a european region .
the presidency considers this step to be a very important signal to the whole region .
we consider it unhelpful for the expansion agenda to be burdened with bilateral issues .
we are prepared to continue providing assistance in this unavoidably long process .
2009 is an important year and it could be decisive for bosnia and herzegovina .
bosnia and herzegovina simply cannot be allowed to remain behind .
we want bosnia and herzegovina to achieve progress .
the vote will take place on friday 24 april 200written statements rule 142 
however , it is a region whose prospects for joining the eu are clear and unambiguous .
we are lobbying for support for the nuclear weapons convention and the hiroshima nagasaki protocol , because disarmament is possible .
the forthcoming may meeting of the non proliferation treaty preparatory committee is an important preparatory step for this conference .
we must deal with them and resolve them by strengthening the mechanism for monitoring adherence .
this is the year of all nuclear debates .
after all , the us and russia are the undisputed global nuclear hegemons .
this is what this report is all about and this is the spirit of the socialist plenary amendments .
non proliferation is absolutely fundamental .
what this actually means is disarmament instead of modernisation of british and french atomic weapons .
unfortunately , not even the npt has been able to prevent that .
that is extremely important .
this is indeed a subject of great significance .
now there is a unique opportunity .
ican was there long before obama as an international campaign for the abolition of nuclear weapons .
this also marks a unique first step in the activities of the european parliament .
education , anti discrimination and the right to work must be secured .
often their right to sexuality and maternity is restricted or there are forced abortions and sterilisations .
the president cut off the speaker 
we also urge member states and the community's executive to ensure free access and the distribution .
if the eu is to have any credibility in this debate , it must lead by example .
i can only tell you how important this is with reference to my country .
only 15 % of disabled children are integrated into the school system .
our support for ratification this week should make clear three points .
the conference was held directly under the auspices of the presidency and constituted one of the presidential events .
the european parliament must bear its responsibility for improving the conditions of people with disabilities .
the rights of disabled people are broken regularly .
recently in my home town of poznań an incident occurred which is symptomatic of this .
a member of the polish national parliament parked his car in a place reserved for the disabled .
thank you very much .
question time council 
the next item is question time b6 0227 / 09 .
subject anti lisbon rhetoric
madam president , may I thank the minister for his reply .
the eu affects eu citizens very often in an abstract way and its institutions are very difficult to understand .
the council confirmed this coordination based approach of the commission in its conclusions of 27 march 200the council declared that acceptable solutions could take various forms , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity .
therefore smes are more burdened by these complicated tax systems .
the council took the view that the use of these substances could potentially mask poor hygiene practices .
the text will be submitted for wto assessment within the framework of consultations with trading partners .
with the help of developed countries developing countries should draw up strategies and plans for building a low carbon economy .
in order to implement the copenhagen agreement it is essential to have sufficient , predictable and timely financial support .
thank you , mrs doyle .
interjection from avril doyle that is because they thought we would not reach question 10 ! 
however , it is obviously too soon to reveal our cards by publishing some of the numbers .
we have an idea of how much funding will be needed to implement the global plan .
questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers see annex .
the sitting was suspended at 20.10 and resumed at 21.00 . 
ecodesign requirements for energy related products debate 
in this sense , I believe we missed the opportunity to do more for the environment with less bureaucracy .
there is also the review in 20change is needed , but change is also possible without overburdening companies and households .
by building a low carbon and resource efficient economy we can give a new impetus to competitiveness .
i have a vision of how the european product of the future will look .
to my mind , this directive is a good example of integrated product politics .
i will pass it on to the bureau after this sitting .
the problems we face in terms of resource use go beyond energy .
the commissioner should know that .
this problem is getting worse because of growing economies and populations .
the fact is that the current growth model and concept is not sustainable .
as I said , all this could have been covered by the directive .
as I said , a missed opportunity .
our directive on ecodesign aims at innovation .
another regrettable example of the directive on ecodesign is energy labelling .
meanwhile , it is completely unclear what that means , which is hardly a good example of ecodesign .
hopefully , the evaluation will provide an opportunity for improvement .
does it place the european union and european manufacturers at the top of the market ?
another important means at our disposal is the energy labelling of equipment .
written statements rule 142 
improving energy efficiency is the quickest and cheapest way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
only in that way can we secure the necessary growth and jobs beyond the recovery phase .
finally , I will deal with ce marking and the abolition of national labelling .
it is a very important measure in a very important industry .
according to my information , producers of construction materials are very interested in the ce mark .
i wish this legislation much success .
there is also a need to address all the points that we have mentioned .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
we have done a constructive job , and I believe that we avoided resorting to dictates or mutual recrimination .
that is why we think the threshold of 90 % is more reasonable .
amendments will be tabled to this end tomorrow in plenary .
let me put things into perspective .
this affects the operation of the internal market , since honest businesses have competitive disadvantages because of tax fraud .
mr president , I will conclude .
parliament needs to be strict in this area .
the g20 conference also made the dismantling of tax havens one of the key objectives .
two systems are involved here exchange of information between tax authorities and withholding tax .
withholding tax , on the other hand , shows many virtues .
understand that one if you can !
however , any blow can now be struck in the fight against this new hydra of banking secrecy .
i hope that we will vote in favour of these reports tomorrow .
however , that is not our main problem today .
why do we find ourselves in the situation we are in now ?
it is due , above all , to the fact that we now have ownerless capitalism .
they get to buy chateaux in france or play golf in spain .
this means that the states must say at the outset that they will not take all the risks .
it is an extremely difficult thing to do , but it must be done .
i realise that it is difficult for the commissioner to reach true agreement on this under the unanimity rule .
a final comment on mrs lulling , who contrasts the two systems of information exchange and taxation at source .
i think that that is not really the point .
it is premature to speculate today on how they will react to our approach .
the eu first needs to reach a unanimous agreement internally .
madam president , I will be very brief , as I have already spoken at length just now .
fr madam president , I asked to speak in order to make a personal statement .
i wanted to make this clarification .
written statements rule 142 
the rapporteur's proposed deadline for this , which is 2014 , should receive our full support .
counterterrorism efforts focus the spotlight on asians , especially those of pakistani origin .
thirty two per cent of british muslims report being subject to discrimination at airports .
if possible , all safeguards for profiling should be drawn together in a single legal instrument .
the agency is about to present a good practices handbook for combating and preventing ethnic profiling .
it is subject to supervision by independent public authorities .
all these principles also apply to profiling as one of the ways of performing processing of personal data .
why ?
i did it myself as a kid actually .
sometimesprofilingcan be necessary , but such cases must be clearly delineated and protected against abuse .
such people get the message from our society that they are always suspect , less worthy and unwelcome .
the commission is currently launching a consultation on the challenges posed by new technologies to data protection .
the vote will take place tomorrow , friday , 24 april 2009 , at 12 noon .
i must say that the council's common position a few months after our first reading was rather disappointing .
we did move a step forward , though , and there was a very constructive atmosphere .
the parliamentary delegation , too , was a strong group .
this makes for a certain consistency , and that is important for later use as well .
we have obtained greater transparency .
those two texts would be nothing without this one , however .
this regulation is , in fact , the enforcer for the other two .
for the moment , any assessment of their volume can only be intuitive .
the vote will take place tomorrow , friday , 24 april 2009 , at 12 noon .
agenda of the next sitting see minutes
the president declared the sitting closed at 11.05 p.m. 
the barroso commission attaches great importance to the correct application of community law , making it a top priority .
thank you .
it is as serious as that .
here , on this aspect , I do not believe that we can demand too much from the commission .
the proposal before us should help solve this problem and establish a common european payment area .
this document already has some history .
this was not previously available .
i can therefore say that I am fully satisfied with the result achieved .
i welcome this .
we reduce information costs by having a common currency .
i urge you all to reflect on this .
it is not perfect .
compromises seldom are .
many of the details have been reordered .
however , this must not lead to a reduction in official control .
game gathered in the woods must not be used .
that is a good approach , because there are very many forms of comitology .
there will also be a reduction in administrative costs , and this will enable operators to be more competitive .
thank you for your work and we are pleased that we have a constructive proposal .
the main objective of the regulation before us is the guarantee of hygiene and human health and safety .
however , recently it has been stressed that the commission should step up efforts to preserve biodiversity .
the cooperation with the commission was very agreeable and for that I am very grateful .
thank you , mr rübig .
it is a very difficult time as we approach the end of the mandate .
the next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions concerning women's rights in afghanistan .
this law is fundamental to ensure that there is freedom of expression and of the media in afghanistan .
without that , anything that we are doing in afghanistan is not worth it .
i agree entirely with what ana maria gomes has just said .
what afghanistan signs up to in geneva , it cannot reject in kabul .
the authorities have a duty not to give in to extremism in any way and not to retreat .
meanwhile , journalists are now also being threatened with the death penalty by the state .
we must uncompromisingly oppose this law and the oppression of women .
we must not sit back and watch this happen and do nothing about it .
we must put a stop to this new shia family law .
all too often the mothers have simply been murdered .
we should strive to resolve this problem , in spite of cultural differences .
the law also makes it hard to justify the international community's massive military and financial assistance to afghanistan .
our policy must be conceptual but unambiguous .
de mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , afghanistan has had a difficult history .
of course , a modern infrastructure is also needed to enable the country to develop better .
it goes without saying that this review will be conducted entirely under the authority of the afghan government .
the debate is closed .
support for the special court for sierra leone
similarly , a tribunal in tanzania has been prosecuting those responsible for the rwandan genocide of 199in many ways justice delivered in this way is as valuable as financial assistance from the european union .
the un's special court for sierra leone is unable to function .
the question now is what can we still do to guarantee a better outcome ?
this is why , when judging the past , we should not forget the future .
they organised one of the most cruel rebel movements of modern times .
that tool is the court , and the court should be supported , both financially and politically .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
humanitarian situation of camp ashraf residents
the next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions concerning the humanitarian situation of camp ashraf residents .
the spirit of our amendments is quite simple .
we want to present the whole picture of human rights violations and threats in and around camp ashraf .
in short , this is about the individual human rights of the people in camp ashraf .
let us have these people and their human rights in mind when we vote .
people in ashraf are there on a volunteer basis .
this is not a political issue , colleagues it is purely humanitarian and it is very urgent .
the lives of many innocent and harmless people depend on your vote .
i would like to say a few things about it .
the mko has totally isolated all mko members living inside and outside the camp .
these are just a few examples and explanations for the joint amendments which I urge you to support .
it strives for the deportation of those people to iran in order to kill them .
this is their right , their duty , and I can assure you they are fulfilling it correctly .
it was therefore questionable if they should have remained on the eu banned terrorist list .
cs mr president , 30 seconds will be enough for me .
the amendments tabled here in this house are profoundly mistaken .
ladies and gentlemen , we will not close the debate until everyone is seated in silence .
as we all know , in january 2009 the iraqi government took back control of that area .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting

today is 24 april . I have had no answer .

i have recorded what you have said , mr beazley .
i have always been a great fan of opening sporting opportunities for people with disabilities .
i just wanted to put on record my complete support for this resolution .
madam president , I think once again this is one of those reports that many people can welcome .
that clearly shows that we ourselves are not walking the walk when it comes to energy efficiency .
i hope that this will set a precedent for other areas .
mr hamon told me that he is not interested as to whether everyone pays their taxes .
last night he told me I want to know that french people .
the president cut off the speaker 
madam president , this is on the same issue in relation to the free vote .
i wish the legislation success .
i think we all agree that war is a bad thing that is motherhood and apple pie .
therefore , we need better monitoring I think we all agree of the application of community law .
finally , I have one point to make about the iranian regime .
i constantly emphasise that people with disabilities must be treated just as people without disabilities are treated .
there are no guarantees and limitations on such fascist inclined methods , nor can there be any .
that is why the greek communist party voted against the report .
harmonisation is not necessary for prototypes and one off products .
food safety and consumer protection in the eu will thus be reinforced .
in writing . sv it is very important to create sound systems which prevent tax fraud .
nanoparticles have a high surface area and significant surface energy , which give them the following characteristics

needless to say , I completely disagree with extending the application of theblue cardsystem .
no longer are there solitary powers , independent economies or dispensable globalised countries .
that is the problem to which no solution is being given .
that is the road to be taken .
otherwise , we will experience a deep but cyclical crisis , without solving the structural problems in our economies .
we will face rising unemployment and falling demand .
what do we expect , though , when voters see that their views are not taken into consideration anyway ?
until then , this period of stagnation will persist .
secondly , the world's major proliferation in the past decades has not been pyongyang but pakistan .
nowadays , the only way to generate clean energy on a large scale is to use nuclear .
thank you , madam president .

wednesday 
i think that this house should show some measure of humility and some respect for the democratic process .
it would be really irresponsible of us not to be prepared .
on behalf of your colleague mrs kaufmann , I must disagree with you .
this part session is the last opportunity for the current parliament to express its opinion on this issue .
one minute speeches on matters of political importance
the next item is the one minute speeches on matters of political importance .
mr president , thank you for your congratulations on the anniversary of the enlargement of the european union .
it has initiated a new european policy the baltic sea strategy .
here I am repeating the message delivered by my colleague mr bushill matthews .
these fair trial provisions are defined by all of europe and are the rights of every european citizen .
i hope that in the next term parliament will also comment on this matter .
over the last year in poland a further 114 000 men have lost their jobs .
this is not only the effect of the crisis .
slovenia must stop behaving in a petty manner , so that a solution may quickly be found .
i watched in close up 
you are speaking in a free parliament .
it is time to call a halt .
thirteen per cent is not only an unlucky number , it is a downright disgrace .
they must be properly disposed of and handled according to the instructions .
monitoring the negotiations with the pirates cannot be accepted as an adequate policy .
we need greater clarity as to what commitments the european union assumes in such situations .
ro the economic crisis has had a serious impact on the global economy .
it is estimated that all member states will have negative growth rates this year .
their quality of life is also deteriorating .
she went on to make that now famous speech in bruges that sparked opposition to the project .
if you would allow me this comment , I think she was , and is , a great lady .
so margaret thatcher agreed to majority voting in the council this was a great decision .
in germany restrictions have been imposed on the managers of companies subsidised by the state .
mr president , it would be good if the european commission could also set an example in this regard .
your words do not contradict what I said .
i am satisfied that between 1996 and 1999 you were absent from the european parliament .
we are all familiar with the stories about mistreatment of women by the taliban .
i urge you to write to the commissioner to take some action .
i have always tried to allow as many people to speak as possible .
eight human to human transmissions have been reported , in one instance even to a health care worker .
it is clear that we all benefit from our integrated european economy and society .
but we should not focus unduly on the negative aspects of these events .
europe means solidarity in standing together to face this threat .
the second issue that I want to mention is that of antiviral drugs .
an obligation was introduced for the member states to have an adequate quota .
subsequently , nothing much was decided .
what measures have been taken , and are these actually coordinated ?
i have my doubts .
i am not blaming the commission , then .
where was the council , though ?
it is hard to do anything with this council .
yet I agree with mr trakatellis and mr maaten .
it is time for solidarity .
therefore , the europe of solidarity must take action , as must the europe of communication .
the concern is for next winter .
in germany , I feel that I have been provided with sufficient information on how I should behave .
it is the member states that are responsible for providing this information .
we should also take this opportunity to remind them that they need to fulfil their duty to provide information .
congratulations !
that concludes thecatch the eyeperiod .
member of the commission . mr president , I thank members for their contributions .
many speakers mentioned antivirals and the sufficiency of stocks .
equal treatment between men and women engaged in a self employed capacity pregnant workers debate 
their fate has been a matter of concern for the european parliament since the 1990s .
why table amendments that are vague and legally unsound ?
i call on the alde group to withdraw these amendments .
i assume that there is a misunderstanding between the shadow rapporteur of that group and mr cocilovo .
however , the most innovative proposal in relation to the european commission's proposal concerns paternity leave .
family life is one of the reasons why there are more unemployed women than men .
i am delighted with the progress made on both of the legislative proposals tabled by the commission .
this significant principle has been established by the european court of justice .
furthermore , this amendment would greatly complicate the possibility of reaching agreement with the council .
the increase from six to twelve months is therefore simply good sense .
this issue is not just about women it is also about society .
i do not think that paternity leave has a place in this directive .
however , if it must remain part of it , it must be more flexible .
we support the motion , although we do not think it goes far enough .
at a time of drastic demographic collapse in europe , every form of support for the family is valuable .
in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity individual member states should always be looking for better solutions .
i would also like to draw attention to two problems .
against this background , the occupational safety regulations relating to mothers deserve particular attention .
it would not be appropriate if parliament waded into the discussion like a bull in a china shop .
i am unable to support the proposed amendment 22 , especially the second part of it .
like the international labour organization ilo , the commission has now proposed 18 weeks .
my second point concerns parental , paternity and adoption leave .
i think that mrs lulling has done an excellent job on this .
in certain countries , maternity leave is paid out of tax revenue .
in this respect , companies are called on to help to ensure a family friendly working environment .
it is not enough to say that we defend these rights .
sk motherhood is the greatest miracle which god has bestowed on women .
so there are tools other than the directive , in my view .
allow me to add a few words on maternity protection , because our position has been very badly misunderstood .
it is a conservative and unacceptable position , which is out of touch with reality .
commissioner , I have not talked about parental leave , but about paternity leave .
is the commission actually trying to remain out of touch with the reality that already exists in member states ?
i am very surprised at this position , commissioner .
written statements rule 142 
in writing . even during a crisis , equal treatment should be high on the political agenda .
in this way , women would have an efficient tool for contributing to the development of the economy .
i very much regret that the two institutions did not succeed in finding any common ground .
the council in particular did not move an inch on the question of the opt out .
the council was not prepared to accept this restriction .
it is an indisputable fact that the opt out is used today by 15 of the 27 eu member states .
the council wanted to prevent this but parliament has ruled otherwise .
too many member states simply insisted on using individual exceptions and on retaining this provision in the directive .
this is a lost opportunity .
this is not true they are fooling themselves .
the council did not want to put an end to the opt out .
it took away doctorsrights and it took away their working conditions .
what is more , they have accused us of doing this during an election period .
applause 
why should someone not be allowed to earn overtime if that is what they choose to do ?
he has stabbed the social democrats in the back .
they do things their own way , including the way they work .
i agree , and I for one insist on being more representative of the citizens .
it is regrettable that agreement will not be reached .
no doubt there may be a few more , and that is not a good situation .
i can also tell you that we made some progress during the negotiations .
i can confirm that there is actually a majority in favour of removing the opt out .
the opt out that you want still exists in practice , as opposition to progress has carried it through .
fortunately , the large majority in the european parliament said no .
therefore limiting working times is all the more necessary , bearing in mind the need for workersfreedoms .
the responsibility for the failure therefore lies fairly and squarely with the council .
parliament has done its duty .
madam president , it is really bizarre that the council should blame parliament for the breakdown in these talks .
in practice this is , therefore , stealing the employee's time .
to require workers to systematically work overtime and put in long working weeks is to destroy jobs .
we are only trying to adapt it to the current economy and the global economic situation .
we are not living in the 20th century .
can you see this mobile phone , can you see these computers ?
the council agreed to this but it was still not passed .
ladies and gentlemen , the debate featured arguments that have been used many times before and for good reason .
a directive was approved in 1993 which accepted the exception .
since that point , the number of member states using the opt out has risen sharply .
the reason for that is quite simple .
i must state quite clearly that the information which we were given in the trialogue was quite different .
i would like to make it clear that we did receive this information .
the results were quite clear 15 votes in favour , none against and five abstentions .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 142 
agenda see minutes
i am grateful that commissioner tajani can support them .
the paper intimates that self employed drivers work 86 hour weeks .
over half own the vehicle they drive .
they therefore do everything themselves they maintain their vehicles and do their own accounts .
in any case , how would compliance with such a regulation be monitored ?
it is vitally important to aid employment and entrepreneurship during an economic crisis .
poor transposition of and compliance with the legislation cannot be a reason to relax the rules .
the current directive removes a fundamental principle of the free market , namely , entrepreneurship and support for it .
including them in the new directive will actually destroy their entrepreneurial drive .
adopting such a decision would have an adverse impact on the european economy .
the definition of night work is also of great practical significance .
forty thousand people die every year on the roads of the european union .
large numbers of people are injured or permanently disabled .
all of this is simply accepted , as if it were an act of god .
everyone knows that a disproportionate number of lorries is involved in serious road accidents .
madam president , we need to reject this proposal from the commission for three clear reasons .
driving time represents only half on average of the working time of a driver .
we need to reject this proposal from the commission .
now we face the practical issue of whether we should support them or not .
we shall not achieve this by raising obstacles to work .
the vote will take place on tuesday 5 may 200parliament's estimates of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 2010 debate 
in some areas savings have already been identified and improvements proposed .
i firmly believe that if we improve medium term budget planning and increase its transparency we will achieve efficiencies .
expenditure on purchasing and renting buildings is one of the main administrative cost items of eu institutions .
just over three years ago the institutions were using total space in excess of 2 million square metres .
we can achieve annual savings of millions of euros by improving cooperation between european institutions .
we are keeping our budget below the 20 % limit on appropriations for administrative costs .
the vote will take place on tuesday 5 may 200trade in seal products debate 
but , of course , there are exceptions .
if people in any of our member states wish to hunt , they can still continue to hunt .
what they cannot do is take commercial gain from the results of that hunt .
after our exchange of views , we were all in tears .
the citizens can now be sure that seal products will no longer be available on the market .
i can imagine that the relevant negotiations with the member states were not always plain sailing .
both these advisers informed us that the legal basis used was wrong .
that is what I remember .
i hope that my fellow members realise exactly what they are doing .
we are simply relocating the problem .
you have solved nothing .
i can see no self satisfaction in that .
it is much appreciated . 
better information is required , as consumers should be able to make a more informed choice .
we are , of course , also following parliament's written statement which clearly demanded the ban .
this makes it very clear that there is a legal foundation for what we are doing .
there are foundations for our actions .
only if a clear distinction is made will the inuits have the opportunity to sell anything .
seal hunting occurs in sweden , but it is controlled protective hunting .
the compromise that has now been proposed is better than the original motion .
let us hope that I am wrong .
this is not only gruesome but also totally senseless .
i say to all meps please stop this disaster and vote against this proposal .
sv madam president , I am very pleased indeed that we have finally reached this point .
the rules are not complied with out on the ice .
i would like to thank all my fellow members who have made this possible .
who has anything against that ?
consequently , what is being done here is a disaster for greenland .
treating poor people like this is beneath us .
however , I need an assurance from the commissioner .
perhaps I could ask a direct question through the chair to the commissioner .
the issue is whether they are killed humanely or not .
i am very pleased that it is possible tonight to reach a first reading agreement on this highly sensitive file .
regarding the issue that mrs doyle referred to , this will be dealt with in the implementing measures .
as with all compromises , somebody or everybody will perhaps be a little disappointed by something or other .
we cannot deal with the hunting from here , not the hunting that occurs in third countries .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on tuesday 5 may 200written statements rule 142 
marketing of some pharmaceutical products made from seals , such as dietary supplements , will not be allowed .
thank you very much .
protection of animals used for scientific purposes debate 
by working together we have been able to come up with what I believe is a good compromise .
animal testing is a highly controversial area and involves a moral dilemma .
is it ever right to test on animals in order to potentially save the lives of humans ?
the omission of definitions of a severity classification was a glaring hole in the whole proposal .
it is also a step forward for medical research .
we also want to see animal tests reduced .
however , european citizens quite rightly demand that the best and more effective medicines are available .
however , the liberal group appears to be trying to drive a coach and horses through this agreement .
i am certain that the dialogue which ensues will be constructive .
moreover , numerous scientific agencies made a significant contribution to this procedure .
however , there is no evidence that there will be any such drain to non eu countries .
we know that this is the case from the public reaction .
you have extended the directive to cover all animal species , not just mammals .
the commission has also effectively resolved the highly controversial issue of tests on non human primates .
unfortunately , many details of the commission proposal have been amended by the votes in the committees .
however , it is a pity that article 15 has not got through .
we must provide a set of values , because that is our job .
this is about protecting laboratory animals and not about business profits .
these procedures are unethical and barbaric .
finally , the use of non human primates in experiments must be phased out completely and rapidly .
the commission can accept numerous amendments in full , in part or in principle .
they also include proposals for regular review of the use of non human primates at european union level .
we are right to keep the momentum going .
this is regrettable because we need to come forward with a sensible proposal in the end .
we do not deliver this report lightly .
we have put serious work into it and we have good compromises .
this demonstrates the commission's commitment towards the end goal of the abolition of animal experimentation .
there remains a huge gap in the development of alternative , non animal testing methods .
public opinion polls tend to support this approach and they cannot be ignored .
ship source pollution and penalties for infringements debate 
in conclusion , I wish to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work he has done on this report .
unfortunately , the subject is always largely ignored in the interim .
i too would like to congratulate mr de grandes pascual .
this is why , above all , attention must be focused on monitoring .
consumer rights debate 
are we asking consumers to give up some of the rights they have under national law ?
our questions therefore focus on the details of specific areas where we would like to see further work .
i was delighted you mentioned the house of lords because I was also going to reflect on that .
the council and parliament should now incorporate these three central points into a fully harmonised proposal .
consumers often pay for the services of these consumer groups before deciding on a purchase .
this helps these organisations to remain independent .
following the expansion of the eu it is all the more difficult and complex to be a consumer .
the european consumer centre and the europa diary can also help consumers considerably .
recommendation to the european commission in complaint 185 / 2005 / elb short presentation 
nothing less and nothing more than that .
our opinion was that our position would be recognised by the ombudsman .
consequently the commission returned to its previous practice .
this approach also supports an active policy of training of young conference interpreters .
but the commissioner has failed to make a single mention of the ombudsman's recommendation .
thank you to all the staff and thank you to all the interpreters , whatever age they may be .
the vote will take place tomorrow tuesday , 5 may 2009 .
closure of the sitting
the most important thing is that it makes the package robust for the next decade .
there will be plenty of briefing about that afterwards .
i just want to give you a sense of what we have achieved and what we are looking for .
in this directive we have significantly improved the rights of consumers and users in the electronic space .
above all , they are entitled to have their data in the electronic communications space protected .
all of those are included in this proposal .
i look forward to your support for this tomorrow because it is so important for all our futures .
so , thank you very much .
the vote of the european parliament is very good news for consumers all over europe .
it is very important for our industry .
i welcome parliament's strengthening of the rules concerning the use of cookies and similar devices .
this is the first time an obligation of this kind has been introduced at european level .
i have to make two declarations in response to points raised by parliamentarians .
many thanks , commissioner , for this excellent collaboration with the commission as well .
that is a good sign .
i would like to single out what in my view is the most important point .
by we , I mean young people , who communicate worldwide .
it creates the necessary legal framework , so that businesses can invest in the expansion of broadband networks nationwide .
the risks in building the new networks have been distributed satisfactorily and fairly .
what else will the telecom package regulate ?
let me make two points .
there have been some important achievements as a result of the negotiations with the council .
things will perhaps be better in one member state than in another .
as parliament we should do better than this .
it is about interaction , freedom of expression , creativity and creative zest .
in so doing , I will vote for democracy and an economy with opportunities for everyone .
it includes no specific proposals to improve the legal supply of cultural goods .
finally , it scorns the presumption of innocence and the right to defend oneself .
to conclude I would once more like to refer to my fellow member mrs trautmann's report .
we need judicial control before net access is blocked .
at this very moment , mr sarkozy is challenging the european institutions over the future of the internet .
what is our response going to be ?
are we going to remain silent and not answer ?
information given to consumers in contracts alone is not sufficient .
national powers should have a role in investigating any restriction that service providers impose .
the president cut off the speaker 
the telecommunications industry is one of europe's leading dynamic industries .
such groups include the elderly and the disabled .
it needs to be protected and diversified .
we already decided earlier on that information is a civil right .
our knowledge is simply insufficient for that .
however , meps were anxious to ensure that democratic accountability over use of the spectrum was maintained .
i am afraid that private deals by leaders behind closed doors are not the way to make eu legislation .
i regret that this occurred .
madam president , I have a few observations .
that should be enough .
that is quite an important contribution .
when changing provider , consumers must be able to keep their own number within a day .
they must be ensured unimpeded access to means of telecommunication .
however , on this last point , I have to say that the democratic movement's delegation was disappointed .
that tells us how much importance they attach to fundamental rights .
the right to a judicial process must not be called into question on any pretext .
i have received hundreds of letters on this matter , and not only from poland .
this will also make an important contribution to an innovative society , and we are grateful for that .
in my view , this is an essential principle which must be observed .
nevertheless , I have a problem with this package .
i have to say I find this extremely irritating .
in my eyes , it would be a crying shame if this amendment were not adopted .
we do want a compromise with the council , of course , but not at all costs .
the president cut off the speaker 
my congratulations to the rapporteurs and to the commission .
this package includes numerous documents .
improved competition must be central .
that is why I share mrs trautmann's point of view .
who could have imagined a few years ago that we would now have services like bbc iplayer or youtube ?
at the same time , this does not eliminate all threats to the internet .
there are many other issues that will continue to be discussed , and I look forward to those debates .
however , I would like to say clearly that citizens cannot have an unlimited right to unrestricted illegal downloading !
this is not a point that can be negotiated here .
it is not the french model .
allow me to answer some of the questions which have been raised .
it is already possible for several companies to share the investment risk under the current rules .
the second question concerns data breaches .
it has been a very constructive debate .
they are important for every consumer .
our task as regulators is to allow that dynamism , that innovation , to continue .
it is that sense of dynamism and urgency that we need to move forward .
let us move on from here and look towards the future .
therefore , I call on the european commission to take the greatest care when transposing this telecoms package .
i believe that thousands of europeans want to know why .
it will be significantly easier for consumers to obtain information from their service provider and change service providers .
precontract information must indicate whether a consumer is tied to a contract for a specific period of time .
i shall comment on just two issues which have caused serious confrontation .
it is undoubtedly very successful and recognisable and has made a huge contribution towards energy savings .
it certainly also has numerous problems .
however , 1992 is some time ago .
there are , however , two points that I must strongly oppose .
it must be stressed that advertising is key for free , independent , diverse and high quality media .
our solution is to give producers and retailers the possibility of providing information on specific energy consumption saving aspects .
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur .
i will continue to support us having an interesting debate , even during second reading .
this decision is wise and right .
therefore , in my opinion the commission's proposal is the smarter , more sensible one .
i have followed labelling legislation for the last 15 years .
it obstructed the updating at the end of the 1990s .
a to g is easy to understand .
we need decisions based on facts .
member of the commission . madam president , it is difficult .
industry is also looking for more energy efficient appliances to produce and place on the market .
the second was about the eco design measure for fridges and tv sets .
the report does not at this stage give a complete solution .
thank you for the debate .

animal testing is a highly controversial and emotional area which does involve a moral dilemma .
we had a good compromise in the agriculture committee and it should not be picked apart at this stage .
all are examples of the benefits of animal research .

mr president , I am grateful to you for calling me .
the truth is , however , that the people are not really represented in this chamber .
mr president , I welcome the adoption of this report .
they are not an endangered species even the wwf says so .
then again , democracy is not strictly rational .
people are not always calculating machines .
i do not know .
that company has shown that it is possible to develop alternatives that work .
it is possible to go further .
we have only made a small step .
we need to do much more .
i have received a number of letters on this issue and constituents across my region express their dismay .
i abstained on the amended proposal , because I feel that on this issue no compromises are necessary .
thank you .
lv thank you , mr president .
i voted in favour .
since everything is voted on in a single vote , we were not able to oppose these proposals .
for the above reasons , we have voted against the report in question .
improving the quality of our ambient air remains a major challenge to be addressed .
in writing . lt transparency is a fundamental principle of the european union .
it now falls to the soon to be elected parliament to give its verdict during the new parliamentary term .
should we exclude all self employed drivers from this directive ?
it is a victory for road safety and social europe .
there is no such regulation in any other sector .
this decision will have an irreversible adverse impact on the european economy's competitiveness .
small carriers and sole traders will be hardest hit .
in this case , we have chosen to make a judgment based on the overall situation .
the text of the regulation allows for several exceptions which in some cases are necessary .
it is also a source of satisfaction to the 425 meps who signed the written declaration on this subject .
in writing . I am pleased today that we voted to ban the eu trade in seal products .
the proposal to permit the import of seal products subject to a labelling requirement did not receive our support .
in my opinion , a total ban is the right approach .
regulation has not , therefore , curbed the success of this industry .
sadly the european parliament missed the opportunity to take a strong line on animal protection today .
in writing . sv this report recommends the amendment of an existing directive on ship source pollution .
in writing . it I voted in favour .
any advert must indicate energy consumption and energy savings .
member states can adopt incentive measures , including tax credits for products which are extremely energy efficient .

i am working hard !
it is obvious that any attempt to put pressure on them might prove counterproductive .
we have already begun doing so , both at eu level and more globally .
we have recently reaffirmed the existing employment guidelines and adopted country specific recommendations .
there was a summit yesterday between the eu and japan in prague .
this essential ballot will be held against a background of real difficulties for many of our citizens .
our response to the crisis must be founded on our fundamental values of responsibility , solidarity and social justice .
all europeans of heart and conviction must be prepared to get involved .
parliament has shown its determination to achieve concrete results for citizens .
we have to speak clearly and with conviction to the electorate about this europe of results .
europe needs it .
inevitably , the main focus of the european council will again be the economic crisis .
here , again , I would like europe to be the first to move at global level .
we will discuss the employment summit in more detail later .
our response to the crisis cannot be limited to technical measures to address regulatory problems .
the treaty of lisbon stipulates this move , which would be a positive development .
the credibility of the european union is at stake .
the european people's party christian democrats and european democrats seem to be behind it .
again , I would like to come back to your consultation , which you can have today .
if you compare both papers , there is a huge difference .
mr nyrup rasmussen will express this clearly and articulately .
mass youth unemployment !
the time has come to make clear how we will proceed .
president in office , your presidency has not been bad .
for all that lisbon matters , it will not define this european election campaign .
not waiting to react or to respond to events elsewhere but leading the charge as to what will happen .
one thing is very clear the european council did not want to put its money on the table .
however , it was not to become a major joint summit on the rising unemployment in europe .
it could almost have been done on purpose !
it represents a significant challenge to the present single currency system .
as mentioned previously , the situation is particularly acute in ireland , greece and a number of other states .
last but not least , it is rejected by the president of your own country , václav klaus .
i therefore cannot understand why you are now lowering yourself to the same practices .
however , it should also look at how the eu can assist enterprise in the longer term .
that is why europe cannot be allowed to go down a socialist route this june .
the economic downturn has caused the socialists to show their true colours .
they believe politicians should dictate how many hours you can work .
nothing epitomises thepolitician knows bestattitude better than the recent debate over the working time directive .
in britain , 3 million people use the opt out .
nothing !
but can I remind you that an unemployment level of 11.1 % next year is 27 million unemployed people ?
can I put the following proposal to you ?
at the same time , imperialist aggression and the militarisation of the european union are being stepped up .
what have the monopolies gained ?
i was pleased to hear both deputy prime minister vondra and president barroso speak about targets .
i would also add that some people are now challenging the sustainability of the european social model .
the union's czech presidency would have better served europe's ambitions by organising a full employment summit .
one of the most crucial aspects of the eastern partnership is going to be visa freedom .
a successful eastern partnership , however , needs determination on our side and a positive openness .
it is vital to motivate our partners to make a full commitment to european values and rules .
sv thank you , madam president , commission president barroso , mr vondra .
you must be joking .
what kind of text would this have been if we had not brought it to your attention ?
you have missed the point mr barroso .
we therefore need an environmentally compatible streamlining of transport policy .
only in this way can we avoid unilateral rules which distort competition to the cost of the european economy .
if we want to be successful in copenhagen , we must also discuss an environmentally compatible transport policy .
this is a crucial issue for democracy and I think that the president of parliament should defend it .
finally , mr vondra , I would like to congratulate you on your presidency .
this includes my country , poland .
we do not want a return to nationalism .
we particularly need the political will to respond to the current economic situation .
it is a matter for the irish people to decide whether we ratify the lisbon treaty or not .
i hope we do , and I will work very hard to achieve that .
i would urge him to revise his line .
we cannot have a european union that ignores that .
we are now certain that it is not sufficient .
the presidency will meet with you here at the end of june .
i have no doubt that it will contribute to a successful conclusion of the czech presidency .
in the context of the current economic crisis , this is the most important challenge for all of us .
jean claude juncker talked about this on monday yesterday before the ecofin meeting started in the eurogroup .
applause 
that is a strategic mission to promote stability , well being and prosperity in our eastern neighbourhood .
going back to the june council , many of you were talking about the future commission .
i said clearly that we , as the presidency , will consult the european parliament immediately after the elections .
now I would leave you with my personal testament .
applause 
however , I have not heard much about any of this yet today .
it is affecting the emerging markets .
however , I cannot respond to this challenge at present .
that is not the european parliament's fault , nor is it the commission's fault .
that is a mistake .
now there is something that would be worth achieving during the next parliamentary term .
however , there is no point asking the european institutions for what they cannot provide at this stage .
i myself am a party man .
i think that is important for the future .
let us be clear about the truth the czech republic is facing a political problem .
however , it is also thanks to the czech presidency .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 142 
eu was established as an attempt not only to assure peace but also as a tool for cooperation .
we must maintain european solidarity while adhering to rules and principles that stem from the eu treaty .
eu must make maximum use of the single market and stand up for open trade in the economic downturn .
we must also look at strengthening and restructuring the labour market so as to prepare it for the future .
these workshops have enabled us to focus , with the social partners , on the key areas of concern .
the newly unemployed should not be allowed to become long term unemployed .
this week's summit will certainly need to take into account this important goal .
we cannot and will not seek to push job creation for a few .
however , we now urgently need to evaluate its impact on employment .
the march european council decided on a more restrained format , to my great regret .
it should draw its essence from our most fundamental values social justice and solidarity .
secondly , europe really can change things and make a contribution .
we can also act as a reception centre for ideas , as a laboratory .
the input of this parliament into that process has been most valuable .
i would like to point to four key issues that have emerged from these events .
finally , upgrading skills and matching labour market needs .
i want this summit to yield concrete , tangible results .
europe is not only an economic and political project .
the egf is the baby here .
they risk being forgotten and that is something we have to be very much aware of .
the report also says that it is important that member states should be considering a minimum wage .
social security systems do not always respond to that very well .
will we finally approve a minimum wage tomorrow ?
the european citizens have been demanding a strong social europe for years .
we in the committee on culture and education have contributed via this opinion .
there is also a need to promote university business cooperation .
lifelong learning is also very important .
the second is to put a clear european project on the table for the g20 summit in the spring .
we are taking a step forwards , but we still have a lot to do .
several of the leaders will not attend this meeting .
the commission wanted a summit .
is this an unavoidable development ?
i have just one question .
has this report really been prepared for the people and will the aid get through to them ?
it is hardly used or not used at all for the other intended measures .
you will say that this is a matter for the member statesgovernments , but I say no !
that document mentioned how the transition to low carbon economies would have an important impact on employment .
how social is it if the family is deprived of some of the nice things in life ?
how social is it to overturn the way national parliaments have tried to protect workers ?
he wants to know if he can utilise the knowledge that he acquired while he was in work .
poverty promotes social exclusion and restricts access to education and health care .
we have often criticised the fact that the economic pillar is overvalued compared to the other two .
the social agenda has significantly strengthened the social pillar .
we can only hope that the council and the commission will also take these demands seriously .
it madam president , ladies and gentlemen , I will focus on the globalisation adjustment fund .
madam president , there are structural weaknesses that are a heavy burden and prevent us from moving forward .
we must rid ourselves of that burden and implement the social agenda .
ro the european union has been admired for a long time for its social model .
we need a european solidarity and cohesion policy , backed up with specific legislative , fiscal and financial measures .
i am delighted we are having this key debate .
we will really miss you and be thinking of you .
this half day troika is a pathetic response .
i should also like to thank mr silva peneda for including this in his report .
this decision has to be left up to the worker .
i think the debate was very important and constructive , just with regard to the merits of the issues .
however , a number of things have changed in comparison with the earlier crisis .
however , I wish to say that the prague summit is an exceptional event .
it is being prepared in an exceptional way .
it also provides a good basis for actions to be taken after the crisis .
some specific questions were raised in the debate , which I would like to answer .
mrs juknevičienwas concerned that money from the fund often fails to reach those who need it .
i think it should be stressed that our line is absolutely clear .
the egf is also part of the european social model .
he was right to say ,a stitch in time saves nine.
that is quite clear , and that is not its purpose .
member states still have some responsibility .
the comment by mr naranjo escobar was very accurate and concerns a task for the future .
at this stage of the debate , I want to make three comments .
my third comment concerns the problem of trust .
thank you very much .
the debate is closed .
what the government leaders and politicians need is to address the situation with imagination and concrete measures .
the best way is to stimulate the creation of new jobs .
moreover , europe has to invest in education , especially in life long learning .
the next commission should assess the transposition of the posting directive in member states .
it shows that we are a long way from the objective of making the union a europe for citizens .
question time commission 
particular emphasis is placed on ensuring support for developing countries which have committed to the good governance principles .
es thank you very much for your answer , commissioner .
they affect wealth creation and do not stimulate investment .
member of the commission . well , there is a treaty and the treaty is very clear .
the commission awaits the response of the european parliament to the approach proposed in its communication with particular interest .
what is the difference ?
in fact , I am very surprised that this debate is being held after the recent disaster in italy .
on our initiative several warning devices have been installed there .
mr pirker added yet another and , of course , we shall find others .
in particular , there are specific provisions for nuclear installations and there is the seveso ii directive for industry .
so we addressed as a matter of urgency the electricity grids and interconnection between member countries .
that is why it was not included , not because I do not believe in it .
i have noted carefully what you have said .
subject nuclear power stations
so whatever project is being proposed , we are not discriminating between member states .
so , we cannot go with a regional approach .
what is the commission doing to support cities like cork in their efforts to promote sustainable energy ?
in 2008 we supported the initiative from cities to have a covenant of mayors .
this can be as much as 4 % of the total regional fund allocation .
thank you to commissioner piebalgs for his response .
without this bottom up approach , we will fail to use the opportunities that exist .
subject the economic crisis and avoiding protectionism
can any progress be reported with regards to completing the doha round ?
the g20 leaders expressed their renewed commitment to reaching a swift conclusion of the doha round .
this is an important component that we should factor in .
the free trade agreement with korea would create new market access in many areas of interest to eu exporters .
the free trade agreement would also present a useful point of reference for other negotiations .
it is estimated that 650 000 korean cars would sell in europe per annum .
this plant is currently mothballed and the workers are on standby .
member of the commission . I understand your concerns about the situation in the car industry .
a swedish court before which a case was brought by the ombudsman has just given a similar ruling .
the commission has planned another meeting for the 14th of this month .
thank you , therefore , for your answer and we look forward to seeing what happens next .
i know that you are of italian origin , so once again , thank you .
i was recently in amsterdam and watched klm dealing with delayed passengers by rebooking them on a self check in .
the staff systematically , without asking the passengers , declined the compensation and assistance which they were entitled to .
can we have some monitoring by the commission ?
can we have some people actually at airports looking at what the airlines do ?
because , frankly , it seems to me that it has become a joke .
i hope that the commission's work will improve the situation and provide citizens with the answers they expect .
how does the commission assess the prospects for future privatisations of airlines in the eu ?
i would like to draw your attention to this in particular , as progress here is still very slow .
on 31 march , the european commission published two invitations to submit ten t proposals .
questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing see annex .
a mixture of red and white wine in the guise of rosé ?
the european union market is starting to be targeted by these third country blends .
we have often heard in this chamber that we must guarantee the european wine market a certain future .
however , I am from bordeaux .
here we have a rosé wine .
other members have said as much , that food counterfeiting will reign ever more .
we therefore say to you look at what is already happening in some countries.
today , one fifth of rosé production involves blending .
i would maintain that the commission does not have to systematically bleed the other four fifths .
i completely agree with mrs laperrouze .
madam president , commissioner , I am delighted to see you here again today .
i urge you to do this for the sake of the quality of european wine production .
now we are considering the idea of colouring white wine with red wine to make rosé wine .
if it is an industrial product , then it can be blended , like a wine coca cola .
fr madam president , commissioner , when I arrived here I was extremely annoyed .
i remember that speech very clearly .
watch out on 19 june .
secondly and importantly , the reputation of european wine will be damaged yet again .
we also adopted the addition of sugar to wine .
nor shall we have the courage to do so now .
europe can only assert itself with the very high quality wines which it has .
i therefore implore that we get off the slippery slope of these decisions .
i sometimes wonder , who is guiding whom here ?
traditionally our wine making has evolved in europe .
would that be possible in future for these low grade wines ?
they are linked to our traditional producers and we set great store by this for the future .
therefore , we ask for your support .
moreover , no one has ever asked you to authorise this oenological practice .
this is what we are asking you .
how do you expect our fellow citizens to understand such a stance on the part of the european commission ?
organise a european competition to name this something else if you think it should be legalised .
therefore , there is too much ambiguity .
so we are on exactly the same wavelength here .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 142 
the next item is the commission statement on democratic process in turkey .
political pluralism is an integral part of any democracy .
the commission also continues to follow closely the closure case against the dtp currently pending in the constitutional court .
that is an essential part of the process of democratisation of turkey .
careful reporting has an important role to play here .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this is the last plenary sitting of this legislative period .
my fellow member mr öger has just said that turkey is a priority .
it is the first copenhagen criterion that is in question .
there are varying opinions as to how turkey has developed .
turkey is an important neighbour , an important , respected nato partner .
we would be grateful if this could be documented persuasively in the next legislative period .
it is a bad thing that the prime minister has called on the population to stop buying certain newspapers .
the scope for finding a political solution to the kurdish issue has been drastically curtailed .
another 14 year old , who was fleeing a police gas attack , drowned after falling into a river .
hundreds of democratically elected politicians and activists of the dtp have been imprisoned , including three party leaders .
the list goes on .
the european institutions and the turkish authorities should learn from this wisdom at long last .
we have seen the murders of priests or missionaries in the past two years , we have infinite problems .
cyprus is still under turkish military occupation , in defiance of international law .
de mr president , I would like to respond to what mr lagendijk has said .
once again I would like to ask the commission a specific question .
if no , why is it no longer concerned ?
as I said , this is after all about the first copenhagen criterion , the political criterion .
there has been critical but constructive support for our engagement with turkey in a very critical period .
the debate is closed .
we kill billions of animals for meat , for skins and for a variety of economic needs .
by protecting animals from inhuman treatment we protect our own humanity .
there were several areas of controversy .
the committee members were of the opinion that such a ban would be unworkable .
the spirit of saint francis of assisi is present in this chamber .
the commission suggests that subsidiarity should be maintained in this area .
therefore the commission believes that prior stunning should always be performed when pigs or lambs are slaughtered outside slaughterhouses .
where this has been properly implemented , it has provided good results .
animals are also killed in huge numbers outside slaughterhouses in order to control the spread of disease .
transparency , which means proper reporting , is therefore essential .
we have found a balance between religious tradition and animal welfare that most people are happy with .
i do not believe this is fair .
that is why we propose that the relevant authority be responsible for ensuring the rules are correctly applied .
what should we do to change this ?
on religious slaughter , I think the commissioner is absolutely right .
my congratulations .
the european regulations introduced in the area of animal protection are among the most stringent in the world .
i believe that animal welfare standards in europe are absolutely paramount to the fact that we produce high quality meat .
i think the commission must make up its mind .
freedom of religion is one thing , causing unnecessary pain to animals and violating hygiene rules is another .
the commission proposal introduces important innovations which I hope you can support .
in addition , meat import certificates must confirm that eu standards have been respected in the exporting establishments .
i thank parliament and its rapporteur for their support .
the first of these is money .
community means are essential here in order to achieve the objectives that have been set .
i am glad that there is approval for these proposals in this chamber .
the debate is closed .
so there are some innovative features that should make our debates a little more lively .
so there are a lot of interesting things in here .
that is a rather sensible improvement to our procedures .
in our parliament , the committees have very strong roles .
to his credit I must say that this is the second modification of the rules of procedure .
i would also like to commend amendment 68 concerning the recasting procedure .
you cannot change the requirements in order to keep certain groups , persons or attitudes from having influence .
fortunately , the legal service rejected this .
consequently , my group , too , has tabled amendments that would make all voting electronic .
this would enable us to avoid mistakes and at the same time ensure that we have a quorum .
the socialist group in the european parliament will support this report .
initiative reports will have to take second place legislation needs to come first .
this is excellent .
this reform is essential .
fr mr president , although excellent , mr corbett's report unfortunately includes a serious error .
our aim is to provide high quality parliamentary services .
why ?
now the committee is proposing that all final votes on legislative proposals be conducted as roll call votes .
and quite rightly , too !
this report was actually split into two .
secondly , when it comes to amendments , these are now prohibited for own initiative reports .
i think that is also a welcome adjustment to the procedures that we have at the moment .
may I also confirm that lots of new ideas have come from other members .
i had grave reservations about the amendment that was submitted in the committee .
i am happy to support the one that has been submitted to plenary .
i am going to talk about petitions .
we have established the right to withdraw from a petition .
we have therefore tried to simplify things by giving a kind of admissibility incentive .
the same holds true if confidentiality is requested during discussions .
it will of course retain this right provided that there is no objection by the conference of presidents .
the electronic register has been retained .
the information collected will naturally be supplied to the commission , the council and the petitioner .
you can understand both sides .
i really have no understanding of how she could reach such a conclusion .
it is a compromise .
this will probably be the last report that mr onesta will make here in parliament .
i would like to make a few remarks about his last report .
lastly , I would like to say that I agree with our chairman , mr leinen .
mr leinen , you are absolutely right it was a slip of the tongue .
we simply opted to strengthen coordination in this scenario .
i will continue my linguistic explanations with mr botopoulos's question .
i think that , with those clarifications made , we can conclude , mr president .
the quicker the money gets to the farmers and regions , the greater the benefit from this financial assistance .
i would also like to thank the sector organisations for the proposals they made .
this would really be a very opportune moment to assess the current situation and reconsider many energy problems .
this risk remains high to this day .
this is clearly the case here too .
we correctly rectified this in the negotiations and in the trialogue of 2 april .
we need more flexibility , more manoeuvrability in the multiannual budgetary procedure .
we expect nothing less !
we are confident that the projects will be implemented as scheduled .
in particular , the gas crises needed a quick response .
the proposal forms part of the european economic recovery plan .
fellow members , our european economies and our infrastructure depend on good access to energy .
this is why I would like to stress once again the need for a common european union energy policy .
i would like to end by congratulating the rapporteur for her fine work .
we have had months of sometimes intense negotiations with the eu council .
where , finally , is the highly proclaimed solidarity across the european union ?
a keynesian recovery is needed to respond to a cyclical downturn , but this crisis is structural .
the tool , then , is inadequate .
firstly , an energy market is not relevant .
over a large distance , energy loss is proportionate to the distance travelled .
the likelihood of breakdowns and outages grows with the geographical complexity of the network .
the measures implemented and financed from this package should therefore help prevent a repeat of this crisis .
ladies and gentlemen , I am coming to the end of my political career .
it has been a pleasure to work with you all .
farmers are naturally aware of their responsibility towards society .
with this in mind , I wish the european union all the best for the future .
applause 
marilyn monroe once saidlead me not into temptation , I can find it myself.
i would like to thank the rapporteur , who has done a good job , and my fellow members .
that is the only really convincing form of politics that we can present to our citizens .
we need equivalent living conditions in towns and cities and in the country .
cutting subsidies is certainly the wrong approach if we wish to safeguard vital rural areas and lower middleclass structures .
it is very important that we deal with thisfive billionpackage .
broadband in particular means that lots of small businesses can be developed in the rural areas .
what has happened to the eur 15 billion announced via new actions and entrusted to the eib ?
that will not be permitted by parliament .
moreover , the council still has to agree to release these margins .
the measures put forward will undoubtedly be useful , but the funding still remains insecure .
what I would like to know is what are we giving priority to ?
thank you .
above all , there is not much left over for rural areas .
it also entails a transfer of funds from the agricultural budget to rural development .
above all , it is left to the discretion of the member states to create compensation programmes .
on this point , we must all act jointly in a very responsible manner .
thank you .
however , once again , I feel obliged to express two reservations in this regard .
so thank you , commissioner , for your accessibility and cooperation .
it should be understood that european diplomats spent several weeks debating the specific shape of the package .
the fact is that some of the issues remain unresolved .
and voters would surely count that against us come the next gas crisis .
it is very good .
lt I would like to talk about the macroeconomic impact of this package .
this package is important because it boosts our common market's liquidity .
such a package is needed not as some sort of subsidy or aid .
however , I think that more must be invested in modernising the infrastructure for producing and transporting electrical energy .
cooperation between member states on energy issues has been rather complicated .
mr paparizov mentioned bulgaria .
the question is why it was not developed .
you also need companies to deal with this .
it is also important to underline the solidarity in the distribution of the money .
so broadband is one of the issues for the future .
this demonstrates that we are reacting in a sufficiently strategic manner , knowing the sensitivity of this whole question .
once again I thank everyone for their support and I urge you to vote and support this package .
i therefore cannot allow you to speak now , the debate is closed .
i am sorry .
a sum of eur 3.5 billion has been allocated for this .
will this programme contribute to overcome the crisis ?
i doubt it .
in my opinion however , the projects should include energy connections between poland and germany .
this is particularly disturbing , when the food security of the european union is under threat .
the various solar energy projects , in particular , would have deserved to receive financing .
it may also help to gain additional income , especially in small , family holdings .
the second step is that we must now achieve stronger integration of financial market supervision .
the second area is securitisation , the granting of loans .
nonetheless , there is still a lot to do .
this needs financial resources .
this is a good signal .
it has been a pleasure to work with you all .
this is why the commission proposed to provide them with financial support .
we are not fully satisfied with this .
it is now recognised by the g20 as a key measure to strengthen the financial system .
adequate diversification and collateral are critical to ensuring financial stability .
much recovery is on track .
finally , you should have also decided to introduce guarantees for bank deposits .
we welcome this .
so the sooner that we can get europe's quality control securitisation working , the better .
a 10 % hit during times of ongoing capital stress would just hurt borrowers and businesses , not banks .
funding should also be sought from the user side such as investors .
on behalf of the ind / dem group . sv thank you , mr president .
we have now gone through a global financial meltdown and it is continuing to cause us problems .
we need then to analyse why this has happened before we begin to act at eu level .
we have banks that aretoo big to fail, as the catchphrase goes .
we ought to consider whether this might not be part of the solution .
we have deposit guarantees for small scale savers and even quite large scale savers .
i doubt that .
i wish to congratulate the rapporteurs and the groupsshadow rapporteurs for the compromise that has been reached .
i would like to thank mrs berès for her amendment to the proposal .
the progress achieved with the restructuring of the financial market framework is good but not yet sufficient .
the work will therefore continue .
i acknowledge that mr karas has achieved many things .
mr president , I am standing here with mixed feelings in my last debate in this house .
this is a step towards strong european supervision of the financial markets that have developed far beyond national borders .
i strongly recommend that the committee on economic and monetary affairs reinstate this process .
five per cent is not significant .
commissioner mccreevy brought up 15 % and was then beaten down to 5 % by the industry .
the council went along with this and the european parliament cut a very sorry figure indeed .
will various countries contribute to a joint fund ?
in the months to come , I look forward to continuing this work with you in the new parliament .
the basel committee will work on quantitative retention . this has been required by the glet me just make a point concerning securitisation .
mrs bowles made a pretty strong contribution in this regard .
people know my views on this .
in other words , the debate will continue , it has to continue .
i wish all those who will voluntarily not be returning all the best for the future .
this is my last speech , as I have already said .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place today , wednesday 6 may 200written statements rule 142 
the presidency was able to reject this immediately as incorrect .
it is an accusation of a serious criminal offence .
i demand the retraction of this accusation , an apology and a condemnation by the presidency .
applause 
i see that mr hans peter martin would like the floor .
i give it to you briefly .

i have the right to make a personal comment under rule 1i absolutely reject what my fellow member has just uttered .
i stand by it .
and if I am being accused ..
but that is what the right wing extremists are like .
the president cut off the speaker 
thank you , mr donnici .
are there any objections ?
i find this unacceptable .
cfp repeal of 14 obsolete regulations 
the petitions process amendment of title viii of the rules of procedure 
draft amending budget no 5 / 2009 
general revision of the rules of procedure 
our committee complied with the conclusions of the reform group point by point .
i think it would be more helpful for us if we were to proceed that way around .
voting time
for the results and other details on the vote see minutes . 
for many of you this will be your last week in strasbourg .
applause 
that is what I have striven for .
ladies and gentlemen , we have also placed tackling climate change at the top of the political agenda .
one often hears that others are taking the lead in tackling climate change .
it is now at the heart of a european parliamentary democracy unimaginable in 197together we have advanced parliamentary democracy in the european union and beyond .
the european parliament and national parliaments are now partners .
now parliament also participates in the institutional and constitutional deliberations of the summits .
this is a huge step forward .
the work was completed successfully .
together we have succeeded in adapting the working methods of the european parliament to changing political circumstances .
it is the supreme value .
applause 
you are worthy of our thanks , our support and our appreciation .
we have just had another meeting of the conference of presidents .
the legacy of a president of the european parliament is always subject to political scrutiny .
you have presented your conclusions .
there is nothing to add .
the question therefore remains what has the president , as a human being , done for this house ?
this house does not always conduct itself with dignity . but that is true of all parliaments worldwide .
loud applause 
that is a record to be proud of and a legacy on which your successors should build .
applause 
others have an international dimension , such as the conflict in the middle east , which you mentioned .
it is vital .
what kind of a parliament is this ?
if you believed in democracy , you would not just bulldoze aside those three referendum results .
our right to do so was set out unequivocally in the rules of procedure .
this is not the time to have that argument all over again .
my friends , I hope that there will be many more of us souverainistes here in july .
applause 
there will be many new members .
i should also like to congratulate you on 30 years as an elected member of the european parliament .
is it not necessary to hold these candidates to account ?
this is very important for both the harbour and the trautmann reports .
mrs dahl , as far as I am aware there is no problem .
that is why we have withdrawn the amendment .
throughout the negotiations on this compromise , I have worked faithfully and harmoniously with all of the political groups .
that is the consequence of the vote that is being taken today .
the revised directive will not enter into force before the end of the next legislative term .
european globalisation adjustment fund 
economic recovery programme energy projects 
protection of animals at the time of killing 
the agriculture committee has proposed to remove the obligation to create the reference centre at a national level .
i suggest voting on amendment 64 separately .
voting against amendment 85 will support the commission proposal to reduce the transport time .
renewed social agenda 
it is important that we try to get the maximum support for this report at the end .
we have all been here some time , as , particularly , have our interpreters .
we did consider that formula .
i voted against .
the community budget cannot be recycled using the flexibility mechanism .
the fund is also an opportunity to reduce the disproportion between old and new european union member states .
i do not understand why we have ever had this bizarre rule .
the longest serving member at least has experience to fall back on , rather than merely age .
within months he had stood down , having performed his function of bringing ridicule upon the european parliament .
we cannot , 20 years on , allow mr le pen a second opportunity to bring europe into disrepute .
the classics used to teach that to err is human to persist in error is diabolical .
the lesson has clearly not been learned .
when will the minority groups be eliminated ?
when will recalcitrant members be eliminated ?
it is , in fact , unreasonable to change a general rule to suit a specific case .
that is a shame .
i hope it will prevent the election of mr le pen and that this exercise will thus prove pointless .
they shall not have the right to vote or to stand for election to positions within parliament .
afterwards , each can then lay the blame on the other person .
one month from the european elections , that is a strong sign .
mr sarkozy and his friends in themajorshave some respite .
this type of behaviour can only be encouraged .
social insurance is a matter of national competence and for this reason I voted against amendment self employment remains a minority form of employment in europe , accounting for 16 % of the working population .
only one third of selfemployed workers are women .
however , it is worth pointing out that the stringent proposals made seek primarily to ensure minimum levels .
thus , the wordings do not prevent the member states from going further if they so wish .
selfemployed people currently make up only 16 % of the working population .
we are currently facing an unprecedented crisis .
the european globalisation adjustment fund egf was established in 2006 and will function until 20the purpose of the egf is to provide support for workers made redundant as a result of globalisation .
instead , an increase in assistance from eur 3.5 billion to nearly eur 4 billion is proposed !
we have voted against the report as a whole .
however , the content has become far too focussed on fossil fuels .
such projects would be cost effective and would reduce emissions and create new jobs .
however , this requires a significantly large retention .
this opens the floodgates to unfair competition against public banks in germany .
in writing . I congratulate mr karas .
mr karas can be satisfied with his work in the negotiations .
taxpayersmoney must be used wisely .
it is important , particularly during these turbulent times , for us to be careful with our common resources .
however , the present report leads us in a completely different direction .
supervision of the financial institutions within the eu is not a task for the eu at the present time .
it is important to bear this in mind .
i voted for the report on the protection of animals at the time of killing .
every year in the european union , millions of animals are killed .
however , we believe that social security schemes and the minimum wage should be determined at a national level .
therefore , conservatives have abstained on this report .
this report contains many contradictions .
the guiding principle is the same as always .
we therefore voted against the report in the final vote .
this is particularly important to enable us to deal with the problem of theworking poor.
however , conservatives do not support the concept of an eu discrimination directive .
these issues should be matters of national competence .
we have therefore tabled an alternative resolution which contains all the elements of her report which we do support .
we need to create more jobs and more capacity in our labour markets .
we now continue with the vote .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting see minutes
composition of parliament see minutes
in addition , the paragraph on remembering the holocaust was maintained in the text .
there is also a continuing need to enhance dialogue and mutual understanding and to promote tolerance .
the eu has a strong acquis on the fight against racism and xenophobia .
these examples demonstrate our collective commitment to work on this issue both internally and more widely with partners worldwide .
the durban review conference was part of those wider efforts .
as you are aware , five member states have decided against taking part in this conference .
the fight against racism and against the incitement of hate by president ahmadinejad and others deserved better .
why was europe divided ? why ?
that is the problem .
there was never any common ground , so there was never an eu position before the conference .
in any case , the european union has adopted a policy of actively fighting racism .
we are very well aware of the challenges we continue to face in this area .
this is not easy , but I would like to draw your attention to a number of successes .
more disappointingly , we failed to reintroduce the mandate of an independent expert on the drc .
this has led to positive results , in particular the follow up resolution on the death penalty .
on human rights defenders , the eu will continue to cooperate with civil society organisations .
in dialogues with third countries , freedom of expression and raising individual cases will remain central to our agenda .
this dialogue is valuable .
i am very grateful in general for the work of this parliament and its support on human rights issues .
allow me to give a few examples .
we are launching a pilot programme aimed at 10 countries on different continents .
in 2009 , we are continuing down this path with the following initiatives .
i personally place a great deal of importance on this forum .
compromises have been reached .
mentioning specific names in our resolution would be counterproductive .
the same holds true for children .
i think that sends out an important signal .
our policies are compartmentalised .
in europe , we agree that this is unacceptable , but we continue to operate double standards .
we have to put a stop to that .
things look very bad for respect for human rights in many countries worldwide .
i should also like to suggest once again that the subcommittee on human rights be made a standing committee .
it is often also the problem of values versus economic interest .
this would significantly ease relations between the eu and china .
we will therefore have to uphold our legitimate demands on china .
talks with the dalai lama , the religious leader of the tibetans , must be resumed .
madam president , my congratulations to the rapporteur and to other colleagues .
let me remind you of two examples .
today 1 600 eu citizens are still missing since the 1974 turkish invasion of cyprus .
thousands of civilians eu citizens living in these areas are subjected to .
applause 
this is a small moment of joy in our presidency .
on the death penalty , it is clear that we must make abolition the achievement of our generation .
i believe we have to double our efforts in reaching out to governments .
this is a personal commitment that is very dear to my heart .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
if you do not mind then .
thank you .
written statement rule 142 
in writing . hu mr president , ladies and gentlemen .
this is my last speech in this plenary session .
i am happy that what I am leaving now is a european union with 27 members .
it has been a unique , magnificent experience .
thank you very much , and goodbye for the last time .
this means that the issue of solidarity must be addressed in a broader context .
i must also thank the authors of the amendments .
this is the first time that parliament has given its verdict , as colegislator , on asylum issues .
i thank mr masip hidalgo once again for his excellent presentation .
we need to arrive at a fairer distribution of the beneficiaries of international protection among member states .
there are amendments with the aim of radically changing the procedure for appointing the director of the future office .
others , obviously , have invoked the principle of subsidiarity .
frankly , I do not share these criticisms .
thank you .
we cannot deny that any longer .
their publication is scheduled for 24 june .
the game being played in malta is actually not very clear , and I will explain myself straight away .
the italian government has asked malta on many occasions to reduce its huge expanse of territorial waters .
both proposals are moving in the direction of improving the european union reception system for asylum seekers .
i therefore believe that this is a benchmark for the civilisation of our political initiative and our law making capacity .
all asylum seekers should have fast access to the labour market .
i take the view that it is a matter for the member states to take this decision .
as this is not the case , approximately 95 % are simply not granted asylum .
the dublin regulation is the same in certain respects , as it promotes asylum shopping .
we want to see greater transparency and accountability , as I think the rapporteur is also striving to do .
with these safeguards , we will have a strong addition to a fair and balanced common european asylum system .
that must be a fundamental condition .
the debate on the return directive is closed we were all in agreement .
we have introduced , among other things , a mechanism to identify vulnerable persons .
obviously , the member states must ensure the fair , balanced implementation of the principles that we have suggested .
however , this regulation cannot serve as a legal basis creating an intra community transfer mechanism .
we hope that we can get this office up and running as soon as possible .
europe cannot turn its back on its commitments to countries that once were recklessly exploited .
hopefully the european asylum support office will help to ease the burden of the member states concerned .
the next item is the joint debate on
what , though , is the origin of the issue that we are concerned with today ?
personally , mr president , I am not a great legal expert .
that really is the main ingredient of mutual recognition .
it is thanks to these things that we will be able to implement the new eurojust decision quickly .
congratulations on your report , mrs pagano .
this is a fundamental issue that I wished to introduce into this debate .
i would like to tell you about an example of this close to us here in europe .
if defiance of strasbourg happens , then the fundamental rights safeguards in the european arrest warrant must be invoked .
lastly , I must honestly say that I have some doubts about mrs pagano's european parliament recommendation .
i do not wish to prolong the debate .
this is indeed a desirable development .
mr president , when we began this work we were aware that we were walking on thin ice .
there were strong opposing winds in your country .
today you have served the european cause well !
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday , at 12 noon .
the council appreciates all similar efforts by the european parliament to the same end .
es thank you very much for your answer , mr president .
subject climate change
you started your presidency with the reputation of being climate sceptics .
the poles and the germans also have a bit of tidying up to do .
again , thank you .
de mr president , I congratulate the czech presidency on the decision in the senate .
subject croatia , macedonia and southeast europe
forecasts of the conclusion of the negotiating process cannot be made .
maintaining good neighbourly relations , including a negotiated and mutually acceptable solution on the main issue , remains essential .
in december 2008 montenegro filed its membership application .
second , will you name a date for macedonia this year ?
third , what is the timeframe for relaxing visa restrictions ?
it has been one of the main goals of this presidency since the outset to unblock this situation .
many thanks .
lt I too would like to thank you for your comprehensive reply .
subject health care abroad
in the council's view , how can these opposing positions of parliament and the council be reconciled ?
what possible compromise proposals does the council envisage ?
however , it depends on the member statesnational policy .
yes , let us applaud the czech senate all the way from strasbourg to prague .
we are very pleased with this outcome .
that is not true of everyone , though .
applause 
the treaty thereby strengthens the community method and transforms it into the union method .
furthermore , that method will be extended to the former justice and home affairs pillar .
that the parliaments of 26 countries have ratified the treaty of lisbon shows that it is a parliamentary treaty .
that is why they tell the lies that they tell .
and it was no meagre majority it was 54 that is a gigantic lead for those who said yes to the treaty of lisbon .
there are many opportunities open to national parliaments through their right of veto .
this will be the last budgetary report of this parliamentary term and my last parliamentary report .
speaking about the treaty of lisbon in this house is not a denial of democracy , rather the contrary .
that is the whole thrust of this report simplification and clarification of the budgetary challenges of the treaty .
first of all , modifications to the primary legislation .
in addition , changes are made to the new multiannual financial framework that strengthen parliament's role .
this is real progress .
their inclusion in the convention's draft constitution was neither a sure fire thing nor the result of chance .
the time has come for direct democracy in a united europe .
today's vote brings to 26 the number of member states whose parliaments have backed the treaty .
the reports are particularly valuable in deepening our thinking on how the treaty should work in practice .
still , this is not enough .
however , these methods can only be agreed once the vice president and high representative has taken office .
citizens will be able to call on the commission to bring forward new policy initiatives .
if so requested , this practice must also apply to the special representatives .
we affirm that this service should be assigned to the commission for administrative purposes .
so national parliaments are greatly affected by the changes afoot .
i think it is good that we will have the treaty of lisbon .
that is why the controversial treaty of lisbon may be perceived positively from the perspective of local authorities .
under the treaty , more effective consultations with local and regional authorities and their associations are required .
you all know that the czech republic's view is critical yet realistic .
this mentality is clearly one of the reasons why we are debating tonight .
it is one of the most sensitive areas in the constitution .
applause 
a day will come when federal and cosmopolitan parliaments will join to govern the world .
the sublime dignity of man is now the principle that brings together national and international law .
you have already thanked a few who are unfortunately no longer with us .
first , I thank johannes voggenhuber , a veritable cornerstone of our work for democracy and civil rights .
carlos carnero gonzález was always with us .
and , last but not least although she is not a member of the committee catherine guy quint .
the commission should exercise its right of initiative and draft a bill very soon after the reorganisation .
thank you , mr dehaene .
it is the best treaty that can be agreed at this time .
that was not the agreement .
i am giving my last speech after 15 years .
it has been a great honour .
allow me to , perhaps , take a look into the future .
without a major crisis you will never manage to create a real european democracy , a real political community .
we really do need a major crisis.
but we have it .
yes , we did not dismount from the barricades , the governments simply said njet .
and the citizensinitiatives ?
why ?
there are a number of regulations in this area .
there ispermanent structured cooperationenabling a military core europe .
only one would never call it that today .
conditions have changed fundamentally .
ireland has decided .
sv I will now switch to my own language .
it should be complicated .
this is what the american constitution is like .
so much for democracy !
we are no better on the rule of law .
britain will voteno.
let me give colleagues due notice .
we will deliver a referendum and we will kill this wretched and shameful treaty stone dead .
that is precisely what today's reports are doing .
as its legislative functions are limited , this responsibility essentially falls under article 265 on the failure to act .
for them , the union is distant and unknown , even though they feel that they need it .
we have not had the time to finish our work nor to conclude our debate on this issue .
once again , my warmest thanks to the czech senate , the czech parliament and the czech government .
such accusations are an affront to the principles of friendly international relations , as well as simple human decency .
but we have plenty of time to come back to that , should the treaty indeed come into force .
we are talking on the day where we have achieved the 26th parliamentary ratification .
that is a very high hurdle to reach .
those eurosceptics over there only need one victory out of that is the way it is .
i notice they only quote the referendums that have given anoresult .
they never manage to mention the spanish referendum , the luxembourg referendum .
the two of us have been budget coordinators for our respective political groups .
i have learnt a great deal !
this is described well and clearly in mrs guy quint's report .
this would enable us always to help shape these frameworks .
parliament would have full influence over the entire budget , including the agriculture budget .
having only one reading followed by negotiations to reach agreement forces us to prepare earlier and much more carefully .
that is not such a silly idea in essence .
we simply want to ensure that relations between the institutions and the citizens are improved .
we are getting new powers in environmental protection and climate change .
as if a single nation state could solve these problems on its own !
for air and water in particular , and in various other areas too , that is just not possible .
in view of the crisis , it is particularly important that the european union be given these powers .
new legal bases are also important , however .
it makes one wonder who could have developed such a complicated system .
it has also demonstrated the strength of our commitment to take europe forward .
we are now entering a very decisive phase .
i believe that we should also be instrumental in ensuring that this is possible .
it would be foolish of us not to do so .
this union of ours is unique .
no doubt future parliaments and indeed future councils will identify and agree further reforms .
but europe also needs a new direction .
will the five year budgetary term coincide with or be accentuated by the five year parliamentary term ?
the treaty of lisbon is the stronger engine which we need to face the crisis .
could I thank , first of all , all the rapporteurs of the five reports .
i understand it has been referred to a judicial review .
you have a choice .
perhaps the steps that are being taken are not big enough .
i thank the rapporteurs for their courage and their ability to create the necessary documents .
i welcome today's decision of the czech senate approving the treaty of lisbon .
not all .
in the end they did what he said .
of those who did vote , half voted against the treaty because they had not read it .
this will probably be the lowest in the entire european union .
i am a member of the law and justice party , the largest opposition party .
the statement that there is no one here from that party is untrue .
so let us not push ahead with the lisbon treaty until every country has ratified it .
if you really want a proper democratic debate , let the people of britain have a choice .
it is really about tackling these problems , which today are not national .
these reports give us a good grounding and a good platform to reform the way we work .
applause 
thank you once again .
it was a major debate , an important debate .
three hundred and fifty representatives of the people in 26 countries have saidno.
they cannot all be fools and scatterbrains .
it is the most social european treaty there has ever been .
thank you very much .
i would still argue that we ought to broker an agreement between parliament and the council before the elections .
all of that requires conviction , time and , above all , political courage , which we are lacking .
parliament's importance in the eu's decisionmaking process has grown with each european treaty .
the treaty will bring the eu closer to its citizens .
i would like to make a few comments about the procedure for appointing the european commission .
this will help us make their accession to the eu a simpler , smoother process .
lv mr president , it was not really clear on which report I could speak now .
it is just that I did not react immediately .
the difference enables us to interpret matters .
but when we protested in favour of a referendum , 14 of us were fined .
dictatorship and manipulation?
why on earth did it get such a huge majority if it was such a negative report ?
hopefully we can correct that in the next parliament .
after all , members have a right to have their say .
but , thanks to an ecj judgment , some innocent people's data will now be returned .
the current system of domain names and registrations works brilliantly .
i think not .
twenty two years ago a corresponding directive was passed .
let me try and address this in contemporary terms , helped by a lady called kristen mccauliff .
opening on a stressed marge , it shows a sped up version of her daily routine .
local newsman kent brockman shows up to report on the situation .
therefore , there are many people who are self employed many of them women , who are often overlooked .
there is noreturn to senderfor them .
member states should ensure that assisting spouses can become members of sickness and invalidity insurance schemes and pension schemes .
fortunately my mistake did not change the final result of voting .
some meps and some political parties reject the idea of large scale investment at this time .
i stand up next to a mountain and I chop it down with the edge of my hand . 
i think we can all learn from that .
they display a professionalism from which a lot of members of this parliament could learn .
secondly , I would ask the presidency to look again at the rules .
it really alarms me that we have arbitrarily set aside what our rules of procedure plainly state .
if we want to change that rule , then that is fine .
is that our community of values ?
we can work it out together .
et sometimes it is good to be first , and sometimes it is good to be last .
we have spoken extensively about flexibility in labour market policy .

media mundus audiovisual cooperation programme with professionals from third countries debate 
the media mundus programme we are discussing today is a fantastic response .
that is always a win win situation for people from third countries within europe .
so it will create new business opportunities for professionals from europe and around the globe .
all in all , this is a project that helps all sides .
it was high time this happened .
mr president , commissioner , mrs hieronymi , I should like to extend my sincere congratulations on this report .
this needs the financial support we are giving .
i should especially like to thank mrs hieronymi and wish her all the best .
she has been an excellent colleague and media expert .
this is , of course , a good concept .
therefore it is no surprise that it is losing .
europe's small share in the worldwide circulation of audiovisual works is a significant example of this .
however , we do not have to rend our garments .
initiatives like the programme we are discussing are a small but necessary step .
i congratulate mrs hieronymi on her report .
that is why I am pleased that we have succeeded in getting this programme off the ground .
because that is what moves people in their hearts and minds .
some of you know that you will be coming back .
it has been enjoyable and pleasant working for you .
thank you for your cooperation .
the worldwide development of the european film industry is made possible thanks to this new media mundus programme .
in fact , this programme is rooted in a policy .
i congratulate the rapporteur and wish her every success in her life after the european parliament .
a few years ago our film industry was in the doldrums .
it was cooperation with third countries which helped get it back on its feet again .
for the rest , I believe that film is the best vehicle for cultural diversity .
we should therefore support this sector , which is still in its infancy .
pl mr president , films from third countries are fairly often distributed in poland .
so here we can see very concrete action .
the debate is closed .
there are two aims to our stimulus and our input .
the landfill must be re covered by a final layer in order to prevent the dispersion of fibres .
measures must be taken to prevent any possible use of the land after the closure of the landfill .
waste containing asbestos is hazardous waste .
the current economic crisis cannot justify this extension .
the purpose of the resolution before us is not to quash the comitology decision to which it refers .
asbestos should have been banned operationally by the member states applying the 1999 directive .
whyyesin some states andnoin others ?
the european parliament is doing its bit to compensate for the failings of others .
thank you for those words .
asbestos is very often safe while it is covered .
applause 
thank you very much , mr bowis .
author . it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , my sentiments exactly .
i , too , would like to make a personal comment .
furthermore , let me remind you , the commission will conduct a general review in 20the debate is closed .
i recognise the perilous state that the aviation industry and airlines in particular face .
they may even be above board , but these deals done outside of the committee .
they have to cut flight costs .
lowering the 80 % threshold to 75 % would not solve our problems .
thank you , mr blokland .
it is right that we react quickly in such critical situations and try to find sensible solutions .
on the first day of school you normally get a school bag .
this regulation has been of benefit to no one and has protected no one .
thank you , mr rack .
that is why I support the suspension of this 80 / 20 rule .
thank you , mr fernandes .
parliament has called on the european commission to produce a coherent master plan for increasing airport capacity .
traffic at european airports does not only come from europe .
it is , however , the crisis that prompts this urgent intervention .
this is therefore a difficult situation .
as regards the regulations on supervision , we must strengthen the monitoring and application of regulation 26on the basis of this evaluation we will draw conclusions as to the future .
it is this gentleman who has the formidable task of carrying out this semantic classification .
quite simply because paul dunstan speaks 27 languages .
i believe that we can all be very proud of the quality and dedication of our staff .
laughter 
that is as nothing compared to the comments I have had from members of his party in e mails .
i would inform you that it was indeed a point of order , under rule 145 on personal statements .
mr titley's request to take the floor before our house was fully justified .
furthermore , women are still seriously underrepresented in high level posts in the commission and the council .
in fact , there is not a single female eu special representative at the moment .
for this reason , the report stresses that the eu needs to fully implement its commitments in this field .

please , please .
before the vote on paragraph 25
to that extent it was already topical in 2008 and what was said is particularly unfortunate .
i will read amendment 2 aloud .
the oral amendment was not accepted 
after the vote on amendment 16
yes , please excuse me , it was a slip of the tongue .
indeed , the majority was against .
it was worth having it checked , but the services had already rectified my mistake .
before the vote
mr president , first of all , I would like to make a technical remark .
it was in that sense that I agreed to this amendment .
relations between the european parliament and national parliaments under the treaty of lisbon 
after the vote
that is a real shame !
i hope that group rights will follow as quickly as possible .
i am grateful to this house for the understanding for minorities that has been forthcoming .
lt I voted in favour of mr leinen's report and resolution for the following reasons .
i do not know whether that is going to work .
if they now give in to the european parliament , I think they would be diminished as a people .
they do not turn up to this house .
that is an absolute disgrace .
there is no easy response to this issue either .
equally , we have to address the poverty around the world which contributes to migratory pressures .
mr president , I rise in support of the costa report .
it is not unusual for airlines to hoard airport slots .
let me share an example with you birmingham airport in my constituency .
ro the situation in the republic of moldova is now clear .
i would like to clearly say to the council that we must not be under any illusion .
in fact , history shows us that these actions must be vigorous .
the prüm treaty was forced into european law without proper democratic scrutiny .
this will fill few people with confidence .
it much prefers to tell them how we feel what they should want .
what people do care about here is time .
the answer is very simple to deny the british people a say on this matter .
fortunately , I am led to believe that that vote in the uk will come quite quickly .
so rush through what you like here .
the people of britain will get their say .
the sovereignty of a parliament is shorthand for the sovereignty of the people .
i voted for the report on gender mainstreaming in eu external relations .
therefore , british conservatives abstained on this report .
the report gathers opinions from different committees concerning the changes that the treaty of lisbon will entail .
i voted for mr leinen's report .
it also forms part of the anti democratic process and campaign aiming to impose this unacceptable draft treaty .
such is our hypocritical and cynical european democracy .
the majority in this parliament refuses to acknowledge its political losses .
the electorate in the member states still feels little involvement with the super centralist european parliament .
i do not believe that the european parliament should have greater influence on the eu budget .
i have voted against the report .
we social democrats welcome any initiative that improves the situation of asylum seekers and people with no documents .
this regulation establishes a procedure for the negotiation and conclusion of bilateral agreements between member states and third countries .
this proposal allows the commission to authorise the conclusion of such agreements .
however , I , personally , will be voting in favour of it .
there are many moldovans who have applied for romanian nationality .
we should help moldova on this road .
i wish to draw attention to two parts of the world firstly , central asia .
i voted for the annual report on human rights in the world 200this report essentially has two objectives .
i do not understand the authors of that amendment .
there are , unfortunately , a great many cases of the violation of human rights in the world .
the catholic church and many other confessions are our allies in the fight to ensure respect for human dignity .
attacking the pope is only evidence of pre election cynicism and harmful radicalism .
an independent foreign policy is essential for maintaining national sovereignty .
the present report contains a number of important statements supporting specific aspects of human rights .
however , the report as a whole is a means of promoting the eu's positions on foreign policy .
moreover , I am opposed to the aim of having joint structures and personnel for creating actual eu embassies .
i believe that the eu does not have competence in this area nor should it have .
there is little evidence that promoting the use of condoms actually prevents the transmission of aids .
let us reject this amendment .
therefore , we cannot support this proposal .
in writing . criminal justice is rightly the responsibility of eu member states .
people in my region do not want to see that occurring .
what about the inextricable differences between the legislations deriving from common law and those from written law ?
we fully respect each member state's right to decide for itself whether to ratify the treaty of lisbon .
the majority in this parliament refuses to acknowledge its political losses .
i voted for mr brok's report .
this report shows how important this new treaty of the european union is .
it would be a laughing matter if it were not so serious .
mr brok's report praises the convention that produced a draft constitutional treaty .
i voted for the report on the implementation of the citizensinitiative .
and , in any case , there is absolutely no obligation for the commission to listen to them .
it is also one of the many initiatives aiming to impose the unacceptable draft treaty of lisbon .
the majority in this parliament refuses to acknowledge its political losses .
mrs kaufmann's report counts its chickens before they are hatched .
in this situation there is no point in discussing this report in the european parliament .
the latter can choose to disregard these initiatives entirely if it suits them .
i have voted against the report .

iran the case of roxana saberi
the next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on iran the case of roxana saberi .
the fact is that ms saberi has had no access to her lawyer for more than a month .
there was no chance of a fair or transparent trial , because the trial was held in camera .
she was on hunger strike for at least two weeks .
that , too , is part of our message .
two and a half minutes , madam president .
some of our countries in the west are not free from blame for this situation .
we appeal for her to be given a fair trial .
we know that for five weeks she was denied access to a lawyer .
this time we are concerned about the unlawful imprisonment of roxana saberi .
the iranian government organised a one day closed door trial without witnesses or concrete , publicly declared charges .
we must recognise that iranian fundamentalists continue to organise political trials in an attempt to further intimidate free thinkers .
the medieval torture and execution of women even pregnant women and children is commonplace .
shame on them and shame on the brutal mullahs .
it was exactly that kind of approach in the past which led to the birth of the current regime .
madam president , I wish to support my colleague even though he is scottish struan stevenson .
there are many iranians who are decent and good people .
we can merely shout in rage against this form of brutality , this form of inhumanity .
also in this case the eu issued a statement strongly condemning the execution .
the bias and manipulation of the trial and the accused were a travesty of any sense of justice .
madagascar is a country with which we work closely and intensively .
applause 
that made his position untenable .
a minority government of a totally different political persuasion then took power , but nobody considered that a coup .
such an outcome is also possible in madagascar , provided that an election is held within the foreseeable future .
but , of course , by 1996 he had been impeached for corruption and the abuse of power .
this unconstitutional change of government is a serious setback for democratisation .
madam president , the political crisis in madagascar has led to an unconstitutional change of government .
president ravalomanana lost support , and he stood down on 17 march 200power was seized by rajoelina , who was designated by the army .
the african union has suspended madagascar from membership , and is critical of the removal of ravalomanana by force .
we call for restoration of constitutional order in madagascar .
the malagasy supreme court stated that the former mayor of antananarivo holds this office in accordance with the constitution .
many other colonies of european countries have suffered or are still suffering for the same reason .
my own country , cyprus , is one .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
venezuela the case of manuel rosales
i hope the eu will not let them down .
arresting the opposition is an even stronger signal .
venezuela is obliged to respect conventions which it has signed in which it guaranteed to respect human rights .
madam president , 20 years ago socialism collapsed at the pan european picnic on the austro hungarian border .
i have met manuel rosales .
long live a free venezuela !
at first , hugo chávez did not talk about socialism but only about the right to a better world .
his opponents were not invited to cooperate and they became his mortal enemies and later on political prisoners .
the case of manuel rosales only confirms what I am saying .
other leaders playing the same game as hugo chávez include castro's heirs , lukashenko and the like .
this is especially visible in third countries .
we can adopt suitable resolutions and even give them public effect .
we are europeans .
the commission is aware of the case of manuel rosales .
i wish to assure parliament that the commission will continue to follow developments in venezuela closely .
debates on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law

we have a climate crisis that has already resulted in climate refugees .
we see an eu and a world full of injustice and poverty .
on the contrary , in many areas it has helped to create the crises .
we need a policy that safeguards the participation of all citizens .
i want to see an eu that takes responsibility for ensuring fair and responsible international trade .
i want to see a diverse europe .
this is our opportunity .
applause 
the fight for human and civil rights has always been at the heart of my activity .
since 2004 , I have been a member of the european parliament .
it so happens that all of these matters are also our priorities during this current term of office .
we need to do everything we can to change this .

mario , I know how important for you human rights are .
applause

applause 
mr president , on behalf of our group I would like to congratulate you on your election .
it is the wish of our group that your presidency will be based on these values .
you should be aware of that .
applause 
the only request we have is to use it , this large pro european majority .
i was very pleased to hear you say that we need to get closer to our citizens .
the situation there also needs to improve .
we welcome you .
i come from eastern germany and work near słubice .
two of my sons speak polish .
andrzej wajda and other polish directors are part of our european culture .
mr president , you have our respect and our support !
i think the signs for change here are not very good .
the future of european democracy rests very heavily on irish shoulders .
mr president , you fought against the soviet union .
listen to the people , please .
thank you for your speech , mr farage .
european parliamentarianism has always provided a forum for various opinions .

i will be in touch with you about this .
the european council report and the commission statement on the outcome of the european council 18 19 june 2009 
please allow me to say a few words at the outset .
yesterday we inaugurated the seventh term of the european parliament .
the czech presidency has come to an end and a new european parliament is just starting out .
on the contrary , I see it rather as a confirmation of continuity in european politics .
we selected the motto ofeurope without barriersto represent this effort symbolically .
the czech republic itself successfully completed the ratification of the treaty of lisbon by both chambers of parliament .
during the czech presidency major progress was achieved in restoring confidence .
the continuity necessary to the work of the entire eu is again apparent here .
there was ample confirmation of this during the course of the czech presidency .
i would also mention the review of the globalisation adjustment fund .
over the last six months we have made much progress , for example by developing the baltic interconnection plan .
the european project has always been a long term one .
this is the reason why I am going to be working here in the european parliament .
i think that the czech republic managed very well in resolving the gas crisis of january this year .
the june summit is proof of this , since the entire agenda of the summit was successfully implemented .
prime minister , your predecessor did not have an easy or positive start .
that was and still is a real danger .
many people want to use the crisis to promote a new economic nationalism .
the whole of europe looked to prague in amazement .
with this move , the czech political class did a disservice both to its own country and to europe .
i do not think that this is something we ought to be proud of .
what are the reasons for this ?
applause 
i would also like to stress the importance of the eastern partnership initiative and its implementation .
of course you have been supported by mr barroso on that .
it is all about him and the eu institutions getting more power at the expense of the member states .
i am of course referring to the visit of václav klaus .
so at least for václav klaus we thank you very much for the last six months .
president of the commission . madam president , I should just like to put a question .
i am not criticising , but is it allowed to have flags in the chamber ?
mr farage held up a union flag . 
even the treaty of lisbon was only half heartedly criticised and delayed by the prague leadership .
croatia does not deserve that .
overall , our conclusions about the success of the czech presidency are somewhat mixed .
criticisms have been levelled here at the pace of financial market regulation .
i hope it will be final , decisive and correct .
personally I considered it a great challenge for my cabinet and for myself as well .
the teams showed that these interests are not mutually exclusive , even in times of crisis .
in addition , they convinced the french president , among others , that protectionism is a dirty word .
however , the czech presidency was particularly wrong on the directive on maternity leave .
i know what I am talking about , because I was the rapporteur for this report .
men have just as much right to see their children develop as women have to enjoy career success .
the exact same treaty of lisbon that 53 % of the voters rejected .
the truth is that we are paying the price for indecision .
the czech presidency had two faces and symbolically it had two premiers .
ga be prepared for a vigorous campaign against the treaty of lisbon in ireland .
i ask myself in all seriousness have we really become so modest in our expectations ?
he did of course promote the importance of national sovereignty here in parliament .
i should like to defend your honour against one of my irish colleagues , joe higgins .
the treaty of lisbon contains a horizontal social clause .
i would like to thank you for your contributions to the discussion .
once again , I wish you every success in your work .
i discussed this issue with the canadian prime minister in the margins of the last g8 meeting .
written statements rule 149 
in the eu , this crisis is the result of neoliberal policies which are still being pursued .
free and unregulated movement of capital and the existence of offshore financial centres 
there are great expectations of you .
i am addressing you during a challenging period .
rarely has the eu cooperation faced harsher tests and tests so varied in nature .
one thing is clear .
he was driven by a firm conviction that sweden belonged in europe .
it enabled me to see how european cooperation worked in practice .
this has in turn had an effect on the swedish population .
that is a victory for all of us who believe in european cooperation .
applause 
there would also be other serious consequences , however .
our climate is under threat from both our use of and our dependence on fossil fuels .
although time is short , it is still on our side .
we will improve public finances while at the same time households will have greater resources .
our investments in the green economy will create new job opportunities and drive growth in the decades ahead .
applause 
twelve years ago a coalition of the willing was formed in kyoto .
neither is it sufficient to have solutions that are based only on restrictions in the most developed countries .
that is why we must discuss the financing of investments in the developing countries .
in addition , we will need clear commitments in the medium term for countries outside europe too .
i know that the european parliament will accept its responsibility .
we agreed on a common recovery plan to stimulate the economy .
so what can we do ?
we must quickly get effective supervision in place to prevent similar crises occurring in the future .
the swedish presidency will work towards agreement on this in the council by the end of the year .
we are hoping for your help in achieving this quickly and conclusively .
our citizens will not accept the repeated use of tax revenues to rescue financial institutions that have acted irresponsibly .
mass unemployment , social unrest and growing tax pressure then await us .
we must also concentrate on reforms , modernisation and adaptation to a new reality .
that is something we should acknowledge and accept .
in the wake of the economic crisis we can see ideas of increased protectionism .
international criminality is growing ever stronger .
this is a threat to our democratic values and a threat to our citizens .
a flexible system for labour immigration could bring together these two realities .
we will act as anhonest broker.
these days the world's problems come knocking on the eu's door .
let us together meet their expectations .
i want to see a europe that takes responsibility for the economy .
lending for spendingcannot be the only motto .
such a europe will be strong whatever the times .
let us do so with vision and drive , with initiative and courage .
this dream makes europe strong .
loud applause 
the european union's collective action has led to an unprecedented fiscal effort that is producing concrete results .
we need to put into practice the shared commitment to youth and to employment .
you will have heard about the progress made at these meetings .
we also need to make progress on the necessary means to support developing countries and boost technology transfer .
it is important to discuss procedure , but I believe it is even more important to discuss substance .
during these last 50 years europe has consistently exceeded expectations , confounding doubts .
job security is vital for the internal stability of society .
as you have just said , you travel a lot in sweden and in europe .
we therefore need initiatives from the european union .
wonderful !
in that case , I would like to know which country will have no commissioner .
then we can vote on everything else on the basis of the treaty of lisbon .
great ! 
you will see that in a few seconds my six minutes will be up .
this must be your absolute priority .
how far have we come ?
mr barroso , what happened to your forceful intervention ?
we have seen no evidence of them .
applause 
since we have respect for democracy , we should respect the vote of the irish people .
transparency is needed in particular when combating the crisis we are currently experiencing .
those who bask in innocence do nothing to combat the crisis .
we must also perhaps avoid making comparisons your country borders norway I live near switzerland .
mr president , this parliament spends its time regulating matters that should be determined in the member states themselves .
we also want to see the negotiations with turkey brought to an immediate end .
turkey is an islamic country and the islamic ideology is completely at odds with our western culture .
i know that a number of you were elected with very strong support .
it is important to be able to represent your respective groups strongly .
this was done by eu minister cecilia malmström .
let me say that we are putting jobs first .
we are having this discussion in sweden , and it is also taking place around europe .
the average spent in europe on such commitments is 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product .
sweden is fairly unique in that one per cent of our gross domestic product goes to development aid .
mr president , some important questions have been asked I shall try to answer them very briefly .
the treaty in force is the treaty of nice .
with your support I believe we can achieve success at the copenhagen conference .
i would like to take this perspective one step further .
trade union rights must take precedence over free movement .
it must do more to help those who are affected by the crisis .
this falls under your remit , and it is very important for the credibility of our institutions .
how are you going to deal with the ippc directive on industrial emissions ?
how are you going to deal with illegal felling ?
the same applies to my hometown and the stockholm programme .
then we will have made progress .
mr president , I would like to congratulate the swedish presidency for prioritising economic challenges .
they need workable and defined legislative timetables , prioritisation of legislation and proper consultation .
prime minister and fellow members , thank you for your account of the presidency's programme .
the crises have their origin in political decisions made .
neither have we heard anything about the famous progressive equality policy .
fi mr president , ladies and gentlemen , sweden has always respected human rights and democracy .
i am very pleased that you mentioned the baltic sea , and I fully support you in this matter .
the baltic sea is in difficulties it is dying and it needs to be saved .
after all , it is exciting ideas that lie behind at the birth of social change .
it is therefore so very important to continue to build towards a sustainable economy and towards preventing climate change .
it is good that you give such a high priority to this in your programme .
you mentioned that this enlargement process will be slower than many people on both sides would have wished .
however , the appropriate preparations must naturally be made by these countries .
the level of unemployment that we are seeing today in europe has not yet reached its maximum .
you have a lot on your plate .
the energy policy , just as some have said , requires both realism and solidarity .
no new gas crises , no unilateral dependence .
here sweden has a great responsibility to bring what is known as the telecoms package to a successful conclusion .
the rule of law must also apply in the virtual world .
now this will not be the case , and I am sorry for that .
now is the time for political leadership and drive .
the euro has proved its strength .
thank you , and as we say in my party good luck !
the most important thing is that we achieve the emission reduction targets for 20i would like , however , to draw attention to three challenges .
the first of these is european solidarity , which is especially important at a time of financial crisis .
we cannot allow situations to arise in which particular european countries are treated unequally .
secondly , we are glad that the baltic sea strategy is one of the priorities of the swedish presidency .
i am sure that the swedish presidency will be equal to these challenges .
i am , of course , referring to the second referendum .
thank you very much and good luck in a difficult time of upheaval .
today the ministers are meeting in stockholm to discuss the stockholm programme .
furthermore , I believe that our work in strasbourg must be discontinued .
the next six months are crucial for europe's citizens and for the european union .
many proposals and new programmes are being put forward .
we need a breakthrough in the climate change summit in december .
i am confident the irish people will tell this particular circus what they told libertas get lost !
it therefore requires a differentiated approach .
speech interrupted 
this is not an easy time for europe it is full of challenges .
thank you for your attention .
third , for estonia the stockholm programme is important .
i believe that the baltic sea strategy could increase the legitimacy of the entire eu .
the baltic sea strategy can also help to check the crime trend and trafficking .
president barack obama gave an extraordinary speech about africa in africa the other day .
let them not distract you from your mission , your purpose .
i believe that we must concentrate on the essentials .
the first of these priorities is the unequivocal opposition to discrimination , racism , anti semitism , xenophobia and homophobia .
it is regrettable that the swedish presidency is resigning itself to the informal and disputed framework of the gthose in favour of the treaty cannot afford to be complacent in any way .
the president cut off the speaker 
i would also like to thank him for sweden's engagement in development of the eastern partnership .
allow me to thank you for having represented your respective party groups very well .
a number of the ministers in my cabinet are here with me today .
it is very important for the european parliament .
to force through those outdated policies now would be disastrous , for it would make the crisis worse .
quite the contrary .
people are losing their jobs , many businesses are going bankrupt , while national budgets are in major deficit .
the eu's swedish presidency has a huge responsibility towards its citizens .
the swedish presidency is seeking to speed up capitalist restructurings , within the framework of the lisbon strategy .
de mr president , I think you need to explain something .
we are at present conducting a test .
i just wanted to reiterate this as it has confused many members .
the composition of the new bureau shall be notified to the presidents of the institutions of the european communities .
the next item is the vote .
the issue on our agenda at this time is iran .
in spite of the current delicate situation in iran , the commission believes strongly in maintaining a dialogue .
we should strive for engagement with iran at all levels .
our present differences with the government of iran are many some are very serious .
everyone knows the facts all too well , so I will not dwell on that .
dialogue , even if a very difficult dialogue .
the crucial nuclear question is on hold , and we ask the question what is the way forward ?
that does not represent british people's views that is not europe's attitude towards islam .
what is more , iran is located in one of the most sensitive areas on the planet .
such is the case for the iranian people .
why are we not prepared to put tougher sanctions in place ?
not even the most recent developments in iran justify plans for military action against iranian nuclear installations .
the government of a sovereign state must openly accept the desire for change and drive through a political solution .
secondly , because of the strong influence that religious extremism exerts on the political power of the islamic republic .
the european union needs to maintain a united front and continue to condemn the abuses committed in iran .
we need to fully involve russia and china , which are permanent members of the security council .
the iranian people want freedom and we must support the call for free elections under un supervision .
we must demonstrate that we do not cooperate with dictatorships .
mr president , last year I served as a monitor at commemorations for the 1956 revolution in budapest .
the fairness of the election should be verified by independent external observers otherwise the election will be pointless .
i sincerely hope that mrs rajavi is right .
what a difference !
mr president , a crucial change has taken place in iran .
our first conclusions , therefore , should be that iran is not and will not be the same again .
i would also like to express concern at iran's nuclear programme .
we must be clear that our subject today is the situation of democracy and human rights in iran .
talk about new sanctions will not under any circumstances help to resolve the serious problems of the iranian people .
unfortunately , our group chairmen have rejected a motion for a resolution .
what is currently being discussed in the council and also in the member states ?
anything else will be a waste of time and will prolong this disgrace .
first of all , the iranian regime is unpredictable .
so we should hardly be surprised by the mere stealing of an election through wholesale electoral fraud .
this is , as has been pointed out , a most important debate on a most important subject .
i think we must then operate along two lines .
so we must condemn the killings , the use of the death sentence .
i come from a country where 1 % of our citizens have a background in iran .
they move back and forth .
we have consular issues that are of a multitude that is difficult to fathom .
we have the nuclear dossier that has been alluded to .
there might be others who believe there are far more simple solutions to that .
i am grateful for this debate .
we know what we want to achieve we must also seek to achieve it .
but do not think it is going to be easy .
the debate is closed .
china debate 
it also brings challenges of different sorts .
we have the annual summit meetings and we have fairly frequent meetings at the level of foreign ministers .
we also have the annual high level dialogue on trade and economic issues .
yet china is a huge country with considerable internal challenges and differences between its regions .
we have called on all parties to show restraint and bring an immediate end to all acts of violence .
we hope the situation can be resolved peacefully through dialogue without further bloodshed .
they pose no direct terrorist threat .
therefore , delaying a solution with regard to identity delays a solution in the long term .
china's problems stem in this instance from the greying of the middle kingdom .
i saw this when I visited urumqi four years ago .
indeed , the biggest problems in europe are found in the younger democracies , like spain and hungary .
i am convinced that the european union can play an important role in working with china to these ends .
however , this is not a conflict where the two sides are equal .
in xinjiang , the region of the uighurs , there is just as little cultural autonomy as in tibet .
this can be seen from a blatant campaign by government agencies against peaceful protestant house churches of late .
thus , on 3 july , eight christians were arrested in xinjiang during a service .
in xinjiang , the internet was blocked completely , limiting communications into and out of the desert region .
the clashes between uighurs and hans have taken the official death toll to 186 , but the bloodshed continues .
of course violence by the uighurs should be condemned too .
i do not think so .
the uighurs are currently being accused of separatism .
however , is it separatism if a house is on fire and I try to escape from this house ?
however , is a people in the wrong simply because it is smaller in number ?
i do not think so .
we , as the european union , therefore have an important obligation .
we respect the chinese system .
however , that does not mean .
that is what we social democrats are calling for .
we must condemn it .
that is the road to chaos and conflict .
hu the question is where do we stand on this issue ?
are we on the side of china or tiananmen square ?
are we on the side of 1.2 billion chinese or 8 million uighurs ?
where do we stand then ?
it is obvious to me whose side I am on .
i hope that it is clear to my fellow members too .
we still have a huge amount of work to do .
we are seeing all of these seriously repressed .
when we talk about xinjiang the worduighursshould also be mentioned .
i would like to say one last thing to mr posselt .
he spoke of separatism .
so the vast majority of those killed were han chinese .
so let us base our criticism on facts and not take unfair records against the chinese .
we ought therefore to be very discriminating in our observation of this situation and investigate the causes and effects .
we should be careful not to take a one sided position .
however , it is also showing the will to improve in many areas .
ethnic violence is always evil .
they are not there yet .
few societies as a matter of fact are , but it has been fairly obvious .

it is well known that the afghan army and police force are in a difficult financial situation .
the commission has been attentive .
the eu treaty leaves no room for economic nationalism .
this situation has been exacerbated by the crisis .
there are no figures in sight showing a recovery .
the primary responsibility for managing the crisis obviously lies with the automotive industry itself .
with around eur 40 million , we are helping around 7 000 workers back into the labour market .
this strategy means that it is necessary to take a leap forward in terms of automotive technology .
the european car industry , as we are all aware , suffers from considerable overcapacity .
and those principles will be my guidance in my assessment in the opel case .
i would ask the commission , however , to proceed with the necessary speed .
in 2007 , 58 million cars were sold worldwide , while capacities were 72 million .
opel has had problems .
if you agree we can give the floor to mr méndez de vigo , otherwise you may continue .
i can fully identify with the outlook that commissioner špidla set out for the european car industry .
in this field , the rules on competition are stricter than those on state aid .
in any case , this should emerge clearly from the investigation .
brussels cannot just criticise germany or other governments .
financial protectionism on its own would simply extend the life of uncompetitive activities .
i say this entirely without irony .
it is not yet too late .
it relates to jobs all across europe , and special treatment here for germany would not be right .
i am therefore particularly pleased to see that the commission is willing to examine this case .
we do want to save every job , but at what price ?
it could mark the most expensive election campaign in the history of germany .
i should like to discuss a number of things that have been said in this debate .
he said that a number of methods have been used to set this to rights .
he mentioned the globalisation fund , to which there have been seven applications .
i have complete confidence in commissioner kroes , who is going to examine every aspect of this deal .
my party is in favour of cars , as mr verhofstadt , too , is aware .
i am pleased .
nl madam president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you to the commission for its statement .
the commission is now congratulating itself on the work it has done over recent months .
judged against the potential for environmental improvement , its record has been shameful .
of course , there are positive stories to be told .
i think that the european commission must put a stop to this before it is too late .
es madam president , I thank the commissioners for their explanations .
demand cannot keep up with supply .
where state aid in particular is concerned , I believe that we need to prioritise two areas of action .
that is why you were holding up your blue card , is it not ?
i wonder what kind of industrial policy do we want for europe ?
i am even more worried about state aid , which must not distort competition in the car market .
differing ideas have been put forward about how job losses and notice will be distributed .
furthermore , it is important for the commission and parliament to follow the developments closely .
i therefore think that the car industry has an important role to play in connection with regional development .
the commission should do more , including with regard to awarding grants to the car industry .
i am pleased that the rescue succeeded .
this is not to mention the supply chain , where large numbers of jobs will also be lost .
these are all social tragedies , and I believe that three things are important in this regard .
we need the facts and figures .
we will go as fast as the provision of information allows us .
i am aware that is also what the honourable member wants .
we take the points about speed and being very careful but precise and going into great depth .
that is fundamental and what the commission is absolutely engaged in .
that is one of the main things we owe to the people who are currently living in uncertainty .
however , there are also reservations about handing over more power to the commission in the civil protection sector .
everyone knows how important intervention was both in the case of the tsunami and during hurricane katrina .
this is a systemic disaster of massive proportions and will worsen over the next few decades .
for at least six years , we have been talking about a common european civil protection force .
we need a policy of prevention , but also a policy of coordination .
unfortunately , both the main parties have tried to mitigate and reduce the constitutional protection of forests .
climate change can be used to explain the disasters which have occurred in southern europe to a degree .
does it intend to finance appropriate reforestation , because there is too little reforestation to replace the damage ?
i understand , commissioner , that you are having problems from northern europe as far as subsidiarity is concerned .
for the time being , we have this small unit based in corsica .
let me move on to the commission's observations .
i presented this report on 9 may 200mrs tzavela , obviously , it is not just greece .
then you will see that this affects everyone .
with climate change and global warming , the future does not look any brighter .
even so , we still have fires .
there are several documents that point to solutions .
what is the commission going to do in this regard ?
therefore , having adopted this resolution , this is undoubtedly the challenge for parliament .
the european institutions cannot be incapable once more of finding an adequate solution for those who are affected .
the spanish presidency must also make a clear commitment to developing a common european strategy .
firstly , responsiveness .
we are told that it is the member states that must decide .
let us therefore ensure that the budget our budget genuinely takes account of this problem .
we call on the council to finally release these funds without obstacles .
the regions need the money urgently for reconstruction and for prevention .
europe , too , must do more , however , above all , in terms of better coordination .
i think it is too early to be discussing disaster prevention as a european competence .
why can we not do so in relation to offering protection against fires ?
i can , of course , provide europe with this example , which may be of use .
they can find no direct link to climate change as yet .
with climate change , natural conditions will change that is a fact .
as the commissioner said , coordination is vital .
that causes problems in land development , reforestation and fire prevention policy .
we have here a good resolution .
the exchange of expertise , deployment particularly in the wider region itself , should constitute these foundations .
this is not a matter for centralised control , but must be decentralised to member states .
mr president , I was listening to this debate in my office .
deal with those who deliberately destroy .
emergencies often involve a high human , financial and environmental cost .
one is mobilisation of the community mechanism for civil protection and the other is activation of the solidarity fund .
europe needs to show solidarity in the face of such natural disasters .
in addition , there was a special focus on rules .
we are aware of the sensitivities of the car sector .
tariffs will only be eliminated in year five of the agreement , and that allows time for adjustment .
on duty drawback , my final point , this is nothing new .
such policies are legitimate under the world trade organisation .
and we have negotiated a special clause that would enable us to limit duty drawback efficiently .
that is certainly a novelty something that I think virtually none of us have encountered before .
today , the bulk of these issues have still not been addressed .
i will cite just one example to illustrate our fears .
do you envisage a renegotiation of the controversial points that I have just mentioned ?
or are such bilateral agreements merely a supplement to or expansion of the european union's free trade policy ?
thank you for your answer .
mr president , I must say I am rather concerned about the tone of this debate .
with the exception , perhaps , of daniel caspary's contribution , it has been rather negative .
this is an important agreement , where europe has achieved its strategic objectives .
they concluded that full membership of the eu would cost them up to six times their current bilateral arrangements .
the swiss being the swiss decided that they were better off by not joining or achieving full eu membership .
korea is a serious market .
we are , in fact , an economic superpower .
the question about duty drawback is , for me , a very simple one .
written statements rule 149 
let us leave it to those whose job it is and who do it with professionalism journalists .
developing countries need us now more than ever .
however , developed countries are beginning to come out of the crisis .
nothing justifies a reduction in public development aid .
however , as has already been said , several european countries have announced drastic cuts .
i should like to hear your opinion on a whole series of points .
you also responded in favour of combating tax havens .
to my mind , this is obviously important , as others have said .
looking forward to pittsburgh , that would seem to me to be the big danger .
i also believe we should focus on decreasing dependence on humanitarian aid for some of the beneficiaries .
human lives are not just threatened by floods , but also by the insidious and permanent threat of drought .
i would like to emphasise the regular control of finances both by donors and recipients of funding .
it is their responsibility .
i would even say , to the contrary .
several members have also insisted on the reform of the international financial institutions .
that is my explanation to your question .
the economic situation looked significantly more worrying six months ago , but it seems to have stabilised .
the challenges we face with regard to the climate will require new resources and the redistribution of existing resources .
the logic behind our draft general budget is quite simple .
otherwise , we will not be able to take the gradual steps towards balancing public finances once again .
eight percent !
under sub heading 1b , the council accepted the commitment appropriations proposed by the commission .
the council therefore secured a margin of around eur 310 million in its first reading .
however , there are some particular concerns which I would like to highlight .
it was encouraging that the european commission and council expressed their agreement with it .
researchers born and trained in europe are working outside the european union .
what can we do now ?
i call on my fellow members , the council and commission to support this .
one example of this is the security for the buildings in which we are conducting these debates today .
another example is the court of auditorsreports on translations .
there are many similar examples .
we wanted to adopt a sensible decision on this matter in the first reading .
our financial contribution to the economic recovery will represent scarcely 0.03 % of the union's gdp .
there is no alternative .
your predecessor is , today , the head of state in lithuania .
an important element in dealing with migratory flows is border control .
since its launch in 2005 , frontex's capacity has been progressively expanded .
this dialogue must be based on the principles of solidarity and shared responsibility .
since then , the commission has been working on three major themes .
that is all as regards asylum .
there you have it .
our member states still need to show the full solidarity and the determination necessary to implement this strategy .
allow me to give an example .
therefore , we must keep the complexity of the subject in mind at all times .
i would like to mention some other points .
these are initiatives that need to be put into place instantly .
as a result , we need a common policy , which has still not been developed .
however , it is clear that the response must be coherent with the european identity .
the response must involve legal migration , as an alternative to illegal immigration .
you will recall that many hundreds of migrants perished off the libyan coast .
on 25 august , 57 eritrean migrants were finally rescued after a lengthy spell in maltese waters .
we must act more strongly against the various third countries that irresponsibly encourage those activities .
i therefore call for serious consideration to be given to repealing thisdirective of shame.
britain does not need a common european immigration policy .
what we need to do is end mass immigration now and introduce a strictly limited and controlled immigration policy .
nl mr president , frontex is not working .
it is money down the drain .
the dutch party for freedom , on whose behalf I am speaking , is vehemently opposed to this policy .
let there be an end to it then .
the party for freedom rejects this out of hand .
let there be an end to mass immigration it has gone far enough .
this would be unacceptable , because there are many challenges and missions to be tackled .
it is important that you restated it .
it is important that we uphold these human rights .
frontex therefore needs to be part of a fair and balanced approach to migration and asylum .
this is not true .
such disarray is unacceptable .
why cannot we have some transparency and clarity about frontex and what they are doing ?
we need some obligation here .
pl we want to fight immigration .
migration is , of course , one of the greatest problems facing europe today .
these countries do not only include libya .
can you tell us why you are not introducing compulsory solidarity here too ?
do we really think , mr billström , that all this responsibility can be shouldered by individual states ?
what provisions are you making to ensure real solidarity and real solutions to the suffering of migrants ?
within this cooperation , as the debate has illustrated , libya and turkey have prime position .
the new democracy meps have exercised parliamentary scrutiny .
as for readmission and relocation , we must reinforce frontex still further and organise joint return flights .
the problem is very acute .
for years we have been aware that frontex has violated human rights in individual cases .
the criminal networks that exploit people's desperation must be tackled .
the swedish presidency will organise a special conference in brussels on this issue and the fight against human trafficking .
it requires a package of various initiatives within different areas .
increased cooperation with the countries of origin and transit is particularly important .
the division of responsibility between the countries with regard to sea rescue efforts also needs to be clarified .
i think that this debate has clearly shown that .
applause 
in short , we are ensuring that this duty of protection is upheld .
to conclude , I should like to reiterate that we need a european strategy on migratory movements .
there you have it I am not going to prolong these answers .
i have taken many notes during the various speeches that have been made .
we believe in these values .
i am grateful , in any case , to the european parliament for helping us in this difficult task .
some members have voiced the idea of establishingillegal immigrant quotas.
this is a step forward towards managing all borders .
ec china agreement maritime transport operations accession of bulgaria and romania 
mobilisation of the european union solidarity fund 
i voted in favour of the mobilisation of these funds .
we must stop this development from going any further immediately .
in january 2009 , france was hit by a severe storm .
indeed , it would be unacceptable if only the private sector were to benefit from it .
this report contained provisions related to this situation .

the prospect of the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon will increase this trend spectacularly .
that , in my view , is a modern take on political action .
mr president , I endorse the comments made by mr daul .
this is why I would say that you are right .
our group can fully identify with the programme you announced .
i can only say , mr president , that we face major challenges .
on behalf of my group , I look forward to some exciting and , hopefully , productive debates .
applause 
mr president , your election was an historic moment .
applause 
mr president , I would once again like to congratulate you on your election .
in reality , agreements are made behind closed doors .
the people of europe need a different policy .
we have to suffer the consequences of this .
we currently have many proposals for the additional monitoring of our citizens .
freedom of expression must also apply on the internet .
it is an onerous task , but I am certain that you will make every effort to accomplish it .
i am convinced that the european parliament rests safe in your hands .
that is why I want to reiterate my willingness to work together to advance european parliamentary democracy .
pl mr president , I congratulate you on your election , and on a good speech .
the european parliament has a particular responsibility to show concern for democratic procedures in that country .
the reason for this is that there is no equality of rights .
mr lindblad , the state secretary , mentioned that equality of rights was the budget's fundamental principle .
if this really is the case , why is there no equality of rights with regard to agricultural subsidies ?
mr president , you have encouraged everyone to use their mother tongue .
it is , in fact , a slovak european union dispute as it involves a country flouting fundamental european values .
during the last century , five official languages were learnt in the lower carpathians region .
why am I mentioning this ?
mr president , thank you for your speech .
i believe , however , that our paths diverge considerably .
it remains the wrong path for europe and europe's nations .
they were promised a referendum by the labour government , and the labour government should fulfil that promise .
until now , we have only been equal , but we would like to be more equal .
in other words , you are assuming a mediating role in dealing with national minority matters .
thank you for your attention and I wish you every success .
cs it was john stuart mill who said that parliament should be a mirror of national life .
if we cannot achieve this in europe , then who can ?
we should explain with greater conviction that we can work on resolving our problems with confidence .
hu hungary commemorated the 1956 revolution and fight for freedom on 23 october 200absolute terror reigned in the country .
many hundreds of people were put in prison and had sham criminal proceedings brought against them .
this ended only recently with them all being released , virtually without exception .
i am thinking of the gas pipeline , because you spoke about energy policy .
there is also the question of enlargement of the european union what about ukraine ?
i do not forget where I have come from , but time is moving on so quickly .
mr schulz stressed that it is a two and a half year programme .
the voice of the citizens has enormous significance here .
why ? because we need greater contact with the citizens .
this is really what it was about .
mrs harms and I have the same opinion on the issue of our climate .
we were both in bali , we were both in poznań , and we will both be in copenhagen .
mr kamiński stressed that we have different views on the future of europe .
mr speroni spoke about appropriate and worthy cooperation with the european commission and the european council .
please remember that parliament is growing in significance .
the treaty of lisbon guarantees us considerably more powers than we have at present .
let us endeavour to make the impossible become possible .
there is also a very important programme the stockholm programme .
let us remember this .
our neighbours are found around the mediterranean sea and in eastern europe .
however , let us not contend with one another in this way .
it is very important that we maintain a balance .
mrs lichtenberger spoke of the role of parliament when we make law .
mr balczó asks if a unified europe really does exist to the extent that I said in my speech .
we will endeavour to achieve this .
i wanted to stress this very strongly .
mr tannock mentioned a human rights commissioner .
you spoke very wisely .
i agree .
i am counting on this completely , and I understand that all of us areenergetic.
mr ransdorf does really represent the citizens and the life of the nation .
i agree , and this is why the responsibility and the powers of the european parliament are growing .
yes , over here it was attractive , but over there we were striving for freedom .
i can also meet with you to discuss this so that I have an understanding of this matter .
mr tőkés spoke about 1956 and hungary .
we all care very much about those events , and about our profound faith in the eu .
yes , I , too , believe deeply in the strength of the european union .
they remain in force nothing has changed here .
this is why I propose most definitely a common energy policy .
furthermore , we are going to meet regularly .
written statements rule 149 
i congratulate you on your election to the position of president of the european parliament .
this is an important moment in the history of european integration .
i believe that this will indeed happen .
this vision of the future of europe is attractive to very many europeans .
thank you very much .
applause 
this includes , in particular , minorities , gays , roma and jews .
there were indeed problems .
this party received 430 000 votes in hungary .
you are therefore calling 430 000 voters fascist .

the next item is the statement by the president designate of the commission .
we have experience .
now is not the time for the status quo , or routine .
in the interests of transparency , I would like to highlight those areas with all of you now .
we must reinvigorate our inclusive social market economy .
but we cannot return to the previous growth model .
yes , we need to map out a genuine european agenda .
we cannot allow a return tobusiness as usual.
in the guidelines , I emphasise the importance of services of general interest for our european model of society .
this also includes the question of own resources .
this will reflect the central priority I attach to research and innovation .
what I propose is no less than a transformational agenda for europe .
we are indeed living in very exceptional times , times of uncertainty and power shifts .
there is a real danger that our achievements in european integration are called into question .
it is this pioneering europe that will be the role model at the copenhagen conference .
obviously , the president of the commission could not represent a single party .
obviously , he must compromise with a college of commissioners belonging to several political families .
applause 
we could have started with a different majority .
however , you have hardly started to concentrate on one programme before you begin doing something different .
it is about the direction of europe as a whole and that is not your decision alone .
therefore , for us it is also a question of programme related issues .
you have said that you will put them in place .
there is a way to get there .
this is intended to enliven our debates .
heckling 
he has been here for a while ?
it is not very responsible .
wait two weeks , three weeks , two months , until they come with proposals ?
our support is very clear .
you are going to get a roasting !
josé manuel obama yes , he can !
the banks why did they go crazy ?
because we have a system that makes them completely crazy .
why ?
for the simple reason that it is about having more and more , and still more , more quickly .
there needs to be a measure , and here I am hallucinating even more .
you talked about the lisbon process .
you talked about research .
then , with the crises , you suddenly realised that it did not work like that .
is mr barnier going to get the internal market ?
what is he going to give to the germans ?
what is he going to give to the british ?
there are , unfortunately , many questions on which we do not agree .
the political system must take responsibility , learn from its mistakes and give up its neo liberal ideals .
i would like to illustrate our political disagreement using some examples .
you want to adhere to the lisbon strategy .
we expect the new commission to restructure the posting of workers directive .
europe must finally give a guarantee that social rights will not be sacrificed to the competitive approach .
i think that you could , for example , by means of the employment policy guidelines .
we are calling for a ban on particularly risky forms of investment and a tax on capital movements .
you , and I quote ,support every paragraph of the treaty of lisbon.
you have been in charge of overseeing that the constitutional treaty was pushed through .
but things went wrong , did they not ?
you have overseen the lisbon agenda it was sunk without trace way before the credit crunch hit us .
hu mr president , europe has reached an historic turning point .
they want to combat the gross injustices of neoliberalism and global big capital .
to be able to do this , they are in huge need of human rights .
the discussion and speeches here are undeniably more dynamic and entertaining than back home in sweden .
there are just two things I would like to say .
he has our clear support to lead the commission for another term .
my second comment is also self evident , but it bears repeating .
we are living in extremely uncertain times with considerable and difficult challenges .
the commission does not and has never advocated the privatisation of public services .
this is very important .
everyone should assume their responsibilities .
without that freedom of circulation , we are not going to have a europe .
fr and , mr cohn bendit , I wish to tell you something .
i do not have an obsession with you .
applause 
this is important .
a party put forward a candidate before the elections .
it is up to you to vote for me .
this may not be the best news for everyone , but I believe in it .
i am proposing to you now a new ambition for europe .
this is the first time that we have had this enlarged europe .
i make no apology for having loyally worked alongside these heads of state or government .
maybe we should change this in future , but for now we must observe the rules .
i would like to add no strong european commission .
the commission president has a great deal of the primary responsibility .
that is the next chapter in our book .
what about protecting the climate ?
telling us that you do not exclude the possibility of one is simply not enough this time .
thirdly , your transformational agenda is the agenda of the past .
we cannot start work on this next year we must begin immediately .
we expect that a common strategy will be developed jointly with the member states .
we want him to have genuine authority .
i read president barroso's political guidelines with great interest .
it was time to discuss issues and you had some tough questions , from me among others .
the president cut off the speaker 
unfortunately , president barroso , in a democracy you cannot please everyone .
some people do not like you because you are too european , and others because of ideological prejudice .
others want to postpone the decision .
good luck , president barroso , and success in your work .
in the next few weeks , you will have the time to prove that you really take this seriously .
these members will support you tomorrow .
we believe that the commission is rather less strong today than it was five years ago .
we need properly coordinated economic and fiscal policies in europe .
this allowed the european union financial sector to invest most profitably in those countries .
a speedier introduction of the euro in these countries would reduce these costs and create stability .
what kind of rights are these , when they are rejected out of hand in the name of solidarity ?
ukip places sovereignty and the citizen's rights above solidarity .
they would probably have listened to you today and seen that you promised everything to everyone .
hopefully , they would also find out what you did five years ago .
that was when you promised most people a very great deal .
i believe that is very , very little .
i want to make that quite clear .
fourthly and finally , we want a fundamentally new version of the interinstitutional agreements .
under these conditions , the five year period of office will be a positive one .
the president cut off the speaker 
it applies only to questions to the previous speaker , not for statements .
apologies for cutting you off .
you must be aware that the problems you raised do not arise in all member states .
i remember the first delors commission had no women and the second had only one .
i am committed to social cohesion .
there is a contradiction there , so let us be honest about it .
of course it is a compromise , but europe only works as a compromise .
europe cannot work on fanaticism , or on dogmatism .
i thank the epp for the support it has given me .
are you ?
the president cut off the speaker 
between 2002 and 2006 , 728 people were transferred to guantánamo via portuguese airspace .
we grew up in peace .
unfortunately , europe does not have a culture of achievement .
remain open minded and do not propose a european tax because it will provoke a pitchfork revolution against europe .
i have never seen a demonstration in favour of a european tax .
when it comes down to it , we all have very little influence .
why do you not use plain language ?
sv mr president , europe today is a continent defined by peace and democracy .
this was not the case 20 years ago , either , when europe was divided into east and west .
our generation has a responsibility to manage our continent and preserve and strengthen an open and democratic europe .
here are some guiding principles for the continuation of your work .
you need to do more in this regard .
the eu does not need more institutional power struggles .
preserve us from that fate !
i hope that you will then ensure that there are as many women as men in the new commission .
this concept appears to harbour serious dangers in terms of worker protection .
part time employment , for example , is fine when it is the worker's choice .
in the past , far right extremists concealed their faces under various different masks and guises .
are you that leader , mr barroso ?
however , you have taken a great interest in my constituency of northern ireland .
for this commitment I thank you .
we value the support and close working relationship of commission officials at all levels with northern ireland .
you will know about the huge potential for the economy through the development of tourism .
as many in this chamber have said already today , it is actions and delivery that count .
es madam president , commission president , I want to make a preliminary comment .
we are not only experiencing an economic and financial crisis , but also a crisis of values .
the second point , which I also support , is mr barroso's european ambition .
this is why we hope that the treaty of lisbon will be ratified .
it is a tool box that will make the institutions work .
we need a strong commission that can confront the crisis as quickly as possible .
the third reason is a contract of confidence that we have signed with you .
in this respect , an important role will be played by the agency for the cooperation of energy regulators .
energy security also depends on the eu's neighbours .
for this we need an industrial policy to be adopted .
the citizens need to be set an example of solidarity in order to combat the crisis .
to carry on as before is disastrous , said the philosopher , walter benjamin .
finally , over the last six weeks , you have struck me as a man with passion and enthusiasm .
institutionally speaking , we are on the way from nice to lisbon .
whether these are dangers or opportunities depends to a great extent on ourselves .
that is my hope .
in this area , we are faced with several new challenges .
mt madam president , mr barroso , financial and economic challenges have been extensively discussed .
we had the tampere programme , the hague programme , and now that of stockholm .
i believe that we must invest renewed energy in this field .
are you satisfied with your achievements over the past five years ?
what do you think you need to change about the way in which you go about your work ?
you clearly want to lead the commission of a european union that numbers 500 million people .
what additional efforts will your commission make in order to speed up this process ?
we are confident not only in you , but also in this parliament .
madam president , this vote tomorrow is very much a vote about the standing of the european parliament .
good luck tomorrow .
applause 
the geopolitical framework has undergone radical change .
the committee on petitions is the first point of contact between the european institutions and citizens .
however , I question the european union's financial standing as regards all of your projects .
some of my fellow members have already stressed this point .
it is true that the crisis is putting the member statesbudgets under pressure at the moment .
i would like to thank the european commission for working with us .
firstly , that of presenting competition as an absolute and insurmountable dogma .
pl madam president , europe is united .
however , europe is also diversified .
the common agricultural policy actually sanctions two europes the old and the new .
this requires changes and the creation of a genuine , unified , united and cohesive europe .
it is easy to criticise but we have to give credit where credit is due .
i am greatly in favour of your further term and I will vote for it .
i have one specific comment we know mr barroso's position on the modified policies .
madam president , I would first of all like to wish mr barroso well for tomorrow in the vote .
i know it is difficult to try and pinpoint any one individual state .
in this respect , I call for this temporary support to become permanent support .
those opposing the treaty in ireland are spreading scurrilous information about the minimum wage to be eur 1.8people speak of green shoots as part of the economic recovery in europe .
the investment community and people who create jobs want the lisbon treaty enacted .
these guarantees are important to us .
de madam president , the european union is suffering from a dramatic democratic deficit .
these warnings were definitely made .
hu thank you for this opportunity to speak .
i would like to ask president barroso two questions .
it is as simple as that .
many questions focused on energy security those of mr saryusz wolski , mr marinescu and others .
what are the chinese doing ?
of course , we have problems in europe , consistency problems .
you all know where this crisis came from .
immediately after , we reacted .
it was europe that instigated this response .
therefore I do not need anyone's advice on how to show commitment to fundamental rights .
thank you , anyway .
that is obvious .
mrs int veld told me that I had not convinced her .
you are very difficult to convince , mrs int veld .
i believe that it would be a mistake to start by talking about the amounts for the future budget .
we are world leaders when it comes to financial services .
what is the point of handing over the leadership to dubai ?
i do not see what the point would be .
europe is very diverse .
i can assure you of that .
some of them are still here .
i am grateful to you .
i think highly of parliament .
some say you are too close to the governments.
i am a politician I am not a technocrat or a bureaucrat .
applause 
he has given us information which is very important , both for us and for our citizens .
that , however , is not and never has been the only possible direction .
part one
the textile and clothing sector comes from decades of managed trade .
today european textiles are known in the world for their innovation and technical performance .
i therefore ask you what specifically is going to be done .
that is precisely what we are seeking to do .
subject eu priorities for intergovernmental conference on climate change
the eu has offered to take up a 30 % reduction target if others make comparable commitments .
these plans would then form the basis for targeted financial and other support .
adequate international financing will be essential to reach an effective agreement in copenhagen .
perhaps you could tell us more about this .
would it be possible to increase the aid for developing countries ?
concrete actions and procedures have already been put in place to speed up delivery of aid .
the prime responsibility for delivering on the oda commitments lies with the member states themselves .
pl thank you for your explanation .
subject demographics and development policy in africa
in particular , the education of women has an impact on their reproductive behaviour .
however , in developing countries this demographic increase is particularly large , with social and economic consequences too .
the problem of overpopulation in africa is clearly limited to individual countries .
to what extent are these facts influencing the development policy of the european union ?
this is not a new phenomenon .
we have seen it in all countries all over the globe .
it is rather a phenomenon that is linked to the development of the country concerned .
serious concerns remain concerning the effective application of the ilo core conventions in the country .
twenty seven trade unionists have been murdered since the beginning of january 200i am very pleased that mr higgins has asked his question .
subject international trade recovery
can the commission provide the following information 
subject marketing european beef and lamb products
can I ask the commissioner if she would consider a thorough and full examination of the food promotion budget ?
it is well known that european beef and lamb products comply with the highest standards .
indeed , it is an area where we have increasingly to look and focus .
consequently , there is also money from this source .

g20 summit in pittsburgh 24 25 september debate 
we will hold an informal european council in brussels tomorrow to prepare the eu's common position .
firstly , rapid and forceful financial and monetary policy measures to support the financial sector and the real economy .
the g20 process has had the following significant results 
that is why the presidency is inviting the heads of state or government to a dinner tomorrow evening .
we have only just begun to reflect on these exit strategies .
the european union has played an active and decisive role in encouraging the g20 in this respect .
this is an aspiration that the european union supports , but it must be translated into concrete agreements .
it is a summit where decisions have to be taken .
commissioner almunia , you said that there are proposals in place for hedge funds .
that is the most important message this parliament can give the pittsburgh delegates .
it is good to start with the bonus systems , but it is not enough .
nor should you be frightened of discussing fiscal policy it is not prohibited .
we want a number of the g20's elements and commitments to be formalised .
please help us to take advantage of this experience .
we cannot get out of this on our own .
europe must hammer home this message tirelessly .
secondly , we must successfully put in place effective supervision and a much more demanding form of bank stabilisation .
i have several concerns .
the first is that the committee on development in this house drafted a motion for a resolution .
a global financial system needs transparency .
they should do anything that can be seen if they want people to believe in them .
the reality is that high finance gives the orders and politics obeys them .
my second observation is that we must not fall for gimmicks .
the fire appears to have been put out , but the foundations of our financial system are still shaky .
i am expecting specific and fast measures from the gi hope that the eu member states will all pull together .
mr president , so far the g20 has concentrated on measures for the financial sector .
i have deep respect for small enterprises which , against all odds , try to survive .
that will be one of the controversial questions at the g20 summit .
we must also take employment into consideration .
these are the people's real needs .
the crisis is not over .
furthermore , commissioner , minister , please do not forget in pittsburgh that europe exists .
i have here the letter of 3 september from the three european prime ministers .
for this we need a consistent approach .
firstly , we need more europe .
if we fail to achieve this , europe will not count and will not be involved .
secondly , we need more state .
fr mr president , you spoke of the governance of the imf .
what is the council's position ?
our economies are still very fragile .
i firmly believe that we must take action against such trends .
they are completely at the mercy of the banks , which do not provide sufficient reliable information .
do you not think we should tackle this issue ?
many members have raised the issues that both I and the commissioner have looked at .
yes , we need better supervision and better regulation of the financial markets .
we hope that a supervisory system can be put in place as soon as possible .
we will base this on the larosière report and see how quickly we can get it into place .
we need more coordinated global solutions and effective and functioning international institutions .
we would also like to take up the matter of climate financing .
we will be having a special discussion on unemployment at ecofin in october .
many members have raised the matter of hedge funds and new financial regulation .
these are priority issues for the swedish presidency .
in summary , naturally the g20 summit cannot solve all the problems that we have discussed .
thank you very much for a highly interesting debate .
however , without a functioning financial system , nothing else can be sustained .
the debate is closed .
it is expected that the approaching g20 summit will place a predominant emphasis on the copenhagen climate talks .
number three . flexibility mechanisms must continue to be given an important role .
at present , four of them have already achieved this .
mr president , the market economy is a good slave but a bad master .
i think , however , that we should at least look into how relevant they might be .
there have already been steps taken in this direction .
in writing . I agree with those who spoke about the need for a global co ordinated approach .
this week marks the anniversary of the collapse of lehman brothers .
transparency is essential if we are to bring consumer confidence back to the banking sector .
this is indeed what will happen .
allow me to mention certain other provisions that we will demand are included in the agreement .
firstly , there must be a balance between civil security and civil rights .
but there are some key questions left open .
to which judge can an eu citizen or an eu enterprise go in the case of criminal prosecution ?
mr president , after all these warm words , I am going to put a cat among the pigeons !
for me , that is a little bit back to front .
it was known back in 2007 that the architecture of swift needed to be reformed .
in fact , however , fundamental rights are being eroded and proper public debate on them frustrated .
it is not enough to just tap at the door a responsible parliament must stop this undesirable development .
we greens will have nothing to do with this .
i will try to answer some of the questions in the short time available .
in order for this to happen , we need an agreement .
that is what I have attempted to describe .
mr president , I have a small point of order .
the debate is closed .
eu strategy for the baltic sea area debate 
this is a very sensitive marine environment that is exposed to various kinds of environmental impact .
decisive efforts are needed , and quickly .
the economic crisis has made the matter of jobs and growth highly topical .
our aims and goals in this respect are clear .
we must address the crisis by increasing cooperation and commitment in our immediate area .
global competitiveness requires cross border cooperation between countries and enterprises , in research and through innovations .
the aim of the strategy for the baltic sea area is not to create new institutions .
i would also like to express my special gratitude to commission president barroso .
the eu and member states have to agree on providing alternative channels for energy deliveries .
europe has already invested eur 200 million in the safety of this power plant .
i do not think so .
following this sacrifice , lithuania will find it considerably harder to overcome the economic crisis .
unemployment in the country will grow even more and poverty will increase .
this is an area with 100 million inhabitants and an investment budget of eur 50 billion .
here I would like to underline the role the then commissioner mrs danuta hübner played in drafting this strategy .
this policy is now being continued by commissioner samecki , to whom I also extend my heartfelt congratulations .
let us hope that this one works well .
the baltic sea is suffering two major acute environmental problems .
the problem is that the baltic sea needs a healthy ecosystem .
at present large volumes of young cod that have just arrived in the baltic sea are being dumped .
i call on the swedish presidency to take up my challenge and deal with this problem .
our second priority is further infrastructure development .
however , not all the recommendations of this house have been accepted by the commission .
the commission assures us that funding will come from existing instruments , primarily the structural funds .
the authors of the strategy mention the need for close cooperation with russia .
fi mr president , the european union became aware of the baltic sea issue quite late on .
during its presidency , sweden has also integrated these regional policy matters closely with this baltic sea strategy .
some of the region's member states , including latvia , have been severely hit by the economic crisis .
our financial sector is interconnected with the scandinavian one .
this means that our problems will create problems there , so this is not a national issue .
without proper financing , however , the project will not succeed .
the president cut off the speaker 
eur 55 million has been earmarked for the region under the existing budgetary framework .
mrs hassi and mrs lövin mentioned the matter of the marine environment , agriculture and fisheries .
naturally it is related to the baltic sea , but it is not part of the strategy .
however , it is to be agreed in the future work related to the implementation of the strategy .
second point on management and governance .
i think that we should not delude ourselves .
the responsibilities of member states , of the commission and of other organisations involved in the management .
written statements rule 149 
in writing . the baltic sea strategy promoted by the swedish presidency is very welcome .
there is , however , one aspect of the development of the baltic sea region that demands urgent reconsideration .
it is not such a bad idea , is it , ladies and gentlemen ?
today's agenda includes electing the president of the european commission .
as usual , in the vote you may vote for or against the candidate , or abstain .
the vote is held 
mr president , I know that you are aware of the priorities of the european parliament .
congratulations , and all the best !
applause 
this was the official statement related to the election of mr barroso as president of the european commission .
forest fires in the summer of 2009 vote 
in 2008 , we waited in vain for president barroso to call for order .
it is difficult for those who have the floor to speak with this din all around .
many people believe that smart regulation is bad regulation , or that any regulation is not very smart regulation .
the european commission's policy needs to be reoriented .
mr barroso is not the man for the job .
this value has been acknowledged by the european parliament in this vote .
the text you sent us does not make this clear .
i voted in favour of appointing mr barroso as president of the european commission .
in my understanding of democracy , election winners can claim the right to choose one of their own .
there is no other choice but mr barroso no alternative solution has been seriously considered .
the europe of the 12 , of kohl and mitterrand , is no more and will doubtless never return .
i hope it will be so and I want to give him the credit for this .
to postpone this vote one more time would be to bark up the wrong tree .
the european union should repay this friendship and thus support the future of rural areas .
it does not , however , explain environmental disasters , especially if the same phenomena recur every few years .
we must say straightaway that preventing natural disasters and adapting to climate change is not an easy task .
for me , two proposals seem essential to improve the situation .
i voted in favour of the resolution on forest fires .
in april 2009 , the number of fires was the highest in five years .
we need to set up a european reaction force capable of acting quickly in case of natural disasters .
the devastation to many sites of natural beauty is a loss to us all .
cecilia malmström , the minister for european affairs , will sign on behalf of the council .
i am very pleased that commissioner benita ferrero waldner is also with us today .
these acts are aimed at stabilising the financial markets .
you will all be present at the signing , and the minister and I will sign .
we shall now proceed to the signing .
composition of interparliamentary delegations see minutes
12475 / 2004 11803 / 2004 c6 0118 / 2005 .
the second round of this dialogue will take place in dushanbe on 23 september .
we must continue to encourage tajikistan to introduce a programme of reforms .
it is hindering not only development in tajikistan , but also effective contributions from donors .
we welcome tajikistan's interest in cooperation and support its efforts .
that is positive .
it is a territory vulnerable to spill over from these conflict areas and to infiltration by islamic militants .
a key element in tajikistan's vulnerabilities is its weak economy .
i believe that we are now on the right track with tajikistan , supporting and encouraging indispensable reforms .
above all , I would like to thank the embassy of the republic of tajikistan for their cooperation .
tajikistan has come in for a lot of criticism for its lack of democracy .
in addition , it is a relatively stable country , which is important , considering its strategic location .
i am pleased in this respect that the report also mentions the millennium development goals .
the european union is tajikistan's primary trading partner .
merely criticising what is wrong in tajikistan will not achieve this .
it was also excellent to hear that an ombudsman's institution had been established in tajikistan .
central asia is a region vital to the eu's political and energy security .
the problem has already been addressed here in general terms .
madam president , quite honestly , this debate gives me mixed feelings .
i have just heard it again in a debate and I absolutely cannot understand where this idea comes from .
what I read in paragraph 2 about the disappointment of the tajik government I find entirely astonishing .
i hope , commissioner , that this is also followed up on conscientiously .
madam president , I am very much in favour of this agreement .
tajikistan is at the crossroads of drug trafficking from afghanistan to europe and russia .
mr peterle deals with all this very systematically in his report .
i am pleased that the european parliament is still holding the banner high as regards human rights .
mrs hautala brought up the matter of water .
this is a very important issue .
i am sure that the commission will return to this later .
as mr tannock rightly said , we should not marginalise tajikistan .
on the contrary , I think we should engage with this poorest country of central asia .
so we know that this is an extremely important issue .
for that , we have introduced bomka , the border management programme .
that is excellent because it works against smuggling .
i have visited those institutions myself and I can tell you they are working very well .
let me say a second word on the human rights question .
water has also been mentioned .
not least , visa liberalisation will create new opportunities for trade , industry and transfer of know how .
where kosovo is concerned , the commission's proposal involves no change .
the commission proposal has been submitted to the council .
as for montenegro , a lasting solution must be found for displaced persons .
we all stand for this .
however , the citizens in the european union equally expect security .
we should not give these states a free rein .
the rules of play are clear and anyone who abides by them has every chance of having visas waived .
it is not as if there are no anomalies at present .
the process would be exactly the same , though a bit later .
i cannot believe the commission and the council intend to pursue this damaging path .
they are already issuing biometric passports and have made about the same amount of progress on the other criteria .
in this regard , we need to consistently hold up definite european prospects before them .
however , the wounds are far from healed and every measure by the eu is being evaluated accordingly .
visa liberalisation in the western balkans is not a jigsaw puzzle with which you might wish to amuse yourselves .
that would be good for all the three countries and for the western balkans as a whole .
the bosniaks are the only people in bosnia who have not been allowed to travel freely throughout europe .
bosnia is close to having its visa requirements lifted .
however , the path on which you have embarked has a number of stumbling blocks .
it will result , above all , in the muslim citizens of bosnia feeling discriminated against .
i think that the wrong wording was chosen in june .
today as we have heard there are still problems in serbia and in montenegro .
technical assistance means a great deal .
i would ask the commission and the council to help these countries .
they have a new government they will manage , but kosovo will only manage if you all help .
it is a very clear political matter .
i am also delighted with this proposal that has been put forward .
it is very important that the three countries are now given visa free travel .
there were already ethnic tensions before the war , but they have still remained following the war .
i am from a generation which grew up with hundreds of thousands of so called yugoslavian foreign workers .
disintegration for kosovo or bosnia would endanger our security more than any technical details .
consequently , I welcome the proposal on visa liberalisation for serbia , macedonia and montenegro .
the conditions must be met .
let us not make this more of a political issue than is necessary , however .
i believe that freedom of movement is the gateway to democracy and knowledge .
in your decision , you will certainly draw up a recommendation for speeding up this process .
the timescales must correspond to these checks , which should be speeded up if possible .
how can it be possible , then , that the proposals threaten to isolate the bosnian muslims ?
great inequality is arising within a single country , as serbian and croatian bosnians do receive a passport .
who will stand up for the bosnian muslims ?
will the council ?
i call on the commission to include bosnia and herzegovina within the visa free zone as soon as possible .
however , we are holding back hundreds of thousands of those who have good intentions .
that applies whether we are talking about visas or accession .
they have not been forgotten , however .
we must give a clear political signal that the opportunity is there for them to be included .
madam president , I would firstly like to mention that this is a groundbreaking step .
we must be particularly mindful of this .
there is , therefore , a process in motion which does not aim to discriminate against anyone .
we simply want the road map's objective criteria to be observed increasingly .
that is what we want .
there is no question of discriminating against the 25 or 30 % of muslim albanians in macedonia .
macedonia , serbia and montenegro have definitely taken the turning for the european union .
their governments have demonstrated that they share the same values as we do .
the balkan countries are an integral part of europe .
this process must be resolutely continued .
it is about european values .
it will expose young and vulnerable gay , lesbian and transgender people to bullying and exclusion .
we are all europeans .
according to this law , factual information on this is supposedly damaging to these young people .
i am delighted that a proposal is on the table today , including a motion for a resolution .
we know how those things begin , and we also know where they always lead .
appoint a committee to see what is and what is not promotion of homosexuality ?
the british conservatives introduced in great britain a similar law in 198it will affect the very way young people and others speak , think and act .
and why ?
so I say to lithuanians and people across europe reject this dangerous step back to the past .
applause 
our union is based on various principles and values that all the member states are expected to support .
the presidency has made this position clear in contacts with the lithuanian government on repeated occasions .
it is up to the commission to judge whether a member state is meeting its obligations under the treaties .
since the law has not yet entered into force , no such proposal has been tabled .
madam president , the minister has explained very well the legal elements of this problem .
these are binding principles of community law .
these amendments should be proposed at the end of october .
the president of the republic of lithuania took the initiative by tabling clarifying amendments immediately .
the possibility of direct promotion to minors has been dealt with by the adoption of a law .
ok , that is the case for you .
madam president , mr landsbergis has given a deeply unconvincing justification of this law .
the council and the commission have expressed their deep concern , and that is the correct line .
anti discrimination and freedom of expression are absolutely fundamental principles in european law .
this is to say that I strongly support the resolution .
this means that this is not an internal issue of lithuanian policy .
another concern of the lithuanian legislators was that children should be brought up according to their parentsconvictions .
we are talking about the eu and the eu's respect for fundamental human rights .
in practice , this proposed legislation risks making any information about lgbt issues illegal .
i hope that parliament will be as unified as possible in voting in favour of this resolution tomorrow .
we have worked for this for many years .
we have the agency for fundamental rights .
it does have a purpose .
i thank all of my fellow members who have put so much into these negotiations .
the voice of non governmental organisations also fell on deaf ears .
at the moment , a similar draft directive is being debated in the council of ministers .
the law in question does not contravene any international standards in the area of human rights .
sv madam president , all people are born equal and have the same inviolable value .
let the members of this house remind each other that the greatest of all is love .
this house is ignoring the legitimacy of a national parliament which has twice voted through the law without criticism .
i have a question what must the irish be thinking ahead of the forthcoming referendum ?
madam president , I fully agree with the minister's conclusions .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday 17 september 200written statements rule 149 
discrimination is prohibited under european and international law .
in 1990 , the world health organisation removed homosexuality from the international statistical classification of diseases and health problems .
it also confirmed that no type of sexual orientation is a disorder .
in any societies , including lithuanian society , there are lesbians , gays and bisexual .
question time council 
the next item is question time b7 0203 / 2009 .
the following questions are addressed to the council .
the council shares the member of parliament's concern regarding animal welfare .
i know that we in ireland have certainly bought into it .
this is what I can say at the moment .
so I think we need to be sensitive to this issue .
as soon as it comes , we will throw ourselves at it and start to discuss it .
i know that this issue is hugely important .
why is that ?
are you going to raise it on another occasion ?
it is very unfortunate that the conference in brussels clashes with the session .
that is why they coincide .
thank you very much for that reply .
i am sad as well that the conference is being held when we are in strasbourg .
one of the most important items on its agenda is reform of the fao .
this was welcomed by the european council in june 200i do appreciate the detailed response .
there are positive reports coming from almost all the different markets .
it touches upon the conference itself but it is , of course , something that goes much further .
subject stability and development pact
thank you very much for your very concise response .
therefore , the proposal to eliminate that has no support from the council .
so the social fund is only one instrument to combat unemployment .
de thank you , mrs malmström .
we intend to have an urgency debate on this matter tomorrow .
madam president , the council is aware of the events brought up by the member of parliament .
the council has worked continually and very actively on her behalf .
furthermore , during this time , the council has taken specific action a number of times .
i would like to thank you , madam president in office , for your comprehensive reply .
the us has a key role to play here .
naturally , we will be discussing these issues at the g20 summit next week .
there is strong interest on both sides in strengthening transatlantic political dialogue and cooperation on development work .
we are firmly convinced that the summit will promote transatlantic relations in a positive and constructive manner .
thank you very much minister .
president in office of the council . this morning we had a debate on the preparations for gthe eu stands united .
we know what we want .
on non proliferation , we are very happy that this is again on the agenda .
we are very process oriented .
questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing see annex .
opening of the sitting
the sitting was opened at 09.00 
the prices paid to milk producers have plummeted everywhere , averaging 24 cents per litre within the european union .
the top line is good news prices are improving .
if I could start with the report , I will look first at state aid .
the second point is streamlining the procedures for responding to prices in the dairy sector .
the dairy sector is in trouble .
the commission really should have acted more swiftly in this regard .
it would also make sense to introduce an early retirement regulation .
that is why we have tabled amendments to this effect and why I welcome your reassurance on this matter .
consumers are losing out as they fail to get the benefits from the fall in milk prices .
farmers are losing out because they do not receive a fair share of the retail milk price .
the european union had counted on growth in world demand .
its experts got it very wrong .
the financial and economic crisis that we are experiencing has direct effects on agriculture and consumption .
on each litre of milk , some small farmers are losing up to 30 cents .
it has terrible consequences in terms of employment and land use patterns .
they sat on their hands for too long , and many farmers have suffered grievously for that .
i think we need to do more in the short term to help the industry through this present crisis .
instead , she wants to continue deregulating the sector against the farmersbest interests .
i consider it necessary .
madam president , I would like to thank the commissioner for her words to us today .
when the dairy sector struggles , the rest of the rural economy struggles .
currently dairy farmers receive just over 20 cents per litre for milk amid escalating costs .
madam president , when farm women start protesting you know there is a serious difficulty .
i want to say that , in relation to the future , your comments are particularly welcome .
we must endorse them and even call for them to be enlarged in scope .
in order to regulate a market , we need public regulation .
financial assistance is required by dairy farmers immediately .
the current situation is unsustainable and requires a political solution .
the opportunity to produce milk should go mainly to producers who have low costs and who achieve a profit .
the margin that the farmer receives is so unfair .
the supermarkets need to reduce their profit margins .
quotas have increased , while production has fallen .
i believe that setting fixed quotas would lead to a rise in prices over time .
because dairy production does not have a tap that we can just turn off and on .
because dairy production does not have a tap that we can just turn off and on willy nilly .
we are hearing over and over again that the adopted milk quota regulations should be amended .
as a dairy farmer myself , I can only warn you against doing this .
i therefore call on the commission to explain how it is going to deal with this problem .
firstly , in my view , the implementation of the super levy at this time would be inappropriate .
that is what I term a dysfunctional price chain mechanism .
it is a shame that no one listened to us .
perhaps you should do so now .
commissioner , you should not pass the buck to member states so that they help whoever they can .
the crisis is caused by an over abundant supply of milk , which is making prices drop sharply .
the market is not working .
this situation is plunging them into further difficulties , and they are unable to meet their obligations .
the crisis has not eased .
we are not the mouthpieces for the farmersinterests .
just now , you listed the measures you have taken in the past nine months .
those measures do exist , we will grant you that .
es we cannot allow the milk sector to collapse .
we must prevent these falling into a negative situation .
this must be corrected .
that was a very poor and short sighted decision .
dairy producers do not need your compassion , commissioner .
they do not need the outmoded liberal theories that have drawn us into an unprecedented world crisis .
we are all deeply shaken by what has happened .
this has to change .
i would like to ask the commissioner to take action on this issue .
in the czech republic we now have fewer cattle than we had after the napoleonic wars .
the president cut off the speaker 
hu mr president , emergency measures are obviously needed , as the situation is disastrous .
we are asking for specific advice or a proposal on how .
so these structural changes are taking place anyway .
i am not going to repeat all the different measures that we have been taking .
we are not introducing a new super levy system .
we have already reserved eur 14 million for promotion for the rest of this year .
so I think there are lots of possibilities .
the debate is closed .
in recent weeks we met with the producers , their organisations and the processing industries .
cash flow in the sector is drying up .
in a market thrown off balance by surpluses , any country that increases its production harms all the others .
without this , prices will become unpredictable .
european dairy producers cannot endure the losses caused by large scale price volatility .
but quotas alone will not save the dairy sector .
processing aids
longer private storage scheme for butter
the survival of milk producers is now seriously under threat .
now it is time to roll up our sleeves and come up with new solutions .
we therefore need to adopt urgent measures to prevent this from happening .
the next item is the commission statement on energy security in relation to the nabucco and desertec projects .
secondly , issues related to sustainability .
for this reason , dialogue with the producer , transit and consumer countries is crucial .
we made a major breakthrough this july .
we have identified three sources that are ready to commit gas volumes .
where are the difficulties ?
we have launched a call for proposals .
first of all , there is the technological development that we have supported for many years .
there are two types of interconnection that we need to separate .
we have supported the integration of markets in north africa for some time .
this house has been a very strong supporter of energy efficiency .
it really is the biggest element .
i believe this is a very good combination , as renewable energy also gives security of supply .
so , diversification also covers supply .
the question of security of supply for our citizens is becoming ever more important .
we are dependent on unstable regions and countries with undemocratic regimes .
this also applies to europe in international relations .
nuclear power has a major role to play because it will help combat the greenhouse effect .
firstly , complacency over energy policy is putting us increasingly in the dangerous position of dependency on russia .
why have they not up to now been involved on an equal footing in the planning and decision making processes ?
the president cut off the speaker 
desertec and nabucco are important instruments in this regard .
this is also an important task for us .
that is why it is important to focus our efforts on improving interconnections within the eu .
however , spain cannot help without improving its interconnection capacity through the pyrenees .
this is linked to my call to reinforce the supply from southern europe .
desertec and nabucco are central to meeting these challenges .
we need to develop renewable energy production solar thermal and other .
deserts get more energy from the sun in six hours than humankind uses in a year .
therefore , we are in favour of diversification and also see the nabucco project as a european priority project .
time will tell whether nabucco will play its part in the european union's foreign and security policy .
that is why I am surprised at the european commission's policy towards russia with regard to this matter .
the commission is gravely mistaken in thinking that south stream is not a rival project to nabucco .
amendments to the treaties are a lesser issue .
de mr president , nabucco was giuseppe verdi's first hugely successful opera .
over the next few years , electricity produced from solar energy will become significantly cheaper .
the entire investment could be used to generate a total of 8 000 megawatts of wind energy .
the commission should be in favour of nabucco .
in relation to many of these there is a connected development issue .
this opportunity must not be squandered .
the first is what are we actually talking about when we talk about energy security and energy ?
if it is to send out messages , with what moral authority are we doing so ?
i just feel we have all missed a great opportunity to have a medium and long term policy .
we need to concern ourselves with concrete matters and work on those .
this also relates to the question of the source of supply and transport routes .
what is the use of wonderful plans if there is no one willing to invest in them ?
companies must be encouraged .
we must guard against believing that we can force everything to happen and predetermine every last detail .
it is therefore extremely important for us to take wise decisions in order to safeguard energy supplies .
we just have to look at the map .
here , too , the eu member states are keen to get involved .
next , how can we guarantee energy security ?
mr piebalgs , congratulations on all that you are doing .
we must therefore prepare to import gas .
this is an excellent project for the euro mediterranean area .
much depends on relations with turkey .
i am pleased that this is exactly what the commissioner underlined today .
we have to achieve a united european energy policy that would coordinate our activity across all energy issues .
thank you for your attention .
we will have to raise an estimated figure of some eur 8 billion for the 3 300 kilometre pipeline .
the original promise was for some eur 30 million .
we need to realise that we have to go further .
the eu must invest more in the diversification of energy supply sources .
there is also a clear strategy in russia to secure its dominance in europe over the gas sector .
we must ensure that the work on the medgaz pipeline is quickly completed .
this situation cannot continue , because if it does it will permanently jeopardise the european union's energy security .
turkey must nail its colours to the mast and put its weight fully behind the nabucco project .
we can only hope that russia will respect the charter and will not take any definitive action .
european gas consumers cannot be left at the mercy of monopolies .
what supporting measures can the european commission take with regard to this ?
we need better gas storage capacity in europe and more integration of our pipeline and electricity grids .
this means that demand will not be met , even with all the projects currently in hand .
but of course there is no one answer to ensuring our supply .
energy efficiency must also be improved .
it is not a quick fix .
i would like to say something more about this .
however , regulations on transparency can be easily circumvented .
this is why we are asking the european commission to abandon its convenient position of idle introspection .
let us not make ourselves vulnerable precisely on this issue .
we all agree on that .
in 2009 , he presented an interesting report , which contained equally interesting conclusions .
so I believe that is the right support to give .
for this reason the second strategic energy review is still very important .
all the points that we put forward in the second energy review are still there .
regarding the point on nuclear energy , we have moved away from this option .
but I doubt that we could go further than that .
there are many instruments , and we will come back to this debate in the future .
thank you very much for this debate .
in writing . bg unfortunately the eu still does not have an effective energy security policy .
developing common rules for the supply and transit of gas 
they have also demonstrated the added value nabucco offers in this respect for the entire european union .
there is only one small problem it is not ours .
it is russia's .
before that , we had the russians taking over the hungarian company mol's interest in nabucco .

explanations of vote
oral explanations of vote
i therefore consider this resolution to be an ideological disgrace .
issues like this , the protection of minors , are for many of our constituents sensitive and ethical issues .
it should be made clear that we cannot overcome this crisis with the measures proposed by the commission alone .
it is a sad fact that the situation in the dairy sector is extremely critical .
a few multinational companies would then dominate the european market .
we in padania drink in memory of the sacrifice made by our producers , which this europe must protect .
this is a disgrace !
we finally must guarantee food sovereignty instead of using the free trade model dictated by the wto .
we were just beginning to get away , and now this house has voted to bring it all back .
this week we are debating the milk quota system in a remastered form .
well , actually I think his dream has gone further and we are seeing the sovietisation of the eu .
it is high time that we introduced a common , eu wide policy in this field .
the european union is dependent on energy imports .
energy consumption is continuing to grow , but the natural resources are limited .
at the moment , our houses are supplied with electrical current without us knowing where it comes from .
written explanations of vote
the serious crisis in the dairy farming sector is putting the very survival of dairy farming at risk .
this report is welcome in this context .
in writing . the fight against terrorism has been high on the agenda of this house .
for this reason , I have voted against the motion for a resolution .
in writing . I and my british conservative colleagues can agree with much of this report .
the motion for a resolution that is being put before us today is truly mind boggling .
those who want to see a better europe should vote against this resolution .
that is the reason for my decision .
and most importantly , to ensure that farmers receive a fair and adequate price for their production .
regrettably , that has not been the case .
i am voting in favour of this resolution , although it does not go far enough .
the milk quota system will still need to continue after 2015 or be replaced with another regulatory mechanism .
that is why we have voted in favour .
it must also encourage better organisation within the sectors .
europe must act now .
the commission has stood by and watched this development for far too long .
the comprehensive agricultural reform that we have adopted is too little .
with this resolution , we are ready to take responsibility for european agriculture .
in writing . de we saved the banks , because we had to .
the army of unemployed is large enough .
allowing farms to go bust would be irresponsible on social , economic and environmental grounds .
the price of their products has fallen rapidly .
that is why I opposed amendment 28 , calling for a freeze in quotas , as too simplistic .
personally , I support the fixing of a minimum price for milk in each country .
however , all these measures have been rejected by the european parliament .
producers have a right to expect parliament to put forward the radical measures they need .
europe is highly dependent on imported energy .
the next item is the commission's statement on the situation in taiwan following the recent typhoon .
on 7 august 2009 taiwan was hit by typhoon morakot , causing major flooding and mudslides .
over 150 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the republic of taiwan was shaken to its foundations on 8 august .
thousands lost their belongings and large areas of land were laid waste .
the damage amounts to more than eur 2.5 billion .
as a token of our solidarity , we europeans wished to support the taiwanese people by providing disaster relief .
it is all the more surprising that the taiwanese embassies were instructed to refuse all foreign aid .
another cause of irritation was the visit to taiwan by the dalai lama over several days in september .
sympathy has long been the message of the much acclaimed speeches and books of the dalai lama .
on this occasion china showed great sensitivity by sending immediate aid to help taiwanese victims .
over 700 people lost their lives and thousands of others have faced major disruption .
happily , after typhoon morakot hit , the commission and the council indicated their willingness to help .
droughts , floods and a rapid increase in extreme weather are gradually increasing due to climate change .
the increase in temperature will considerably increase both the number of typhoons and their intensity .
to date , 120 million people are living in areas affected by typhoons .
between 1980 and 2000 , there were 250 000 typhoon victims .
we must pay by giving financial support to developing countries .
thousands of survivors , if not more , are being put up in military camps for the time being .
now it is time for us to help .
is there an emergency action package or provisions for specific countries ?
the big problem , however , alongside this human catastrophe , is , of course , taiwan's isolation .
all of this is possible and is no obstacle to the one china policy .
taiwan could have been better pre warned if the wmo provided it with timely information .
the aim is to help victims as quickly as possible .
we will continue to do so .
second , we aim to have a comprehensive approach to disaster prevention at eu level .
unfortunately , we were not able to support them enough while they were alive .
anna politkovskaya once said that the west can do so much , but the west does so little .
applause 
author . mr president , allow me to present the chamber with a few facts .
in august , journalist malik akhmedilov was shot dead shortly after leaving his home in dagestan .
human rights violations in russia , and especially in north caucasus , can no longer be ignored .
i am reminded of this story when human rights issues come up .
we are not a diplomatic body we are a political parliamentary body .
there is a saying that goesthe fish stinks from the head down.
these people are being murdered one after the other .
journalists and ngo workers in russia risk their lives every day in the course of their work .
i am concerned that cases like the murder of anna politkovskaya are not investigated .
personally , I also expect human rights issues to be discussed honestly in this house .
the theory that these murders arecoincidentalis not a viable one .
i think that our resolution is well balanced and will help the russians resolve this matter .
we know that the crucial thing that is lacking is a will to do thateverything.
pl we are indeed discussing human rights violations in russia on a day of significant symbolic value .
today's russia is not brave enough to face this horrific truth .
we will remember you all .
these attacks , this onslaught against human rights activists in russia , have had very worrying effects .
the effects of these murders are therefore unpredictable and worrying .
in fact , I am going to the russian embassy tomorrow to get my visa .
let us work together to prevent this from happening to human rights .
what would be the right course of action at a time like this ?
i believe that the break with totalitarianism must be clearly affirmed by every one of us .
the commission knows many of them .
they are highly respected partners in the implementation of human rights projects .
we welcome the more open attitude president medvedev has taken to discussions with the eu on these issues .
the next eu russia summit is another opportunity to continue these discussions .
kazakhstan the case of yevgeny zhovtis
now let us turn to the zhovtis case .
there must be a clear line drawn here .
that being the case , we must first take account of the judgment handed down .
are we seriously suggesting that the sentence is too harsh for somebody who was convicted of manslaughter ?
i hope the house will throw out these resolutions and support the amendments .
in addition , we have heard of several cases of the arbitrary arrest of human rights activists .
that is the solution , not condensing the whole agenda into wednesday .
this is actually a very difficult case .
on the domestic front , it is true that there are also some very positive developments in syria .
however , in terms of political freedom and political plurality , there has been absolutely no progress .
it is not enough just to focus cooperation on improving the economic situation .
only in that way can we make human life worthwhile .
he was also denied the right to leave the country .
with this agreement we will establish a regular dialogue to advise on these issues and achieve better results .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at the end of the debates .
murder of human rights activists in russia vote

proposal for a decision 
fr mr president , we wish the following phrase to be added to point a 
we thought that the developing countriespoint of view was not reflected within the mandate .
voting time
written explanations of vote 
it is national governments and national taxpayers who pay when banks have to be bailed out .
it follows therefore that banking supervision must be carried out on a national basis and not via the eu .
it is always necessary to go through everything in order .
we shall now go to the main item on this afternoon's agenda .
we hope to see it in just a week or a couple of weeks .
as president of the european council , I am responsible for moving the work of the union forward .
i strongly feel that we have no time to lose .
this is indeed a major achievement .
it was decided democratically .
now what we need is the ratification procedures to be concluded .
of course , we have to see the completion of the process in the czech republic .
it is an important aspect of how the european union does its business .
we need to fix exactly how the new system should work .
finally , I would like to mention the european citizensinitiative .
you can count on the ppe to help work progress quickly .
heckling 
china has 1.3 billion inhabitants . india has 1.1 billion .
these two countries together represent a third of the world's population !
it is clear that , in the 21st century , brazil is the stronger country .
so I am happy .
we need action and we need action urgently .
and we still do not have to wait for several weeks and months .
i agree with you there is no time to waste with this current economic and financial crisis .
what needs to be understood is that referendums in europe only make sense if they have consequences .
so you react depending on your mood .
the second thing which we need to understand clearly is the situation we are in .
i should like to say something now about the process and here I disagree with you , mr reinfeldt .
i have one thing to say to you .
we should all reflect on that .
as a result , this policy has led to an increase in poverty and inequality in europe .
we will not support global military missions in order to assert our own interests .
the whole thing was a travesty !
heckling 
oh , so you respect this vote , do you ?
i suspect that for ireland , their period of independence will be a very brief one in their history .
but it looks like we have got the victory of bureaucracy over national democracy .
mixed reactions 
she did not use the wordonlybut she might easily have done .
it would certainly have resulted in a rejection .
that is good .
once the 27th country has ratified , we will move on .
thank you very much for your comments , and thank you for your support .
regarding some comments , I want to underline certain points , and to reassure some members of parliament .
i am sorry there will not be apresident of europe.
we have to respect the institutions .
if we have lisbon , there will be a president of the european council .
what they want to see is the action to actually begin to deal with these crises .
they want tangible action , not rhetoric .
farming groups were strongly in favour of the treaty and they were very active in this campaign .
this is a major change from the last referendum , and it was clear to be seen .
i would also ask the social democratic members to make that clear .
ga mr president , the people of ireland have spoken .
it was not .
we heard the president tell parliament earlier that thenoside will be respected .
ireland is a democratic state .
that is not democracy .
es mr president , this parliament is the palace of the imagination , the palace of dreams .
de mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the majority is happy and relieved .
we have work to do now and we must not waste any time .
our citizens want a clear and substantive answer .
the treaty of lisbon has been ratified and must enter into force as soon as possible .
this one was therefore by no means the first .
the eurosceptics are indeed poor losers .
is the democracy in europe perfect ?
let us remember how the european union tried to boycott austria when jörg haider came into power .
we cannot pressurise our member states .
ireland experienced european solidarity during the crisis .
european solidarity is a good thing .
the treaty opens up new opportunities .
that will be the litmus test including in the commission hearings .
it is not worthy of the treaty of lisbon , it is not worthy of europe .
what happened in ireland in the referendum was not a victory for democracy .
the eu commission intervened continually interfered in the process .
he is the regulator of transport , supposed to protect consumers and workers .
he is hopelessly compromised by going around with the chief executive of one of the biggest corporations supplying transport .
finally , there is speculation that mr tony blair will be the new president of the eu council .
under no circumstances can he be 
the president cut off the speaker 
mr president , I should like to ask mr higgins what would have enabled him to support the treaty .
there is nothing in the treaty in that sense that a committed socialist could support .
nevertheless , we coped we were independent .
you did not reconsider the matter after a year , or two or even five years .
fi mr president , this is a bad agreement for small countries .
it will weaken ireland's voice , denmark's voice and finland's voice in the council of ministers .
this time the result was 67 % in favour and 33 % against .
what happened and why ?
i maintain that it was fear .
this vote represents the decision of ireland's citizens to continue the process of developing the european union .
this voice will be speaking on behalf of the 27 or more member states .
poland announced that it is going to ratify the treaty immediately .
the debate has echoes of shakespeare to be or not to be for europe .
if we are not there , then we will count for nothing , and will carry no influence .
we have lost years .
europe has fallen behind in international terms .
the president cut off the speaker 
i want britain to enjoy warm and friendly relationships with all our european neighbours .
in my opinion , the repeat referendum in ireland sets a dangerous precedent for the whole european community .
the president cut off the speaker 
now these supporters are happy because this treaty is close to being implemented , and that is fair enough .
i believe that it will result in a centralised superstate .
they cannot get away from this fact .
the president cut off the speaker 
the clear irishyesis good news for ireland and good news for the whole of europe .
in my opinion , prevarication and obstruction bring no dignity to the role and position of the czech president .
i think there were several points that were in the eu's favour this time .
you are not in a strong position if you are alone when storms are raging in the world .
now it is the turn of poland and the czech republic to ratify the treaty .
he has a good relationship with david cameron .
what he has no respect for is the unfair and biased way in which the referendum campaign was conducted .
if it is the first case , then it is a 3 3 score draw .
pl mr president , the irish people have saidyesto the european union .
it should also be remembered that the treaty of lisbon is a compromise on the previous eu draft constitution .
the president cut off the speaker 
therefore , many voters stayed at home .
eu democracy is a one way street .
there was no fair campaign .
the voters were intimidated .
the economic crisis was used as a lever to force people to voteyes.
i would like to say thank you to nigel farage .
that is what is known as unintended consequences , but we are grateful for his intervention .
david cameron's position on the lisbon treaty is quite untenable .
they pretend they have changed but they clearly have not .
may this prove to be the final relinquishment of german and french plans to standardise taxation in the eu .
i have consistently opposed the federalism of the lisbon treaty and the ceding of powers from nation states .
a document harmful to british national interests on 2 october 2009 is equally as harmful on 2 october 20i believe that the treaty of lisbon is a decisive step towards involving national parliaments in european democracy .
we are therefore very pleased with the irish people's decision .
what has changed ?
a lot .
that is what matters .
thenoto start with and then theyes.
i shall repeat what numerous members have said .
the social crisis is europe capable of having an employment policy ?
mt I too , welcome the result of the irish referendum with pleasure .
allow me to make an observation .
our civil rights , as citizens , are to be strengthened by this treaty .
the government also supported the ratification of the treaty , and parliament ratified the treaty .
i believe that this is a good thing , which makes holding the double referendum worthwhile .
the irish people have clearly stated that they believe in the european project .
it will never happen .
we can now finally embark on creating an eu structure for protecting minorities .
adoption of the treaty means a new phase and an opportunity for the eu to make a step forward .
those extremists met their match last friday .
generally , the processes for ratifying european treaties too often look like sagas or pyrrhic victories .
you have often heard about communication deficit .
that would have to be the subject of the referendum and not a treaty that has been ratified .
that would be totally unacceptable .
i think we need to learn something from this , and that is that our citizens need more information .
the eu's own security and development also depend on this .
finally , I would like to say one more thing thank you , ireland .
any delay would create problems for farmers throughout the member states .
i am sure that the treaty will also be ratified by the czech republic .
we all want the institutional impasse we have faced for almost 10 years to finally come to an end .
we can now look forward optimistically to finalising ratification .
our journey thus far has been long and arduous .
what can this be attributed to ?
one reason is that the irish were given a guarantee .
the european union is a union which saysyesrather thanno.
however , there are at least two aspects that require caution .
i only wish that we were smarter than that .
this is not fair and is , in my view , morally wrong .
the irony is that under the lisbon treaty there will be a full time president .
god save our queen !
i am making an sos appeal on behalf of the romanian people .
unfortunately , the hungarian parliament was the first to do this .
if you listen to the people , you ask them why did you voteno?
with this clarification you have a new referendum .
the people answeredyeswith a two thirds majority and with a higher turnout than last time .
we need a few days to grasp and to assess the situation in the constitutional court .
there will be .
i would very much welcome if one of those top jobs could go to a woman .
we need to do that .
thank you very much for an interesting debate , mr president .
could I just start with some facts .
i think it is very important to say this .
and why did they do that ?
and this is what was done .
the concerns of the irish people were listened to and they did it themselves in ireland .
why do we have to explain ?
the debate is closed .
this will give the eu a stronger voice globally , once its institutions have been set up and reformed .
2010 is the year when we hope the treaty will come into force .
the delay has now lasted for over one and a half years .
this is unjustified , reprehensible , and even illegal .
in not fulfilling this obligation , he is breaking the law .
in accordance with the constitution of the republic of poland , there are two possible ways .
the polish people do not want to hinder development of the european union .
president kaczyński does not have the right to interfere with this .
we wait with hope for the final ratifications of the treaty .
contrary to what its opponents say , the treaty does not bring any major revolution .
situation in guinea debate 
the next item is the council statement on the situation in guinea .
president in office of the council . mr president , we move from one item to the next .
during the violent repression , several opposition leaders were wounded and temporarily arrested .
we will have to insist on the liberation of the arrested prisoners and a thorough investigation of the events .
we have not been alone .
our international partners have acted in line with us .
captain camara's decision not to run could allow calm to return .
we discuss the effectiveness of development cooperation fairly often .
yesterday , mr camara accused france of humiliating africans by breaking off relations with guinea .
you also told us that all aid had been frozen , except for humanitarian and food aid .
the organisations on the ground are warning us of the risk of ethnic conflict .
it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mrs malmström described the situation in guinea perfectly .
it reflects the commission's evaluation of the previous agreement .
we have no idea where the money from these fisheries agreements will end up .
we have the international contact group .
we are also open to answering other questions and to discuss sanctions .
we are also discussing this with the commission , and I am sorry they are not here right now .
thank you very much , mrs malmström .
one minute speeches on matters of political importance
the next item is the one minute speeches on matters of political importance .
however , gas is not the only energy resource available to european states .
changes are being forced on polish surnames , so that they look like lithuanian ones .
unfortunately , these declarations are contradicted by reality on a daily basis .
the situation in northern portugal is an illustration of this .
i would like your constituencies to ask you to do that , too .
incidentally , the situation is the same if I try to speak in english .
welcome to absurdistan !
however , you did not utilise this opportunity .
all I can say to that is that this is not what I call democracy .
that is what we stand for and that is what we are fighting for .
not even those who committed war crimes during the balkan war have been given such stiff sentences .
during the same period , around 300 hungarians were beaten in serbia without any legal repercussions .
even more than that , it is their future that is at stake here .
this is extremely urgent .
finally , I come to this high level group , this think tank that was launched the day before yesterday .
it is also important to point out that from childhood , mr ivanilovas has suffered from bronchial asthma .
this is the instruction concerning the protection of personal data in the activity of the catholic church in poland .
i deeply regret the need to raise this matter in this chamber .
however , hyperbole can turn to insanity .
nevertheless , we should be compassionate .
hu ladies and gentlemen , a great deal has already been said today about minority issues .
the other lesson to be learnt is that the minorities were involved in drafting this law .
hu there has been much talk earlier about minorities .
political and economic decision makers have a responsibility to take heed of people with disabilities .
the treaty now obliges the european institutions to be more democratic and more responsive to individual european people .
on this point , I wish to mention a specific example from romania .
that is why I urge the commission to review the rules on state aid support .
parliament should adopt , for instance , a minority framework law that guarantees minoritiesrights .
minorities are entitled to feel safe .

prevention and settlement of conflicts of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings debate 
the commission welcomes the report and supports some of the proposed amendments .
eurojust has already proved in the years since its establishment that it deserves our trust .
i will finish by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for the way they worked on this report .
the ppe position differs from that of the rapporteur on two matters .
if there is a possibility of the two parties reaching consensus , why introduce another body and procedure ?
we cannot support a european penal code or a european code of criminal procedure .
our duty is therefore to ensure that these procedural guarantees are abided by in all member states .
i believe that mrs macovei is right .
ro I wish to congratulate the rapporteur and the co rapporteur for the fine job they have done .
there is no provision intended to deal with negative conflicts of jurisdiction .
the basic principle of this directive is to initiate direct communication between the relevant authorities in the member states .
i would like to thank you once more for holding this debate .
the debate is closed .
rules governing the exchange of information between the authorities of the member states conducting such criminal proceedings 
author . madam president , I would like to thank commissioner tajani for being with us this evening .
it is a loophole which parliament , with the assistance of the commission , is seeking to close .
the commission has already started work to come up with a practical response to these issues .
you intend to present a proposal over the next year .
madam president , thank you , commissioner , for your response .
indeed , mr simpson has already presented it to us .
this gap relates to the insolvency of airlines , as has already been discussed .
in this regard , I am pleased to hear you say that you are working on a solution .
i am looking forward to the discussion in committee , which may perhaps even take place this year .
a fair market will not only protect passengers from unfair practices , it will protect the competitors , too .
madam president , over the last nine years , nearly 80 airlines have gone bankrupt in the european union .
the problem has not been restricted to low cost carriers , although these have accounted for most of the failures .
it is a matter of capital adequacy and insurance for return journeys .
companies are going bankrupt in the economic recession and airline companies are no exception .
therefore , it was with amazement that I listened to the explanations of the skyeurope spokesman .
i stress the wordinconvenience.
skyeurope was a listed company , and so we had more information about it .
in the case of other cut price airlines , this is not always so .
yes , solidarity , an idea which is , to me , as a pole , especially dear .
any costs involved would be settled between the airlines concerned .
i would like to ask the commissioner for a reply .
its services were used by a wide range of customers .
passengers must therefore make their claims in bankruptcy proceedings .
the chances of getting money back in this way are negligible .
it is therefore time to do something about this .
madam president , passengerscompensation in the case of airline bankruptcies is not only a question of money .
for example , in 2004 , the polish airline air polonia went bankrupt .
the vote on any motions for resolutions will take place during the next part session .
we would regularly see on television pictures of families stranded abroad .
we must think about tightening the rules on setting up companies .
the deadline was five years , but there is no report from the european commission .
in 2001 , council regulation no 2157 / 2001 on the statute for a european company was adopted .
the regulation came into force in 200agenda for next sitting see minutes
i mean radio spectrum policy .
we had an example of this as recently as yesterday in italy .
exclamation by mr schulz 
interruption by mr schulz 
we know who the troublemakers are .
it does not bother me .
i am not annoyed . mr president .
are the italian courts prevented from enforcing the law ?
the answer to all of these questions is clearly no .
to claim the opposite is to ignore the reality of matters no one is fooled by that .
i did not have this opportunity in the time that was allocated to me .
the president asked the members to allow the speaker to continue 
it is my decision .
applause 
i am entitled to do this , and we must move on with our discussion .
that cannot be true .
this is one of the copenhagen criteria . everybody has to stick to the copenhagen criteria .
applause 
this heated debate shows that something is going on .
the way things are going in italy makes that country very vulnerable in its democracy .
perhaps there have been similar situations in other countries .
similar situations have occurred in other countries .
if there is a problem , then at such a time we should always talk about it .
almost 10 years later , we are paying the price . this is a highly dangerous development .
where is this directive ?
mrs reding , what are you afraid of ?
what forces are at work here ?
it is almost exclusively the governing political parties .
in fact , in 2004 , a debate was held in this house on freedom of information in italy .
there was a centre right government , and there was a prime minister silvio berlusconi .
following the victory of the left in 2006 , the problem miraculously disappeared .
such sponsors account for up to 68 % of these actions .
simply lost .
the president cut off the speaker 
our group feels that media pluralism is not just an italian issue .
i would point out that only in china do such things happen .
i would have nothing against a european discussion on that issue here as well .
that is my opinion .
he is probably the very last person who should be speaking about this .
the largest source of income for the spd today is its media interests .
it is true , there are no laws against freedom of the press as yet .
this is the situation in which we therefore find ourselves .
you champions of freedom of the press against censorship !
he had to go on a hunger strike what fine freedom fighters !
what freedom does the italian press federation grant to the minority ?
what fine freedom fighters !
go to tehran , go to tehran , cowards , cowards , cowards , cowards !
long live freedom , long live our free and democratic country .
not once in our speeches have we mentioned the italian prime minister .
that is not the problem , however .
we are all aware of the italian prime minister's colourful character .
however , this is not the issue here .
the answer to that is clear .
commissioner reding very strangely said that we should not use the eu institutions to solve national problems .
that legal basis exists and must be complemented by legislation on media diversity and pluralism .
while listening to the debate , two questions occurred to me .
is it as important a fundamental right as freedom of speech ?
it certainly is .
ro freedom of the press is never given adequate protection against abuse .
we have heard the information supplied by our fellow members .
freedom of the press in italy has , in the berlusconi government , the most generous of backers .
over the last three years , 200 journalists have been threatened on account of what they have written .
today , parliament has a unique opportunity to bring out and reveal our most positive attributes .
italy's concerns are also our own .
for the benefit of the non italian members , I will take the liberty of doing a press review .
then there is the refoundation party , which has its own newspaper , liberazione .
lastly , there is the political subject of this debate il fatto quotidiano .
it refers to mr di pietro's party , which is the driving force behind this debate today .
one of these is the united kingdom .
bg thank you , madam president .
the president again requested silence 
they will be the basis for our future work .
this is a fundamental question that has to be discussed in depth .
all this would need to be clarified before we could start a legislative process .
i think , in the end , that is what the parliament wants .
applause 
we german social democrats are proud of our media interests !
half an hour later , the ambulance arrived to treat mrs niebler .
one's safety is not guaranteed in this city .
. nor are responses from the authorities .

the vote will take place during the second october part session .

voting time
the next item is the vote .
what I do strongly oppose , however , is the federalist tone of various amendments .
this is not going to be easy , but I believe that we are moving in the right direction .
so the g20 leaders get together and they saywhat is the solution ?
and now we want to reform the entire financial system .
the implementation of the millennium goals is now at serious risk .
i see this report as a seed at least .
nl madam president , the hypocrisy and inconsistency of this house continue to amaze me .
however , we also need to work on underdevelopment as a form of prevention .
i am therefore in agreement that the mobilisation of the esf is justified and have voted in favour .
technical reasons cannot be used to postpone voting on reports which have serious repercussions for european citizens .
in writing . I voted in favour of amendment this could well be the highest amount ever granted to date by this fund .
with this vote , parliament is thus showing full solidarity and unity with the affected populations .
in writing . I welcome the positive vote releasing funding for the abruzzo earthquake victims .
improving judicial cooperation in criminal proceedings between authorities which have parallel competences is a particularly important measure .
hence , I have voted in the affirmative .
we voted against this report because of the strengthening of the role of eurojust that it aims to establish .
on the one hand , the economic crisis and its social consequences require urgent measures to restore job creating growth .
the european union needs stricter financial market supervision , for which one institution would be accountable g20 .
nonetheless , they have not signed the joint resolution so that they can make a scene in plenary .
in writing . I voted in favour of the resolution on the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
together with the other countries of europe , we will be able to overcome the challenges we currently face .
furthermore , the amendment suggests that a unilateral european form of such a tax should be considered .
in writing . I abstained from the vote on amendment 8 on a financial transaction tax .
there is no penetration through to real , needed reforms .
it is for that reason that I have abstained from voting .
it is therefore even more important to adopt appropriate rules for the markets quickly .
these are current global issues , universally considered vital for the european growth process .
we think that a more detailed discussion of how international financial transactions should be handled is needed .
this has a massive impact on their already weak economies and will put millions more people out of work .
we europeans must therefore support these countries in building up their economies .
we think that a more detailed discussion of how international financial transactions should be handled is needed .
the crisis may also be a new opportunity .
providing aid to developing countries is one duty that the european union must not abandon .
the new , sound workings of international finance will have to be based on fairness .
that concludes the explanations of vote .

fr mr president , my speech relates , in fact , to monday's agenda .
i note that these issues have disappeared from the debate and I find that deeply regrettable .
had there been a request , we could have considered this matter in a different way .
there is no discussion on the agenda because of the absence of any kind of motion on this matter .
tuesday 
no amendments have been proposed .
wednesday 
not every issue in europe is an issue for europe .
the italian parliament has just proven that it is independent .
mr president , this is actually something of a humiliating spectacle .
we want to say something in general about freedom of opinion in europe .
we should not try and do everything .
thank you for your attention .
30 % of police officers , 30 % of schoolteachers and 30 % of doctors have lost their jobs .
all this has led to a social explosion .
we must really care for the food security of our continent .
thank you .
the money is largely directed towards developing sustainable economic growth and creating jobs .
together , they form an unpleasant cocktail of old soviet design and american engineering .
the parties to the proceedings have no possibility of obtaining judicial review of the final decision .
i should like to take this opportunity to call on the community to firmly oppose this construction project .
a large number of meps , from four different groups , have signed an appeal along these lines .
these tv repeaters allow the reception of catalan television in the valencia region .
one small example is austria , where the income divide is about 28 % .
this means that repression is once again intensifying in this former spanish colony .
frontex is currently facing a number of problems .
it would fully accord with the principles of intermodality and would have a balanced influence on the natural environment .
in both cases , the commission cannot abandon its producers and we cannot allow that to happen .
since then , his detention period has been repeatedly extended by the israeli army .
a military judge is due to rule on his detention on tuesday 20 october i.e. tomorrow .
this can then serve as an example for the entire area to the east of the eu .
the only ones still making their minds up are president václav klaus and the czech constitutional court .
i must express our concern publicly and say that we will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed .
this was presumably under the political order of the party which has succeeded the communist dictatorship .
it took 50 years after 1956 for hungarian blood to be shed again on the streets of budapest .
experience has taught us that in situations like these , we should not remain silent .
pt regional differences remain a challenge in the context of an enlarged european union .
el mr president , I should like to speak about accidents at work in greece and europe .
the statistics for my country , greece , are tragic .
and it is strange , I have finished , mr president .
the president cut off the speaker 
still some europeans contest the project , ignoring its new orientation .
sk I would like to warn you that representatives of hungary are attempting to provoke slovakia .
on 21 august 20 years ago , a soviet and hungarian army invaded the former czechoslovakia .
today , he is protesting that he was denied entry into slovakia .
i would like to tell you that there is no legal basis for an eu policy on sport .
nevertheless , I am disappointed with the proposals put forward by the european commission .
indeed , the only new thing , which I applaud , is the possibility of carrying out unannounced visits .
however , it would also be possible to apply the codecision procedure for the draft regulation .
political will is the only deciding factor between the two possibilities .
the citizens must have access to the results of these evaluations .
so that is the first response .
when it comes to external borders , trust is placed in a country and trust is gained in return .
restricting the role of an institution like the european parliament is wrong .
i propose to you that we support the draft resolution .
the commission , when it works at its best , is the one to do it .
nevertheless , we parliamentarians have a number of concerns .
i shall not remind you about the role of the european parliament as an elected institution .
we have heard already that , under the lisbon treaty , the codecision procedure will be the only option .
we fully support the rapporteur and we also support his proposal .
i cannot , however , support the conclusions of the rapporteur , our fellow member , carlos coelho .
de mr president , we need a democratic revolution .
the aim of this mandate is to make the schengen evaluation mechanism more efficient .
all the same , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report .
over the centuries , people's movement has been severely curtailed in europe .
suspicion of our fellow men has dominated relations between the countries of europe .
it is easy to forget the arduous road to get to that point .
i urge the commission to come up with a new and better proposal as quickly as possible .
the commission is right to worry .
so here we are , wasting our time , thank you very , very much .
the incorporation of the nine new member states was possible only under exceptional conditions , of course .
however , we are still miles away from that .
after all , it was not created for the politicians or for international organisations , but for particular states .
these measures form the basis of the mutual confidence that is crucial to good cooperation in the schengen area .
it is something I would support entry into .
schengen has worked extremely well and it is visible for all to see .
madam president , we have survived the cold snap here , in this chamber .
our aim is not to exclude parliament , as I heard someone say .
this was no surprise to me .
in the first place , there can be no breach in consistency .
all parties must be involved .
the joint debate is closed .
schengen cooperation can take many different forms .
there you have it I am grateful to parliament and to mr busuttil for his cooperation .
it reinforces this initiative , which will thus make travelling easier for our fellow citizens .
we in the gue / ngl group are in favour of abolishing all short stay visas .
we do have one small point one small technical point to make however , commissioner .
firstly , with this decision , which facilitates movement , we are disproving the idea of a fortress europe .
either the whole european area is accepted or it is not .
this goes for my colleagues as well as for the vice president of the european commission , jacques barrot .
brazil , with whom negotiations have recently taken place , is another case in point .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
progress of sis ii and vis debate 
the next item is the commission statement on the progress of sis ii and vis .
for the first milestone , there is an extra cost of eur 1 026 000 .
i do not believe , but I may be proved wrong , that there is a design problem .
the tests should be concluded on 11 november .
there is real cause for concern there is no point in hiding it .
i think you will understand why we tabled a joint resolution , because there is a genuine concern here .
in our resolution , we do not want to be seen to be making unreasonable demands .
could you tell us what those penalties are ?
what are the estimated extra costs envisaged ?
we can , I guess , expect some further slippage .
in answers to me , the government has said that it is not worried about any implications for security .
we also regret that more and more authorities have access to these systems .
i would also like to ask what action has been taken against contractors to secure some damages .
it is a pragmatic approach , even if we are strongly criticised for it .
clearly , it is easier to exercise parliamentary scrutiny of the commission than of the council .
there have been many problems and delays .
in his political life , he has always shown himself to be competent , serious and a true pro european .
why do we need sis ii ?
this raises a number of questions .
we are now talking about it being developed perhaps over 10 years .
this , therefore , raises several questions .
is the european commission ready to implement an alternative plan ?
will this equipment be used in the alternative plan ?
mrs ždanoka talked to me about biometric data and controlling access to the system .
we reached an overall agreement at the end of july .
i wish to say that parliament is welcome to help us spur on the co contractor .
thank you for your reply , commissioner .
i have received three motions for resolutions to wind up this debate .

this gesture was one of great attentiveness which we appreciated .
it failed to react in any way for months as the crisis went on .
the commission has also failed to say how it intends to reinforce the producer organisations going forwards .
we , parliament , have long been fighting for more rights particularly in the field of agriculture .
we must not , however , give up any responsibility .
we must provide the dairy farmers with serious and long lasting help .
i can partially agree with what the previous speaker said .
climate change and developing countries in the framework of the un conference on climate change in copenhagen debate 
mr president , we are at a decisive point in time .
negotiations are moving too slowly , however .
a number of key issues have not yet been resolved .
let me make one thing clear that is not what the eu is here to do .
we want the eu to show leadership by expressing a clear , unequivocal political will .
this means planning low carbon growth , integrating climate measures and adapting national development strategies .
the european council has concluded that climate change is undermining efforts to combat poverty and achieve sustainable development .
we will particularly highlight development issues within the context of the ongoing negotiations .
adaptation measures are required in this regard .
the council is aware of the scale of the financing required .
it is not a matter of choosing one or the other both are essential .
expectations are very high .
it is now the time for putting offers on the table .
finally , a word on the delivery channels for climate funding .
i have been involved with this since the climate conference in rio in 199the mood before these conferences is always the same , but there are also opportunities .
let us develop criteria for how the money is used .
enough has been said about the crisis .
mr president , climate change is responsible for more than 300 000 deaths each year .
the union cannot reasonably pledge less than eur 35 billion in public finances .
mr president , mr carlgren , commissioner , I would like to begin by responding to the previous speech .
our scientific approach should not be changed .
we have no influence on what the sun does .
as we all know , it determines a great deal of the climate on our planet .
these two themes are intimately linked .
man made global warming is an unproven theory based on manipulative statistics .
the eu has a vital responsibility .
ultimately , this is a matter of solidarity .
consequently , both oda resources and new funding will be required .
as mr florenz says , we need to cooperate with major nations such as the us .
this is not simply a competition .
yet the united states and the emerging economies , too , must put their hands in their pockets .
i see positive incentives for green investments and innovations by enterprises as more promising than a new european tax .
we have to resolve two specific issues if we are to prove the pessimists wrong .
i would like to ask mr carlgren whether he has the council's backing for his high ambitions .
the gamble has not yet paid off , as the presidency has just pointed out .
the european union must remain credible when it comes to the impact of climate change on developing countries .
skimping on that objective is out of the question .
once again , this is a time for eu leadership .
it is obvious that the eur 2 15 billion proposed by the commission cannot be enough .
the bali action plan put that well .
they , too , must face up to their responsibilities .
forests , including the tropical rainforests , counteract a substantial proportion of co2 emissions .
we cannot transform the legitimate battle to protect the environment into a war between poor peoples .
there were many people who optimistically expected that barack obama would bring about major changes and travel to copenhagen .
without success .
this is , indeed , a key matter .
in copenhagen this december , the world faces the historic task of giving substance to those words .
meanwhile , the oil disappears unhindered from these developing countries , often without fair payment reaching their treasuries .
in the future , climate change will cost developing countries more than eur 100 billion per year .
of course , there are climate measures that can also stimulate the development of poor countries .
planting trees helps to combat desertification .
we must break through this logic in copenhagen by introducing new financing mechanisms .
this fund must be introduced , therefore , for the eu and for the world .
inaction is a crime against humanity .
this is an emergency , but the negotiations are at a virtual standstill .
however , it is europe that holds the key to copenhagen .
let us be clear we really have no choice .
at present , fossil fuels provide for almost 85 % of the world's energy needs .
a pollutant !
isn't this all about politics and big business ?
one hypothesis is that the global temperature will continue to rise .
we heard something about polling .
in fact , only 10 % of europeans said it was not a serious issue at all .
about three years ago , fiona hall and I went to northern kenya .
why ?
you could say that agriculture is the big villain in this context .
in developing countries , the land is drying out and diseases are spreading .
so I wonder will you offer eur 35 40 billion a year in new aid for climate measures ?
will you accept compulsory licensing of important green technology to the poorest countries ?
going beyond a declaration of intent shows that we are decided and serious about fundamental issues such as financing .
this is the fairer option .
applause 
it makes no difference to the earth's atmosphere where the co2 comes from .
only new technology can enable us to maintain our way of life .
the climate is a global problem , but has not been tackled by sharing the best available technology .
this was a complete failure under kyoto , and so let us learn the lessons .
particularly enterprises at the forefront of such development must be encouraged and rewarded accordingly .
i would welcome mr carlgren's comments on this .
all countries must play their part in terms of achieving targets and sustainable development .
the developing world must be supported and encouraged , but the targets set for these nations must be realistic .
i am , though , glowing hot in my opposition to the concept of man made climate change .
it is a vital and irreplaceable food for plant life .
a shortage of this gas will be far more serious than a surplus .
developed countries are not going to do it and developing countries are even less likely to do so .
we know about the great difficulties that will result if we do not accept our international responsibilities .
have you ever played russian roulette ?
of course not , because you have one chance in six of being killed or injured .
talk of 2020 or 2050 is not good enough .
let me just say this there is talk of plants and co2 there is deforestation and desertification .
this means that in some places there is no water .
climate change kills .
that is eur 30 billion per annum .
we are a month and a half away from copenhagen , just a few weeks away .
this was the message from various leaders at the recent united nations meeting .
this was the message from the president of the spanish government .
the council and the commission must do more in this connection .
other regions in the world , too , must do more .
shipping is the most efficient and environmentally friendly mode of transport , while aviation is more or less the worst .
let us remember that we must speak with one voice if we are to maintain our credibility .
copenhagen must also enable developing countries to move in the direction of low carbon models .
i heard it said just now that this is not enough , but it is already a good start .
we have a responsibility , but we also have duties towards these countries .
the european union will be judged on this contribution and on this commitment .
this will be the only way of making ourselves heard and of ensuring that our virtuous commitment has meaning .
there is something else which we must not forget , especially here in the european union .
this agreement should be based on the principle of shared yet differentiated responsibility .
all developing countries , with the exception of the least developed , should adopt national low carbon development strategies .
firstly , our efforts with regard to climate so far have brought us no benefits .
secondly , it has to be said that we know less than we thought we did some time ago .
now it has stopped increasing , and global cooling is predicted to continue over the years to come .
the world can no longer afford a poor agreement on climate .
however , we cannot limit ourselves to this .
therefore , parliament , in following the lead of certain national political leaders , is assuming its responsibilities .
the solutions that we come up with together must help to solve all three of these crises .
people all over the world expect the copenhagen conference to come up with vigorous measures .
this agricultural area covered by forest vegetation amounts to double the area of the amazon rainforest .
i agree with mr carlgren .
however , there is a single factor that affects all this climate change .
i would have liked minister carlgren to have prioritised things more .
however , let us accept for the moment that man made emissions are a bad thing for various reasons .
nor must we forget that climate change will require the contribution of science , technology and economics .
so climate change and global poverty will have to be tackled hand in hand .
there has been mention of the need to globally achieve low carbon development I agree with that .
then we will speak about the united states we will also speak about the bric countries .
the debate is closed .
the us seems unable to pass legislation to curb its excessive co2 emissions .
europeans have an historic responsibility to clean up the climate mess we helped create .
some say we cannot afford such new financing .
i strongly support the european union in having to maintain its leading position in the battle against climate change .
it must not slip to number two as a result of the current economic difficulties .
the european union plays an important role in , and assumes a commitment to , funding the climate programme .
the european decisions made recently facilitate this .
last but not least , the eu must adopt a uniform position for maintaining its leading role in negotiations .
when making decisions , we should also think of the citizens .
in the light of these studies , the eu's climate targets cannot be called too ambitious .
everyone knows how serious the problem is .
the only problem is that we have no time left .
however , it is not enough to cut greenhouse gas emissions to alleviate the impact of climate change .
additional action is required to alleviate this problem in the short term .
the eu is a world leader in the fight against climate change .
when we provide assistance , we must be responsible to a high degree for its consequences .
the links between developing countries and the developed world are complex .
the greatest proportion of the resources should be targeted on supporting education and the information society .
even in the european parliament , not everyone is convinced that climate change is a real threat .

written explanations of vote
i voted in favour of this report .
currently , there is no coordinated renewable energy strategy on both a european and world scale .
in writing . irena was officially established on 26 january 200the statute of this organisation has been concluded .
this vote refers to certain council acts in the field of the common agricultural policy .
acts such as these serve simply to confuse , without serving any real purpose .
during the process of european integration , many acts were passed in the european parliament and the council .
the commission lately declared 250 agricultural laws obsolete .
in writing . the government of malta should follow similar initiatives for the island of gozo .
the smaller islands of the maltese archipelago are particularly vulnerable .
i am in favour of such extension and have therefore voted in favour of this report .
in writing . this consists of a simple codification of texts without any change to their substance .
in practice , of course , this situation is shamelessly exploited .
in writing . this is a codification without any substantial changes and therefore I have voted in favour .

question hour with the president of the commission
i am very pleased to find this procedure now in the european parliament .
the process of ratification is still ongoing in the czech republic .
it was downgraded by some member states .
president of the commission . I have always supported my commissioners , including neelie kroes .
chairman of the alde group . nl I have no further questions .
mr verhofstadt , let us be clear .
but the reality is that others have to match our level of ambition .
it is also the way to protect small and medium sized companies with regard to the big monopolies or oligopolies .
co chairman of the efd group . mr barroso , it is very good to see you here .
consequences of the financial crisis on employment and social cohesion
in fact , it was also a cornerstone of your crisis and recovery plan .
we are linking those two issues .
certainly this is a matter that we should also consider for the next financial perspectives .
colleagues , could I ask you not to ask supplementary questions .
our objective is to strengthen social cohesion .
you need to tell the council that we cannot go on like this .
that is why we are promoting the common active inclusion principles as community policy .
that represents about eur 3 500 billion more !
exceptional measures were needed for what was an unprecedented situation .
how can we link these strategies that are available to us ?
how can we divide up the portfolios so as to take account of the lessons learnt from this crisis ?
with regard to the tools , I will cite just one example .
i therefore sent this letter only today .
i already announced the main innovations during my debate with you .
president of the commission . I would like to thank graham watson for this very important question .
we have to understand that the model of the future will not be like the model of the past .
that is where we can create new products , new markets .
i think innovation will be key for the development of the european economy in the future .
we have community level instruments , but there are some instruments that are national level instruments .
i do not think that shutting off europe is the solution for portugal or any other european country .
i think that it is in europe's best interests to maintain open global markets .
mr barroso , the financial crisis in the uk is very serious .
i have been told it is only 79 % accurate .
if there are problems in the implementation , we are ready to look at it .
let us see how it works in practice .
do you think , mr president , that this measure to help them is sufficient ?
hungary is in a particularly difficult position as it only has foreign commercial banks .
we have to do more for smes I think it is a priority .
we have approved the small business act that is good .
so I think smes should remain a priority of our action for sustainability , including sustainable employment .
thankfully , that day is now over so I will go on to my question .
this is , after all , an interactive work with the member states too .
that concludes the item .
section I european parliament
section ii council
section ix european data protection supervisor
is it able to protect the eu's borders ?
there are no major differences dividing political groups .
however , there is a serious difference of opinion between the council and parliament .
earlier , when we were thinking about 2010 , it was with a seven year budget in mind .
annual budgets also feature commitments , many of which remain unfulfilled .
if we have made mistakes , we do not want to prevent the programmes from being implemented .
we must also look more closely in the future at the extent to which our objectives have been achieved .
the european court of auditors recently published a survey on the successes and struggles of the dairy sector .
it is only natural that each political group will also promote their views and seek to raise their profile .
thank you for your respectful attention .
every institution and every unit of every institution must make every effort to achieve savings .
there have always been reserves here and many of them have even increased over recent years .
we have a common pot of funding .
buildings were not always purchased in the right place , at the right time or for the minimum cost .
europe is going through its worst economic crisis since the second world war .
it wants financing for administration !
the situation in palestine is , unfortunately , one of the best examples of this .
if our gnp goes down a percentage , our contribution to these people also goes down .
i will present three of them to you in one minute .
there are two things that we must impress on the commission .
in practice , however , their idea of prioritising is to implement cuts of 7 % .
above all , we demand that vigorous efforts be made in respect of research and innovation .
stockpiling and export refunds , however , were even being labelled as yesterday's tools two years ago .
the first is the question of implementing supervision structures at european level .
what the european union does , and why , should be fully known to the citizens .
however , I should like to issue a warning .
the budget must have the ability to be tangible and dynamic , to listen and to respond .
the commitments represent serious political intentions , but also real , concrete actions .
other matters also deserve special attention .
we support the draft budget put forward by mr surján .
i would also like to thank mr maňka for his work on the budget for other institutions .
now we may finally see it laid on the table .
that also means that we need to invest more money in research and development .
we need to change our agricultural policy , which must become more environmental in nature .
we greens take the view that the dairy farmers must be helped at this point .
we also want to redistribute money .
we want an ecological energy policy , we want broadband in rural areas and we want pan european electricity networks .
that is what we expect from the negotiations over the coming weeks .
so the three points I would like to make in the debate today are as follows .
here , however , we will be looking at the budget .
what we need is another policy for rural areas .
this is ridiculous and incomprehensible .
i hope that on thursday , we will at least have the decency to review this state of affairs .
is this the way this parliament wants to bring the budget closer to the citizens ?
europe was a guarantee for peace and prosperity for a long time .
let us work together to make sure that it continues to be just that .
that is not something we can ignore .
one of the results of the crisis is unemployment .
instead , large sums are repaid to the member states as rebates .
secondly , this year , the arguments for this are even stronger than usual .
it is a pity that the minister had to leave as I had a question for him .
there will be no net contribution to the baltic sea strategy .
europe's left instead demands that the european union implement a consistent peace policy .
the dutch public the class dunce is of course the largest net contributor once again .
perhaps we will be happier in the committee on budgets when the lisbon treaty enters into force .
however , the new powers will also mean new responsibilities .
firstly , the funding of the european economic recovery plan .
this is a disgrace .
the second matter is the dairy fund .
the council and the commission have just accepted eur 280 million .
we played our part in attaining that .
i have just heard mr van der stoep , another dutch representative , say he rejects these resources .
we have also increased the allocation for the programme of research for small and medium sized businesses .
for my part , I want to mention just one special matter .
the reason for this passivity is the administration and control system , which needs simplifying urgently .
i think members should resist all this .
this way of strengthening the economy strengthens the economies of countries in the far east .
this has evoked remarks and reservations from some politicians .
this is because the army also generates new technologies , and can create new , modern jobs .
i would therefore ask for more information on the subject .
perhaps you would like to get your answers to the members in question in writing .
i also entirely agree that everything he considers important parliament also considers important , such as education and research .
however , I must mention a few ideas expressed during the debate which I do not agree with .
this is spurious and misleading , and it will ruin our whole common future .
the political message is about how this parliament would like to lead the european union to greener pastures .
my time has run out .
the committee on budgets has also worked constructively with other institutions in the past .
an increase in the rate of community cofinancing in the structural and cohesion funds .
a development programme for portuguese industry 
a programme for supporting small scale , artisanal coastal fisheries 
an increase in funding for the life + programme .
preparing a budget is never an easy process , even less so during an economic crisis .
the european parliament has undoubtedly a crucial role to play in this debate .
the eu budget needs to make full use of the financial margins to respond to the economic crisis .
this clearly shows us that human rights cannot be divorced from democracy .
the entire development policy and the common foreign and security policy cover this whole spectrum .
the efforts made up to that point had been largely inadequate .
the israeli palestinian conflict is a striking example of this .
its conclusions are fair and balanced , and universal support for them would represent a step towards peace .
the persistent vagueness concerning the place accorded to human rights in our policies is reprehensible and counterproductive .
consequently , there can be no development without peace .
both require full respect for human rights .
how can we do this ?
well , by identifying specific ways of using the eu's instruments more effectively within a uniform framework .
that is why it is becoming a stable environment for democracy .
however , talking about human rights and democracy with our partner countries can never embody conditionality .
where are we now ?
the relevant working groups have initiated discussions on proposals for the council's conclusions , based on various contributions .
those responsible for development and human rights issues are working together more closely .
the eu's support for election processes around the world is important .
we share the concern that parliament sometimes feels as regards the need togo beyond the elections.
the government then risks losing both legitimacy and political support .
i would like to thank the members of the european parliament for pushing this issue .
europe must therefore assume its role as a soft power .
the ngos can submit projects to it without the support of their government , and that is important .
no .
there is therefore a close relationship between freedom , democracy and human rights .
the partnerships between the european union and third countries cannot ignore this fact .
member states often have very conflicting and differing aspirations .
how can we rid ourselves of these double standards ?
today , during a period of economic crisis , it is particularly important that this dimension is not overlooked .
the eastern partnership is an important instrument for strengthening democracy among our immediate neighbours .
mrs hautala brought up the issue of uzbekistan .
the human rights situation there is far from satisfactory .
as mrs hautala is aware , extending sanctions requires unanimity in the council .
subject women's participation in positions of responsibility in the job market
in the private sector , men account for nine out of ten directors of top european companies .
during 2010 the commission will arrange information activities and the sharing of proven approaches .
the question of quotas for women on the boards of large companies is under discussion .
the issue of gender equality should be a central element in the new strategy .
thank you for the supplementary question .
i chose this career but I have somebody who has chosen to be at home .
part two
the total cost of this project is eur 791 000 .
could you also support nurseries ?
what matters is the quality of the project submitted by the various representatives .
the subject of universities in poland and germany has already been mentioned earlier .
the following is an overview of four of the matters concerned .
olaf is following closely the judicial proceedings in that country .
it involves public procurement procedures .
this ruling , inter alia , sentenced several persons to terms of imprisonment , and imposed fines for forgery .
this is the general picture .
subject cigarette smuggling and revenue
olaf has a clear strategy .
these cigarettes are contributing to that problem but not making any contribution to the cost of treating it .
nowadays , 19 % of young people in europe drop out of school .
so far , only five member states have invested more than 2 % of gdp in research and innovation .
what measures does the commission envisage adopting with this in mind ?
the answer is very clear that people then moved about much more and had much more physical activity .
in this respect , the european union is still waiting for real competences in sport .
you said in your response to mr aylward that volunteering brings clear economic value .
subject white paper on sport
as you probably know , this high level group meets at least three times a year .
in the area of sport , the white paper remains the single most important reference point .
mr president , I would like to thank the commissioner for his response .
the rights of minorities are being flagrantly violated in the eu .
here is an example from italy .
sl thank you for your answer , commissioner .
this is a very specific problem and one that concerns people's lives .
the possibility already exists today for member states to buy up quotas .
the programme would have to be obligatory for it to have any impact at all .
yet I see no majority for that in this parliament or in the council .
if it proves its worth , we will then agree to an extension .
i know that you do not have any more money available to you .
i think that is the challenge .
however , I remain unconvinced by the buy out scheme .
we must do this to protect the industry .
i would add that , with your plan , we will have a milk shortage in the future .
however , I have three questions to ask .
have we learnt any lesson from it ?
looking at the future , what can you promise farmers ?
how and when will this injustice and inequity be eliminated ?
however , such crises recur again and again .
perhaps it will not be dairy next time .
i have more questions for the commissioner .
i stand by that view .
it has my support , although I prefer that we limit this concession until 2013 at the latest .
pl mr president , I hope that the milk producers now have the worst behind them .
i firmly believe this .
we must also recognise , though , that it is the end of the financial year .
de mr president , commissioner , I very much welcome your motion .
we should acknowledge that in this house and push to ensure that they are passed on to farmers .
let us look at the lessons .
production will therefore have to be concentrated still further and milk producers in the most difficult areas forced out .
this is the wrong approach .
for example , some states cannot even produce enough to cover their own consumption .
the president cut off the speaker 
in fact , the farmers want the money to be used for support mechanisms .
is now the time for restrictions on the production of milk or cereals ?
ok , you have chosen your path and followed it consistently .
this was one part of the discussion .
it will be discussed , as you probably know , in the management committee .
i think it would disqualify dairy farmers but of course I have listened to what you say .
then I think there are lots of mistaken ideas going round .
i have clearly said it has to be on the basis of production .
i would like to say that producer organisations are an excellent option . it is actually necessary .
written statements rule 149 
unfortunately , the commission has taken a long time to act .
i welcome the measures proposed by the european commission to help europe's dairy producers .
agenda of the next sitting see minutes
opening of the sitting
the next item is the statements by the council and the commission on preparation of the european council .
mr president , next week , we have a meeting of the european council .
we must , of course , respect the democratic process in the czech republic .
as I said , we will discuss this in more detail this afternoon .
the swedish presidency was also asked by the finance ministers to continue the dialogue with the european parliament .
we have had very good experience of this dialogue and we think that it works well .
a high level of employment is required for sustainable public finances .
in this connection I would also like to remind you of what we said regarding exit strategies .
i would also like to say something about energy security .
we have prepared a report on the progress made since january .
the european council will take note of the report .
we had a very rewarding debate on this during parliament's plenary sitting in september .
it will also be noted that the eu and turkey have resumed talks on migration .
the council will be urged to strengthen frontex and to introduce common rules for frontex operations at sea .
finally , there will also be a debate on external relations .
the decisions it prepares will be taken by the commission or by the council in cfsp matters .
the most important issue in policy terms in the council will be copenhagen .
we need to help developing countries with concrete ideas on finance , as the european commission proposed last month .
the copenhagen agenda is not just about climate change .
institutions alone , however , are not enough .
we can well see that currently , we are in a stalemate .
europe must also do everything it can to create a fair commercial environment .
moderate and polite pressure or maximum pressure ?
this will not be easy to achieve , because the americans have not yet completed their legislative process .
that is absolutely essential .
this applies particularly to america , but it will also be the case in europe .
now I would like to say something about lisbon .
we need a council president who can work with us effectively .
applause 
mr swoboda , could you comment on that ?
it is about a free europe with free citizens whose rights are based on the charter of fundamental rights .
my second point is about the external action service .
i can only call on mr barroso urgently once again to ensure that the commission stays on course .
the financing for this international fund must be transparent .
we have been talking about this for two years , ever since bali .
i have a major problem with the credibility of the swedish presidency of the council .
you should ensure that everything is in order before you go to copenhagen .
colleagues , please keep to the allotted time .
i am not going to take every blue card because we must go ahead with our discussion .
institutional theology is not the priority of the citizens of europe .
those two jobs will hardly help hard pressed small and medium sized businesses in any of our countries .
they will not ease the crisis being borne by millions of families right now .
the banks have , of course , been rescued .
this did not just relate to the social progress clause .
i know that you all hate president klaus because he believes in national democracy .
protests 
but what he is doing here is that he is standing up and defending the czech national interest .
well I have reached the conclusion that I want tony blair .
no , I do not think that it will be possible to stop the train either .
i hope that the train will enter the station very , very soon .
this is extremely important .
people all over the world are expecting us to do so .
how can we ensure success at copenhagen , especially when other partners are not making the same effort ?
so , what do we do in this case ?
that would provide an excuse for the negative elements not to make any effort .
there are also positive aspects .
let us be clear .
the british government has negotiated the treaty .
her majesty the queen has ratified the treaty .
i hope that there is no one in this chamber who hates what he has implied about us .
i welcome the proposals for macro supervision , but they do not go nearly far enough .
therefore , if necessary , the council should make a political declaration .
the european council must make the necessary preparations , but should not jump to any hasty conclusions .
i believe this is the only way of addressing this issue in a calm and responsible way .
the council is going to take the issue of the external action service forward .
there will be an eu us summit on 3 november and the europeans have a special responsibility .
the president cut off the speaker 
i would now like to return to my own topic .
we have had enough of having dictatorships being forced on us , always under the guise of democracy .
however , this solution must be a fair one for all the other member states .
then things rather oddly began to slow down and people started to say that the crisis was over .
actually , the only good thing about this economic crisis is that policy is required to resolve the problems .
as for the new financial architecture , the commission is being quite unambitious about this .
over regulation , however , must not be allowed to prevent growth and employment .
what we need is less navel gazing and more reports of success from the european union .
i listened with great interest to mr barroso's comments earlier .
it subsequently became the lisbon treaty , effectively the same document .
i therefore ask the european council to consider this subject on 29 and 30 november .
more than ten years of debates among the institutions are enough .
these three safeguards are in place , so he has no need to worry .
mr brok , you mentioned 10 years of debates about the lisbon treaty .
president klaus is known for his long standing opposition to the charter , and particularly its social sections .
both the czechs and the sudeten germans have experienced more than enough horror and suffering through war and displacement .
we need to have extra finance .
the council president , the high representative or the commission president ?
the democratic legitimacy of the new service also depends on its composition .
the geographic balance of the union should be taken into account .
so let us deal with the real world .
this facility will provide eur 100 million and could leverage a further eur 500 million of microcredit .
of course , we are all concerned about the czech republic .
this brings me to my third point the economic crisis .
this is what we expect from the european council at the end of the month .
that is a statement in an authorised interview in de volkskrant of 7 october 200what are we going to do ?
sv mr president , minister , commissioner , it is nice to see you here .
this means that pragmatism and results must take precedence .
that would put the stability of our own economy and our own financial markets under threat .
global challenges to europe cannot be solved without efficient common institutions and common policies .
now , the task of the council is to implement it without losing time .
we need a sense of ambition if we are to save the planet .
but also within that generation , the population of the world will have increased by about two billion people .
the union will be more open , more effective and more democratic .
cs mr president , the lisbon treaty is a key issue .
i doubt , however , that the president will end his obstruction .
the crisis indiscriminately hit all the economic systems , both the strong and the less strong .
trust is good , control is even better .
second point climate change .
the european union is rightly at the vanguard of global ecological diplomacy .
more than 50 % of emissions are not yet included in the emissions trading system .
we need more industries to take responsibility in order to achieve our objectives and to guarantee financing .
of course , pharmaceutical legislation is a matter for industry , but it is also a health issue .
the president of the czech republic , václav klaus , is acting within the framework of established rules .
recently we have , from time to time , witnessed intergovernmental drift .
why do we not refer to a structural crisis ?
all of this began with a genuine banking crisis which included the investment banks .
this is one industry , but the entire world economy suffered as a result .
fr mr president , my question is very simple .
a little over a year afterwards , they voted by a two thirds majority in favour .
that is what we are here to do .
many of these issues will be discussed at the summit in ten daystime .
there is still no solution with regard to the czech president .
a few questions have been asked about afghanistan .
therefore , I will certainly return to this issue again .
i know that this afternoon , you will be devoting a specific debate to the external action service .
but I would say that we are facing a real challenge here .
we also need the service to be fully accountable to this house to the european parliament .
another issue raised concerned the administrative burden .
it also builds on the important work done by the stoiber group .
written statements rule 149 
it is easy to understand why .
as prime minister of britain mr blair has shown himself to be a liar and a fantasist .
mr blair brought britain to the edge of ruin .
he could do the same for the eu .
this agreement may , in many respects , inspire the european union to have a more efficient decision making process .
i would like to highlight one example energy security .
mr sassoli , you raised the issue of inadmissibility , under rule 147 of the rules of procedure .
therefore , I would simply ask that amendments 7 , 8 and 9 to the resolution be withdrawn .
i ask you to support this amendment in order to keep your credibility .
the presidency will address this issue in order to unequivocally defend our privileges and immunity .
voting time
the next item is the vote .
it affects and concerns all europeans , whatever the outcome of the vote today .
mr barroso said in response to this that it was an internal matter .
jobbik will not allow such double standards to be applied in parliament .
my first two votes are abstentions from the whole day's votes .
respect for fundamental human rights in all countries in europe is the heart of eu cooperation .
only then can europe gain the confidence of the electorate .
the conservatives in britain say they want to repatriate social and employment policy from the european union .
let me repeat my call for the lisbon treaty to be put to a vote .
pactio olisipiensis censenda est !
in italy , freedom of expression and freedom of the press are clearly at serious risk .
added to this are the attempts to pressurise and manipulate the public television station .
in writing . today we voted on a variety of resolutions and amendments .
we have always been consistent .
they are not interested in freedom of information in europe , but only in italy .
however , have we heard from bulgarian , romanian or french journalists as well ?
how can we be sure that politics in our own countries is not interfering in editorial control and content ?
this unfortunate pattern of behaviour persists .
i regard the debate on the freedom of the press as very important .
the left is free to dislike the italian government .
that , however , does not mean that we should deny that the problem exists at all .
freedom of expression is one of the values forming the basis of democracy .
in view of these considerations , I voted against the motion for a resolution .
we regret that the right wing groups once again refused to ask for a european response to a european problem .
freedom of the press is an absolute requirement .
we must be careful we do not transform our assembly into a court .
however , its representative has not shown himself worthy of it today .
in writing . the issue voted on refers to issues of regulation of media ownership .
rupert murdoch owns almost 200 news outlets throughout the world .
in ireland , we have our own problems with media ownership that we must regulate .
this house must support freedom of speech and freedom of media expression .
it is with regret that colleagues on the right differed .
it would not have been appropriate for this disguised personal attack to have been supported by parliament .
welcome
applause 
it is therefore important that we give the external action service as good a start as possible .
until this time , the presidency will ensure that there is a regular dialogue with the european parliament .
staff will be recruited from the commission , the council secretariat and the member states .
this is clearly laid down in the treaty of lisbon .
this is roughly as far as we have got in the discussions .
firstly , let me mention the status of the eeas .
this should be our objective .
the close involvement of the member states in the new service is one of its key innovations .
this very much meets the wishes expressed in the report .
from the entry into force of the treaty , commission delegations will become eu delegations .
we will learn together .
but we need to look further .
we will be bringing together officials and diplomats from the different institutions and all the member states .
for this , training is essential .
the report raises the promising idea of the creation of a european diplomatic academy .
this report shows that parliament will do the same .
i am sorry to have been a little long , but I think this is such an important matter .
please forgive me , mr president .
it is a very important topic .
actually , institutional creation is not possible without political will .
my response to this attitude is that parliament is important and we must take this into account .
the main thing is to adopt the report now .
i hope that day never comes and I will do my utmost to prevent it .
that is pretty easy democracy , democracy and democracy .
it is never ever based on demos .
that has to act unanimously .
we are well aware that this report is not a definitive report .
therefore , it is only guidelines that are being submitted to our parliament .
the important thing is that the compass , the information , the scope is clear .
my speaking time has run out .
therefore , we have to be very careful and responsible during its setting up .
the budgetary commission is extremely important .
i digress .
the external action service must enable the eu to implement comprehensive , integrated political strategies and campaigns .
we must do away with traditional diplomacy , otherwise this service will bring very little added value .
firstly , we want the new service to have a directorate for peacebuilding and crisis management .
secondly , we want the staff to be given comprehensive education and training .
simply having attended a diplomacy college is not enough .
in fact , quite the opposite is the case .
therefore , we do not share this philosophy .
the wicked lisbon constitution already forces an unelected president and foreign minister on us all .
all other national embassies will become redundant .
in 2008 , only 1 % of the agenda items in the council of foreign ministers were debated publicly .
against precisely this background , the european external action service will also be established .
this must not happen !
we need genuine democratic parliamentary control and we also need genuine transparency .
work in the service should be treated as an integral part of their career at home .
we have failed so far to ensure that our policies are coherent .
i also want to warn against any thoughts about subsuming development policy as part of our foreign policy .
the citizens of europe want europe to speak with one voice .
what will happen to these ministries ?
by the commission , as seems likely , or will the member states be able to appoint their own ?
regarding transparency , I expect a balance to be achieved when establishing the european external action service .
i would also like to emphasise the issue of recruitment .
we in the european parliament must pay attention .
this major reform of the lisbon treaty has to be made to work and will do so .
we , in slovenia , have had a good experience of working in collaboration with austrian diplomats .
mr brok's report also mentions training .
constitutional courts are now debating this issue as well and want to make a decision .
we also hear about europe speaking with one voice .
this does not make us paranoid , as those preaching tolerance are saying .
first of all , we , as the commission , are committed to making the eeas a success .
i can see the need for the high representative vice president to have a degree of managerial and budgetary autonomy .
i support parliament's objectives of ensuring transparent and accountable budgetary arrangements for the eeas .
after the gaza conflict , it was very important to obtain a ceasefire .
finally , on the matter of delegations , as I said before they are open already .
this must also be taken into account .
applause 
parliament's position on equality is therefore clear .
the member states , however , are in a crucial position here .
thank you .
transatlantic judicial and police cooperation .
we will have the first transatlantic economic council with president obama's administration on 26 27 october .
shortly after that , on 3 november , there will be a summit between the eu and the us .
both sides of the atlantic are interested in strengthening our cooperation with regard to development .
the transatlantic economic council is even more important today in light of the financial crisis .
in this regard , I only need remind you of the debate on passenger name records , for example .
an important example is the agreement on airline passenger data .
seminars are being planned to bring the players involved closer together and to help them monitor the implementation .
finally , I would like to mention three more points .
the cooperation and dialogue in this area is continuing and should be stepped up .
my second point relates to critical infrastructure .
there is huge scope for cooperation in this area .
we do this whenever we work together and when we work in international forums such as the united nations .
we also need to coordinate our technical assistance better .
in short , it will provide added value in a policy field , the importance of which is obvious .
a promising area in our transatlantic cooperation is what we call upstream cooperation .
we will discuss policy approaches early on , so that we will avoid divergent regulation down the road .
the needed coherent response to the financial crisis is the best example for it .
the us treasury admits that tax havens result in a yearly tax revenue loss of usd 100 billion .
the second point , which has just been mentioned , is the tax on financial transactions .
once this is done , we will be able to make progress in negotiations .
we must be united in defence of our security .
we must not forget that the north atlantic treaty organisation is the foundation of our transatlantic relations .
has it been confirmed ?
the decision to create the transatlantic economic council two years ago was the right one .
now it is a question of agreeing on a specific agenda for the tec which reflects these priorities .
three quick points .
it is actually a major opener .
lastly , it is disappointing that we have no study and no road map as promised by mr verheugen .
the transatlantic market has a trade volume of around eur 2 billion per day .
this makes it obvious how important the world trade organisation wto is .
i am hoping for good results in this respect next week .
however , the recent nobel peace prize that has just been awarded to him places him under pressure .
i am concerned for instance about the conflicting messages coming out of the us administration regarding russia .
naturally , economic and commercial trade between the united states and europe is important for jobs and for businesses .
it is a very small operation , as we know .
pl madam president , I would like to thank you for giving me the floor .
the second area is security .
the united states and europe could do a lot more together in both these areas .
it is not the case that the us and the european union agree on every area .
i am very pleased that the american administration is showing such a desire to deepen and develop our relations .
the economic partnership is a particularly important forum for us .
this was clearly stated in the tec framework agreement of 30 april 200it would be important in guiding future work for the tec .
a very brief word on swift and some gls questions that have been mentioned .
the swift agreement is needed as it sets out specific safeguards on data .
a last answer on terrorism .
we will therefore also cooperate on how to prevent radicalism , including misuse of the internet .
you can see that there is an enormous range of issues .
i have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with rule 110 2 .
the eu us summit in november will strengthen the transatlantic partnership and promote dialogue between the two great powers .
the european union and united states must adopt a vital role in combating climate change .
the role of legislators in this relationship will be important .
the european union and the united states have a strategic role to play in the recovery process .
the opportunities and perspectives of nanotechnologies are also a relevant subject .
in october 2008 , the eu and cuba agreed on the resumption of a comprehensive political dialogue .
de madam president , I would like to thank mrs malmström for her excellent , detailed answer .
i would like to ask for your advice .
unfortunately , there has been very little progress so far .
subject elder abuse
this proposal contains many elements that are relevant to the abuse of elderly people .
unanimity in the council is required for the proposal to be approved .
it is the first time I have heard about this .
sweden has a long tradition in social policy .
that would help enormously in improving the quality of life and ensuring more respect for the elderly .
no one , apparently , has left this prison alive .
he is being held in prison without trial and without charges .
i also know that mrs malmström is extremely committed to this matter .
he is not an easy person to deal with and abuse in eritrea is widespread .
the third event was the global expert meeting on alcohol , health and social development held on 23 september .
a lot has happened since the swedish presidency proposed an alcohol strategy for the eu in 200the alcohol strategy was adopted in 2006 and a lot has happened since then .
i am very pleased about this .
the main cause is alcohol .
subject environmental aspect of gas pipelines
nord stream is a unique project for the baltic sea area on account of its size and possible consequences .
the council would nevertheless like to stress that the nord stream project is a private undertaking .
lt thank you minister , for your truly comprehensive answer .
i can guarantee , honourable members , that sweden is doing that .
we must not make any political or economic judgments .
to remove those barriers means protecting migrant workers on the same basis as nationals .
the council emphasised the strong elements of differentiation and flexibility in the rules on the free movement of workers .
we have mechanisms in place for the regular review of the transitional rules together with the commission .
the reasons for this are clear .
all eu member states have , of course , been badly affected by the economic crises and unemployment .
what measures will it take against turkey ?
yes , the council is aware of the incidents that the member refers to .
the honourable member is , of course , aware of this .
that is very positive .
subject revision of regulation ec no 1 / 2005
is the presidency sensitive to all aspects of the potential impact of the revision ?
thank you for your question .
please let science dictate .
state of play as regards sis ii and vis motions for resolutions tabled see minutes
opening of the sitting
the problem is not new .
once developed , the vaccine is only just enough to protect the populations of the industrialised countries .
tuberculosis is a good example of the contrast between us and our neighbours in the developing world .
this has led to a situation in europe where tb is not the persistent threat is once was .
everybody complains about it .
something has to be done .
we must make sure that we put these vaccines in the hands of countries that need them most .
the list is endless , yet we watch and do nothing about this problem .
it is an honour to work for the institution of which you are currently the vice president .
on the other hand , the new authorities in the republic of moldova are facing enormous difficulties .
representatives of the imf are currently in chişinău , and we await their report with interest .
i must also mention that the republic of moldova is eligible for both grants and loans .
the commission remains available to continually offer the authorities in chişinău specialist consultancy in this area .
we are optimistic about this as the new government has reaffirmed its support for this principle in its programme .
this action is part of our constant wider efforts aimed at resolving the conflict .
ladies and gentlemen , the republic of moldova is at a crossroads , both politically and economically .
we must admire those who achieved this victory almost single handedly by successfully gaining the trust of moldova's citizens .
i strongly believe that moldova will receive assistance from a number of quarters .
russia maintains that moldova , as a former soviet republic , is in its sphere of influence .
such concepts are outdated .
moldova , as a manifestly sovereign and european country , could one day join nato and even the eu .
we are given too little time to assess such complex issues .
on a final note , moldova's citizens require visas .
moldova is currently in the most difficult economic situation among all the states on our continent .
they have now become a possibility and we hope that they will be conducted at the fastest rate possible .
however , the parliament in chişinău is in a difficult position .
romania and the republic of moldova have particularly close economic relations .
with this in mind , an imf mission may visit chişinău in the near future .
almost all post soviet system states firstly require a certain amount of financial support .
these gates need to be held open with financial aid .
we desperately need to provide immediate and urgent assistance .
an imf delegation is currently in chişinău .
this community assistance has brought and will continue to bring specific benefits to the population .
this country is the largest per capita beneficiary of community assistance after the palestinian territories .
we are therefore in negotiations on this issue .
written statements rule 149 
the republic of moldova's path towards democracy has been difficult and it has now turned towards europe .
i therefore request my speaking time in accordance with what had been arranged until the last minute .
i request the floor after mr kasoulides .
consequently , I will not go into detail on its results .
both georgia and russia are criticised for their actions .
we will continue to undertake every effort to promote constructive discussions which will lead to concrete results .
the need for economic and political reforms in this country is greater than ever .
all our diplomatic and other actions should never encourage udis or separatisms .
this is a very important moment .
another thing is to ask what the eu will do now .
we fully back the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia as an independent state .
both ethnic georgians and other inhabitants are suffering in these areas at present .
i do not share this conclusion .
there is no one truth , there are several truths and they often contradict each other .
this is essential to resolving this situation .
we will also continue to provide assistance to displaced persons .
the debate is closed .
i shall vote against amendments 727 , 732 and 734 , tabled by mr deva and mr szymański .
they often risk a great deal , even their lives .
applause 
amendment 832 should , therefore , be adjusted accordingly .
13 03 16 erdf convergence
i ask you , as the most knowledgeable , to say a few words on this matter .
we have a practice and a custom .
on the one hand , there would be an increase , and on the other hand , a decrease .
we would indeed like assistance , but we have to know what is available .
the proposal here is to vote on amendment 812 first , that is the proposal .
rapporteur . mr president , again , the order of vote is not my decision .
any change will result in confusion and later on will produce a lot of difficulties .
we have a definitive voting procedure in place .
i ask the rapporteur to take the floor .
some of us have been hearing different numbers being called .
so that we avoid any misunderstandings , can we pay attention to the screen up here ?
i am not blaming anyone , but let us be clear and watch the screen .
ok .
it may be that I am reading the numbers too fast .
before the vote on amendment 937 
i fully understand that , and so does the house .
draft general budget 2010 section iii 
democracy building in external relations vote 
the institutional aspects of setting up the european external action service 
mr president , we could vote en bloc .
explanations of vote
we are spending twice that simply on this one item of our gross contributions to the eu budget .
it is said that 35 million girls have been disposed of in this way .
it is a scandal !
100 % of our market had to be .
not all eu states have the same possibilities when it comes to financing this measure .
i have therefore abstained from the vote .
why the commission's belated response ?
let us not forget that belated intervention is far less effective , and ends up costing more .
it is our duty to our hard working farmers .
thank you , mr siekierski .
mr seán kelly has the floor .
half a loaf is better than no bread at all .
and then , back in the real world , what is the european union doing ?
now you look at what the eu is doing .
but there is one thing that we should remember .
thus , do european policies go from being unthinkable to inevitable without any intervening stage ?
we do not need to have a strategic eu us partnership .
it is about time we went back to our principle of open trade to stimulate the world economy .
amendment 886 has a commendable purpose investment in sport .
indeed , the eur 600 million fund would have provided real support for the member states facing this crisis .
therefore , conservatives have voted to decrease many areas of eu spending .
in areas such as communication policy , this cost benefit analysis is important to ensure better results and resource management .
these proposals are an acknowledgment of the failure of the commission's policy for the dairy farming sector .
in writing . dairy farmers are under serious pressure right now .
this is not a sustainable situation for one of europe's key industries .
eur 300 million is better than nothing but more drastic action is needed in future to support this industry .
the crisis in the dairy industry has brought numerous farmers to the brink of bankruptcy .
the intervention period for milk powder and butter is to be extended and export refunds are to be increased .
these measures should stabilise milk prices in the medium term .
however , this is little more than a drop in the ocean .
i would point out that these are only foundations that have been laid .
our trustworthiness in the eyes of our citizens depends on major projects such as these .
a united europe cannot afford further delays and negligence .
to do so , it must increase the number of agreements with developing countries .

following the death of president conté , a military junta seized power .
therefore I shall not go back over my speech .
my fellow members have already made a number of points .
i would like to thank the french government for suspending military cooperation with guinea .
however , three weeks have passed since the massacre , and these actions have yielded no visible results .
only then will we be able to talk about the handover of power by captain camara .
that is why I appeal to the european commission to act .
personally , I cannot understand how , as a politician , anyone could think in that way .
this is the biggest massacre since guinea's independence in 195gangs of soldiers are regularly involved in attacks , robbery and rape .
it was an unprecedented violation of the guinean civilian population that was carried out on 28 september .
condemning the events is clearly not enough .
this is a fast growing phenomenon in many armed conflict zones .
that is why the epp is hesitant to support this suggestion .
substantial mineral and oil resources could make guinea one of africa's most prosperous nations .
fi mr president , recently a finnish voter asked me how I would define human rights .
guinea is a signatory to the cotonou agreement , which requires human rights and democracy to be respected .
i also wish to mention a point that was emphasised before .
thank you .
the vote will take place after the debates .
mr president , iran is characterised by linguistic , religious , ethnic and political diversity .
one way is with the european instrument for democracy and human rights .
so she had actually been excused the death penalty but was subsequently hanged .
but we follow a policy of appeasement in the eu .
we need to take tough sanctions .
four death sentences in particular are mentioned in the motion for a resolution before us .
iran is the only country which was still executing minors at the time of the offence .
the iraqi government should stop following the orders of the mullahs in tehran .
it is our moral duty .
the answer is two things in particular .
since the elections , the general human rights situation has become even worse .
secondly , freedom of religion and opinion are in a sorry state .
three people arrested during the demonstrations against the outcome of the presidential election have now been sentenced to death .
i appeal to the european commission .
a month ago , we debated the murder of journalists .
the catch the eye procedure is closed .
the trials against those involved in these activities are continuing .
the vote will take place after the debates .
their processing needs to take place with all urgency , and the international community should be invited to help .
the 25 year civil war in sri lanka appears to be over .
critical articles should stop being punished with prison sentences .
applause 
the rajapaksa government is , in fact , a dictatorship with a very thin democratic veneer .
i welcome the opportunity through this resolution to condemn it .
we must now demand that the representatives of all the delegated un bodies be allowed into these camps .
to abolish the causes of violence , that is the real task .
sri lanka has still not joined the ottawa convention banning anti personnel mines .
the citizens of sri lanka deserve true democracy and a decent life .
the living conditions are appalling .
the relentless terrorist campaign waged by the tamil tigers severely blighted the development of that beautiful country .
now the country has entered a hopeful , though critical , phase .
aid should also definitely extend to additional sums allocated by the commission for mine clearance .
the european commission recently concluded an in depth investigation into the state of human rights in sri lanka .
thank you .
guinea vote 
thank you , commissioner orban .
composition of committees see minutes
applause 
adjournment of the session
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .
it did not happen .
history , of course , did not end .
after that , the union genuinely opened its doors to the new democracies of central and eastern europe .
from time to time , there are various difficulties with these countries .
the chosen approach was therefore the most natural in historical terms and the most expedient in practical terms .
we will also be helping ourselves .
i like to say , somewhat poetically , that europe is the homeland of our homelands .
technical and economic developments alone make this an absolute necessity .
the gradual and peaceful grouping together of states will also strengthen peaceful coexistence of course .
how better to tame the various nationalist demons than through practical cooperation between nations ?
are we not in brussels too , however ?
this , too , has to be patiently confronted .
the exporting of these values was often accompanied by violence .
it is simply something new .
if only this attempt could be an example to others !
it is a movement that is perhaps slowly getting under way already .
the european union should remember this too and be clear as to its external boundaries .
if it wants to tear down a boundary , it must first know where the boundary lies .
the european parliament must not appear to anyone to be merely an expensive adornment of the union .
let us therefore do everything possible to ensure that they are not forgotten .
order of business
wednesday 
there is no joint proposal for this election .
sl I am very much in favour of keeping the agenda unchanged .
the sitting was suspended at 16.05 and resumed at 16.15 
we were in constant contact with prague and other capitals .
our unity gave us the credibility to encourage others .
we were able to present our commitments .
both of these are strong reasons why we should not withdraw supporting measures until we have secured our recovery .
at the european council , we made significant progress on strengthening financial supervision .
the presidency will now begin to discuss the proposals with this parliament .
with all this in place and on its way , we must focus on safeguarding jobs .
i told you that handling the economic and financial crisis was one of our most important tasks .
we also discussed justice and home affairs .
they were , of course , an important element of the discussions .
nevertheless , you and I know that much remains to be done .
i look forward to continuing our close cooperation with this parliament on many of the important issues .
the copenhagen meeting is actually now only 25 days away .
we all know these are difficult issues .
when there is so much at stake , the road will never be easy .
we got the approval of the numbers the commission proposed , accompanied by strong conditionality .
it is equally clear other partners must show that they can match the seriousness of our intent .
so what are the prospects for copenhagen ?
and we should continue to fight on for final agreement to a treaty a binding treaty .
the swedish presidency has done very remarkable work in bringing this final consensus to the european council .
the focus is , of course , very much on the filling of the new posts .
the delays due to the treaty have given us a common challenge .
we must not delay the arrival of a new commission , but we cannot short cut the hearings .
we need to have the spirit of 198if we show the same dedication and commitment , I am sure we will succeed .
this obligation concerns , first and foremost , the economic recovery and employment .
we now need to take decisions with regard to people .
i am not just saying this on account of mrs malmström and mrs wallström , who are sitting here .
is that the image that represents europe to its people today ?
the president of parliament has already mentioned this .
you mentioned the high representative .
there is also the debate about the financial transactions tax .
we need to send out clear signals in this regard .
nothing else is really being done transparently , I must say !
and , finally , we must have someone who believes in a powerful european external action service .
those are the three key elements that characterise this figure .
it is the community method that the president of the council must defend .
climate protection and economic development are actually two sides of the same coin .
mr president , the treaty of lisbon has been ratified by all 27 member states .
i mention this specifically in view of our celebratory sitting today and václav havel's speech .
we have done this up to now , and we will continue to do so .
so somebody should tell tony blair not to get too upset if he does not get it !
members here have celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and rightly so .
but now we have a new berlin wall , not on the frontiers of nations but within nations .
it is a bit too late to be asking for transparency now , mr verhofstadt .
germany and austria are a poor example in this regard , but so , unfortunately , are others .
there are qualified people sitting in this chamber , but they have no chance of being accepted .
it is a much lengthier process than anyone could foresee .
to say the obvious , it is not that we are not trying to find the best possible balance .
that is what we have been trying to do .
fr with regard to the institutional question , let us be totally honest with ourselves .
most of us have fought hard to have this treaty , over many years , at least nine years !
if we do not have institutions that work , what will happen ?
why must the president of the council be a prime minister ?
in my view , this is an anticlimax .
would it have been possible to decide that the eu would not make a reasonable contribution ?
his position is badly designed from a democratic point of view .
the issue of the nominations is very important .
welcome
that must be the case for the president of the european council , too .
only the president of the commission has full legitimacy .
even the most perfect treaty could not , by itself , solve many of the problems .
without a free and vigilant media , the public would be completely unaware of the choice of eu leaders .
all the same , we try to guide others outside the eu on the importance of democratic elections .
yet my scepticism about this project is undiminished .
my fellow members cannot fail to share my opinion .
unlike them , I am pleased that the external service is to remain outside the commission .
besides , herman van rompuy does not actually govern as prime minister .
any form of opt out weakens the community .
we need a president of the council who is capable of guaranteeing consistency and continuity .
the second challenge is that of green growth .
companies are finding it difficult to obtain financial assistance and bank loans , while unemployment is on the rise .
this is also mentioned in this document .
the methods we have for coordinating social policy , based on an open approach , are fairly ineffective .
it is our shared responsibility to highlight this fact .
precisely the same thing happened when we negotiated the climate targets .
it is exactly the same with the climate package .
however , the two degree target is extremely important and therefore we must now push forward with full commitment .
it must take a real initiative in copenhagen .
europe needs a louder voice that is more united and stronger .
only such policies can prevent schröder putin deals from ever being repeated .
václav havel told us today that europe is a homeland of our homelands .
based upon this understanding , I think we can succeed in the implementation of the lisbon treaty .
vaira vīķe freiberga is a staunch european citizen .
she is a highly educated and powerful figure who thoroughly understands the challenges of europe's future .
lastly , on strong institutions , mr barroso is absolutely right .
the conditions ought to relate , in particular , to the mandatory legal nature of the future agreement .
we cannot allow the union to be represented continually only by the faces of men .
however , we must also ask what price we have paid to achieve this .
the price we have paid was actually that we have undermined our values and let pragmatism triumph over values .
you know what I am referring to here .
in my view , what the european union did is unacceptable from a legal , political and moral perspective .
the european union will attend the copenhagen conference as the leader in the battle against climate change .
whether we like it or not , unsolved problems affecting these indigenous communities are present within the european union .
pl madam president , adoption of the long awaited lisbon treaty is now behind us .
the most important task today for the eu and its member states is to resolve economic and social problems .
i think we should also look at the title .
well done on what you have done so far .
the fall of the wall marked the start of the real europe .
that would , of course , require the consent of all 27 countries .
it is too premature to speculate about the names yet .
but there are , as the prime minister said , only two posts to be created .
the swedish presidency , the commission and many others work day and night .
i deplore it , but it is a fact .
we have confirmed the commission's estimates and are backing them .
there will be a global distribution key based on emissions and the ability to pay .
that is how these things link in , just as mr barnier said earlier .
the debate is closed .
eastern european countries are in the latter situation .
consequently , any discontinuation of this financial support will disrupt the anti crisis programme which romania has launched .
copenhagen or no copenhagen , climate change will be with us for decades to come .
equally , we need to choose the top leaders as soon as possible , and not to waste time .
this is why european institutions must promote new dynamic labour market policies as soon as possible .
however , thisfootnotewill not enter into force until iceland or croatia ratifies the treaty .
at the time , the european parliament did not allow the commission to be compromised in this way .
i trust parliament will not have to intervene again .
it is time for women !
it is a good opportunity for the eu to evaluate relations between ourselves and russia .
we have a lot to gain from cooperation with russia in all areas .
we will also express our disappointment over russia's recent withdrawal from the energy charter treaty .
we hope that a stronger early warning mechanism will be established and approved at the summit .
we must also regain the necessary trust with regard to akhalgori , upper kodori and the checkpoint in perevi .
the summit will also allow us to raise a number of international and regional issues .
it is crucial , too , that russia does not succumb to the temptations of protectionism .
clearly , we believe that the best way forward is to work together in a rules based multilateral format .
the summit will be an opportunity to again stress the importance of russia's wto accession .
these should therefore form the basis of our work on energy security under the new eu russia agreement .
we hope that the conditions will soon be in place for visa free travel between the eu and russia .
in the caucasus , we must jointly demand unrestricted access for eu observers .
we must look together with russia to a new global security arrangement or agreement .
i think that the medvedev initiative should not be immediately rejected .
others think that there is no agenda and it is a mere test of our reactions .
we have to see what is still valid and we have to add something new to them .
this includes the involvement of russia in international regulatory frameworks like the wto and the energy charter .
if the russian delegation has a similar recommendation , the summit is doomed to failure .
it was russia , nonetheless , that rescued the kyoto protocol , while the us refused to ratify it .
the situation is definitely not ideal .
hu while on the subject of eu russian relations , I must also mention today's formal sitting .
hungarians were among the greatest victims of this dictatorship .
the european union speaks out against human rights violations .
it is indeed right to do so .
our russian partners do this in an accomplished manner , without ambiguity , because ambiguity causes misunderstandings .
i have two brief points to make .
secondly , I would like to stress the importance of persuading russia to commit to international rules .
please take along the results of the human rights dialogue and , furthermore , do it very publicly .
pl madam president , the eu russia summit takes place in a week's time .
critical journalists are intimidated , persecuted and murdered .
yet it does not stop there .
what do you actually intend to do about the negative developments in the relationship between russia and the eu ?
turkey denies its armenian holocaust .
the usa flattens iraq and this place fawns on them .
we must continue to work on the other three spaces as well .
russia must cooperate with the european union in this region of maximum interest .
however , this is currently being restricted by an historical debate between several eu member states and russia .
we are mutually dependent in the energy sector , as was also mentioned by hannes swoboda .
however , this does not mean , as other members have suggested , us abandoning our fundamental values .
i have no time for that kind of talk .
pl madam president , I would like , above all , to say something to mrs ferrero waldner .
however , it is a valuable opportunity to meet and to talk .
they have always been mentioned at the many summits I have been on .
this is what we are aiming for , particularly in our new agreement .
these are always discussed in our eu russia human rights consultations .
the debate is closed .
in this context , the alternative to russian gas , the nabucco project , becomes an absolute necessity .
what we are talking about is the shared interest in ensuring an alternative source of gas .
at present , both the issue of energy transit and market accessibility are fraught with contradictions .
next week , our european leaders during the summit need to speak about more than pipelines and free trade .
the next item is the debate on
this is a very wide ranging directive .
it has many new features .
the transposition of this , in a consistent and full way , is absolutely vital for its effective operation .
otherwise , those barriers will remain .
that is going to be a vital part that starts , and we are following that with great interest .
we would like to hear tonight how the commission is proposing to approach that process .
we want to see that list .
i think it is important to understand , however , the perspective of my committee .
next week , the swedish presidency is holding a ministerial meeting in malmö on precisely the subject of e governance .
political support for this is , of course , very important .
what are the biggest challenges , then ?
this dialogue has been a key element .
this was already mentioned .
but the commission cannot carry out the implementation at national level .
some member states might be late .
these will , again , not be totally perfect , but they should form a solid basis .
i remain convinced , however , that the glass is more than half full .
but we had better keep filling it and quickly .
i would like to come to my last point .
anything else would not be sufficient .
we are doing this in the name of equal opportunities and protection of the principle of healthy competition .
the services directive is a good example .
we must increase our citizensinterest in the functioning of and responsibility for the market .
are there any new ideas on this matter ?
generally speaking , there is little knowledge as regards the current laws on the four freedoms .
we are doing this , for example , by subsidising the motor industry .
we are talking about such occupations as hairdressers , plumbers and bricklayers , who do not need subsidies .
why ?
commissioner , let us agree also to name the 50 % of member states which do implement the legislation .
so , what has been proposed today is something I support 100 % .
president in office of the council . mr president , thank you again for raising this very important issue .
there might be some delays .
a question was asked about how the contact points would function .
many member states are also making their own efforts in order to spread information about the directive .
the services directive does not cover labour law and the posting of workers is excluded from it .
we are looking into that , and it is a little outside this debate .
the commission will still be watching this very closely .
of course , this also depends on the willingness of a member state to simplify laws and procedures .
so we have been very active on that .
i would like to say that very clearly .
proper implementation is therefore the most pressing issue , especially in the current difficult economic crisis .
france and belgium are applying a similar regulation with regard to romania and bulgaria .
greater use of the single market has become possible .
the effects which have been achieved are an encouragement to continue work on the further liberalisation of this directive .
the author , herbert reul , has indicated that he is running late .
if he arrives , he may be given the floor at the end .
health research is even more fragmented at european level , and the number of public private partnerships must be increased .
research today shows that there are already initiatives aimed at pre diagnosis .
i know that the european parliament gives high priority to the fight against alzheimer's disease .
this is a problem which has a number of different aspects to it .
parliament must be involved in all initiatives relating to future joint programming in the field of research .
i think this motion is a good one .
is the joint programming initiative enough ?
madam president , in my constituency of northern ireland , we currently have 16 000 people suffering from dementia .
in the united kingdom , we currently have just over 400 000 people suffering from alzheimer's .
it was said then that the eu should take action in this matter .
what are you there for ?
finally , it is up to us to control the budget for this issue .
the importance of this has already been stated by several speakers .
it is regrettable that this resolution had to be prepared at the last minute .
madam president , alzheimer's and other dementia related diseases are dreadful .
what coordination mechanisms is the commission proposing that could not have been implemented before the communication ?
the illness also involves the suffering of close relatives .
this is important if even better use is to be made of the limited resources for research .
however , prevention is also important alongside providing the best possible care for those affected .
one minute speeches on matters of political importance
the reasons behind this are not only electoral .
pt last month , the regions of europe were in the spotlight .
global challenges and european responses represent a perfect opportunity for a new strategy for the outermost regions .
the president cut off the speaker 
we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , that wall of shame .
however , for one fallen wall , how many others have been erected on our continent ?
today we are quite able to make a realistic assessment of events in russia .
but it gets worse .
in order to achieve this , we need to increase plant cover .
firstly , what is the relationship between the risks and benefits ?
i therefore think that more harmonisation may be required .
the cross is a symbol both of the christian religion and of the history and tradition of europe .
removal of the cross by administrators is the first step to the culturalharakiriof europe .
unfortunately , pragmatism of this kind is turning into a consistent plan to combat european values .
large companies continue to announce that they are scaling back their activities and cutting jobs .
madam president , I was due to talk about the pressures unlimited eu migration is putting on the uk .
i will tell you .
however , they have brought back the most hideous aspects , brutality and terror .
is it true that this proposition means a substantial reduction in regional funds ?
does the european commission realise that this will radically weaken eu regional and agricultural policy ?
sadly , the consequences of these crimes are devastating and long lasting .
in view of this , I would like to ask if such a request has been received .
does the european commission intend to make the european union pay this debt ?
just this week , yet another serious work related accident killed five portuguese workers in andorra .
there was confusion there in assigning the microphone .
pl madam president , I would like to draw attention to the health situation in ukraine .
what is this coordination like ?
pt the current economic crisis leads to job insecurity .
the european union's regional policy is one of the most useful policies for our fellow citizens .
it is time we spent money for europe more effectively .
that is also the core idea that has guided us throughout the preparation of the report .
we are going to follow the same method for albania and bosnia and herzegovina .
there you have it , madam president .
it is to give visa free travel to all the people of the western balkans .
i would like to conclude by thanking mrs fajon , the rapporteur .
with all respect to my distinguished colleagues , I have to denounce a non constructive attitude .
the task for our rapporteur was to make a breakthrough on visa liberalisation while taking the house with her .
she has done this in the form of the declaration that she negotiated with the council .
i would prefer it to be sooner .
i would like to make one thing clear .
i would like to know what you think about this .
the president cut off the speaker 
we know that the eu cannot achieve this alone , as the national governments need to agree to it .
we need to overcome the anxieties in our population .
how wonderful !
however , we must not forget kosovo .
it cannot do it alone .
now we have to use it to deal with the western balkans .
criteria are criteria , and these requirements need to be met in order to qualify for the visa waiver .
what their free travel in the eu amounts to is a step towards fully fledged membership of the eu .
this responsibility also means action at the same time .
we cannot , however , allow our eastern neighbours to be isolated .
i obviously welcome this openness .
we are talking about moldova , a country which has made considerable progress on the political front .
but this is a political house , and we all do serious politics as best we can .
we are talking about the destiny of the young generation .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 149 
the issue of providing visa free travel is only partially a technical one .
medium term financial assistance for member statesbalances of payments and social conditionality debate 
latvia was at risk of going bankrupt without financial assistance from outside .
it was clear from the very beginning that such unselective cuts would hit the most vulnerable in society .
i would be pleased if you can inform us about whether that is the case .
i do not believe that it is a case of accusing the commission of mismanaging latvian policy .
we have been asked to trust member states .
stable , strong social support systems cannot be maintained if the member states do not have strong economies .
complex solutions must be found that will foster the economic development of all the european union member states .
people have the smallest reserves then in these countries .
unemployment is rising due to economic problems developing unilaterally and social expenditure is also decreasing .
surely the commission should be insisting that all member states should at least seek to do that .
that is the problem .
what is our alternative , then , as representatives of european citizens ?
this does not mean , however , that better political and social coordination is not required .
on the contrary , this integration is vital .
job losses are the main concern of european citizens .
both parties welcomed our mission and expressed their readiness to engage in mutual dialogue .
internal dialogue did take place later on , but has , regrettably , not yet produced a final outcome .
i still , however , believe that we should continue to push for a political agreement in this country .
honduras is one of the central american countries with which the european union wishes to conclude an association agreement .
here , we are all democrats and , therefore , fighters for freedom .
there are no right wing or left wing coup leaders or dictators , merely repressive and freedom destroying ones .
what has happened , though ?
now more than ever europe must take a firm stance on democracy .
we reject any agreement with an illegal government .
the european union must demand the unconditional and immediate reinstatement of president zelaya .
they were decisive , specific and very important .
i am sure that we want this to happen .
the elections can be decisive and positive for a democratic honduras .
the current situation in honduras is temporary , and cannot last long .
i condemn this military coup in the strongest terms .
mr president , presidential elections in honduras were called 16 months ago .
the agreement contained a set of key points supported by both sides .
i am grateful to the commission for taking precisely this position .
as I said , this is a poor country .
made in origin marking debate 
i particularly recall your resolution of july 2006 and the written declaration of september 200origin marking should therefore be considered in that spirit .
that is precisely what this regulation is about .
since 2006 , discussions have been held in council in order to reach an agreement on the commission proposal .
they are worried that the administrative burden and the costs of an origin marking scheme may outweigh the benefits .
i sincerely hope this will clear the way for a compromise solution .
at the same time , tens of thousands of jobs are disappearing .
however , new technical barriers to trade do not protect european industry .
could the commissioner perhaps address that point for me please ?
but I do make my commitment to carry on with this , because there is a strength of feeling .
i will come on to what I think and why I think that is so important .
well , it is subject to further discussion there is not a final list at all .
mr arif said that we should not water this down .
of course but I am not trying to water down I am trying to be realistic .
it is about the level playing field .
it is about saying that we need to move forward .
there was a concern that that would be expensive .
it was not what was being looked for and so we have not pursued that .
the debate is closed .
defending each country's right to sustainable production is a future requirement .
closure of the sitting
opening of the sitting
i enjoy an excellent working relationship with the committee .
they must also act consistently and in good faith .
i can only use the power of persuasion to convince eu institutions and bodies to follow my recommendations .
in addition , a new six page overview has been produced .
eight cases closed in 2008 exemplify best practice among the institutions and bodies in responding to issues I raised .
as a result , the company concerned received more than eur 100 000 in outstanding payments .
this network now consists of roughly 95 offices in 32 countries and includes the committee on petitions .
one of its purposes is to facilitate the rapid transfer of complaints to the competent body .
a very important initiative in this area came to fruition earlier this year .
so far this year , over 23 000 people have used the guide to obtain advice .
this allegation arose in 36 % of all inquiries and included refusal of information or documents .
we can all be proud of the result , which is the new statute .
recently , we have seen some difficulties in relation to competition files .
my last point is about communication in practice .
just like the annual report , it is thorough , complete and user friendly .
it enhances visibility and citizens can easily find the ombudsman's guide in a couple of clicks .
the fact remains that the commission is the guardian of the treaties .
coming back to the report , the committee on petitions approved it by a large majority on 1 october .
our ombudsman has carried out his job of examining and processing the complaints in an active and balanced way .
moreover , the ombudsman serves as a resource for the institutions .
that says a lot and the matter needs to be addressed .
that will depend on resources more than anything .
there is not much time , so I will restrict myself to just three points .
we might say that a number of politicians in our parliament could learn from you .
355 complaints a 6 % increase on the previous year is very little .
it is very little in the context of the 500 million people living in europe .
that has already been said .
many thanks , mr diamandouros , for your work with our fellow citizens .
many thanks to your team .
congratulations mr diamandouros .
thousands of students are demonstrating , they are taking to the streets and occupying lecture theatres .
it is the way in which enlightened people communicate with one another and articulate themselves .
the service is improving year on year .
maybe it sounds like I am taking the high moral ground I am not .
the first problem is information .
the second problem is costs .
it is therefore necessary to consider whether the taxpayersmoney invested has brought the desired results .
the third problem is subsidiarity .
consequently , recourse to the european ombudsman gives european citizens the facility to enforce respect for their rights .
hu I , too , would like to thank the european ombudsman for his work .
hu the european ombudsman has done an outstanding job .
this sentiment has also been echoed by the committee on petitions , and I support his re election .
in this respect , there are two different messages being given , making the european union two faced .
bulgaria actively participates in this network .
it presents certain challenges .
that is certainly the case .
there are two points here .
we handle more than 11 000 requests for information in addition to complaints each year .
this very area is one that the treaty of lisbon could have tackled .
the beneš decrees absolutely cannot legitimise injustice .
we are expecting definite intervention from the eu .
however , I view with concern the fact that the number of complaints rose in comparison with 200fortunately , this was by only 6 % , but it should be a warning to our institutions .
transitional procedural guidelines on budgetary matters in view of the entry into force of the lisbon treaty debate 
the rapporteur has identified the right issues to be discussed in his report .
we will need a timetable that will allow an adequate involvement of all actors .
this will take time .
moreover , national parliaments also have such an instrument .
we should not do away with the possibility of transfers between accounts , either .
all the institutions agreed that this would be the case so as to avoid any legal vacuum .
we should therefore have no need for transitional guidelines on budgetary matters .
in that sense , parliament resembles an anti parliament .
the pvv finds it disgraceful that this dreadful treaty has been rammed down the throats of the dutch people .
the pvv cooperates constructively in this house .
yet we cannot go along with the present report .
with this hope , I ask everyone to support this proposal .
we do not believe that there is anything more to be added to its conclusions .
in this report , you welcome the existence of the treaty of lisbon .
so you have admitted it .
this is especially important from the point of view of the beneficiaries of the eu budget .
the idea is that everyone can watch these films in the european union .
this is a fine initiative .
it is a citizensinitiative , which seeks to promote european values and european film makers .
it is your turn you still have a week , next week , in which to vote .
i am counting on you .
i would now like to read the text of the declaration .
mrs corazza bildt , I fully understand what you are saying .
thus , it has a right to be here it does not need to be invited .
i will read the text out in english .
in striving for new signatures , we should ask our honourable partner to be more serious in the future .
a word is missing there .
nobody really thinks that the army of south ossetia was bombing gori and approaching tbilisi .
that is why president sarkozy flew to meet president medvedev and not president kokoity .
the european ombudman's activities 2008 
voting time
explanations of vote
in my delegation's view , kosovo cannot be put on the same footing as the western balkan countries .
it is important to move forward , to create more favourable conditions to simplify the visa regime .
there remains the unsolved question of kosovo and albania .
at the same time , the unacceptable agreements for the repatriation of persons resident without authorisation are maintained .
and it is more unacceptable still to demand that kosovo be included in it !
i fully back the amendment tabled on behalf of my own group .
although I voted in favour of this report , I believe this process needs to be monitored carefully .
in addition , under no circumstances can we accept requirements for biometric data for the issue of visas .
the inclusion of bosnia and herzegovina and albania , however , is something to be rejected .
reallocating sums from progress would send out the wrong signal , since progress targets the most vulnerable social groups .
the european microfinance facility needs to have a separate budget line .
there are , however , certain areas that require reinforcement .
at the time , however , your disapproval was so much more discreet when it existed !
we also reject any form of usa russia eu nato collaboration in constructing a missile defence system .
i therefore voted against this motion for a resolution .
there are certainly deficits in terms of democracy and the rule of law in russia .
in the light of these considerations I voted against the motion for a resolution on the eu russia summit .
in writing . relations between the eu and russia are clearly more than just about trade .
the assassination of maksharip aushev highlights the brutality that unfortunately meets protest .
negotiations , which began last year , are currently underway with russia .
it is for this reason that I have voted in favour of this report .
given europe's increasingly aged population , this figure is likely to double over the next few decades .
i therefore support the motion for a resolution .
in this regard , a huge information campaign targeted at families must be carried out .
the launch of the new website at the start of 2009 is a welcome measure .
the european ombudsman is an extremely important institution as it brings the european union closer to its citizens .
at the same time , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for her efforts in completing this report .
the european parliament's delegation must adopt a strong , solid position as part of the negotiations .
this is precisely why I have considered it appropriate to support it in its entirety .
clearly , that view would not be completely mistaken .

pl mr president , on 14 october , the european commission announced its annual enlargement strategy .
incidentally , the same thing was said at the g8 summit in l aquila .
i therefore deplore these double standards and question whether the g20 will be capable of implementing these measures .
es mr president , the situation in the western sahara is very serious .
this is something unprecedented in international law .
save her life !
the language law is just one such sad , small chapter .
i invite all members to support this group in their political parties .
they will enable the continuation of an important and useful role of this parliament .
let me give you just a few examples .
mr president , tomorrow , tens of thousands of public sector workers in ireland take national strike action .
the eu council and commission are also culpable in demanding savage cuts in ireland .
de mr president , one in seven europeans belongs to an ethnic minority .
in spite of this fact , protection for autochthonous minorities in europe is not seen as a priority .
there is no unified approach in europe .
international law provisions are applied quite differently in different states .
let us revere and honour them .
mr david martin's flight has been delayed .
one minute speeches on matters of political importance continuation 
we now continue with the one minute speeches on matters of political importance .
in addition to this , 400 jobs are currently at risk in austria .
this is not what we are trying to achieve .
it is a negative development .
it appears that the european solidarity fund may be too restrictive to deal with this situation .
in hungary , opposition parties are physically attacked by the state , their members arrested and tortured .
this is shameful for the whole of the european union !
their prospects involve either life in a camp or lead polluted mitrovica .
in this age of information technology , information spreads between people very quickly .
it also has a reduced capacity to manage issues such as migration and crime at its borders .
colleagues have spoken about the unprecedented flooding that took place in ireland at the weekend .
two things need to happen .
first , the irish government needs to ensure that it and the local authorities implement the eu floods directive .
that is of paramount importance and must be done .
according to statistics , this year has been the bloodiest for the palestinian people .
i believe that the european parliament must speak out on this .
are these reports true ?
i shall support the commission's interpretation of the result of our negotiations over article finally , of course , the salient point that led us to conciliation amendment 1to conclude , I therefore ask everyone to think about the transposition of the package .
the eu approach is a very pragmatic one .
i think , however , that it is very important for us to now look decisively towards the future .
yet this must not lead to the expropriation of this remarkable tool to the benefit of private interests .
if it needs clarification , it is down to the commission to do that .
there are three reasons why I will be voting against this package .
freedom of expression should not be decided by the european court of justice .
it is not enough to have mediocre protection for citizensrights they must have complete protection .
however , the plenary also approved one amendment proposal which the council regarded as being difficult to enforce .
in 2007 alone , this sector had a turnover of around eur 300 billion .
the business sector is ready to take action and we also want to open doors .
an important decision has been made .
limitations should only be introduced after a fair and independent process .
mr president , we in the swedish pirate party support the compromise that was reached in conciliation .
the entire package , as it now stands , is exceptionally well balanced .
on the other hand , it makes particularly good provision for consumer protection .
this is a pièce de résistance of the art of negotiation .
it is contrary to the lisbon strategy and undermines the fundamental rights and values of the union .
at this point , I would like to thank my colleagues and , above all , the rapporteurs .
i still foresee a great deal of work ahead of us in this field .
that is all very important .
we have started to write history .
it is an entirely foreign element in the package .
two concrete answers to two concrete questions first , the declaration on article 19 relating to harmonisation procedures .
second , the question of cookies .
that is that and that should be applied now in the member states .
so I am very proud of the european institutions .
in the commissioner's response , she also stressed the same thing about article the european parliament will lend its support .
the debate is closed .
since then , the area has progressed dramatically .
the decision allows us finally to approve the changes to the framework directive for electronic communications networks and services .
he is the rapporteur of the two reports of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
again , I would like to stress that we support the aims of the council's framework decision .
of course , we support the development of europol .
we want a strong europol .
that is precisely what eu citizens now expect from us .
this is the only way that europol will be able to use its capacity for analysis to the full .
each work file is a separate database , each linked to a specific type of criminal activity .
the compulsory control by the european parliament is inalienable .
that is all for the moment .
this network was set up in 2001 by council decision 2001 / 427 / jha .
in particular , it was suggested that there should be an external secretariat financed with funds from community programmes .
this is a very serious matter .
unfortunately , this has not happened .
the treaty of lisbon is just about to enter into force .
nevertheless , I would now like to shed some light on these three dossiers for the benefit of parliament .
i now come to the matter of forensic laboratories .
again , I am aware of the problems with the legal basis .
naturally , we believe that crime must be prevented .
i refer here to our framework for forensic laboratories .
we would like to reform these provisions here .
the most personal information may be collected , including sexual preferences and bank account details .
in my opinion , we should stop this attack on data protection .
i am sure that they will be taken into account .
perhaps one should bear these thoughts in mind .
we are not rejecting the proposals of the council and the commission .
rather , we want to take part in the decision making process .
it is of the utmost importance that its functions are expanded further .
we need to do this in order to ensure the security of european citizens .
women and children are sold like commodities over the counter throughout our member states .
in just a few daystime , the treaty of lisbon will enter into full force .
however , there are many aspects of this matter which time does not permit us to discuss .
first , culture organised crime and mafia organisations can be eliminated above all with information and awareness .
there will be other texts on europol , and parliament will , of course , be colegislator .
it would be very difficult to interrupt europol's work .
may I also clarify that the head of europol is now a british man of great quality .
should existing instruments become obsolete or need supplementing or updating , then we will be able to make proposals .
deputising for the rapporteur . mr president , we have had a very good debate this evening .
i can only say that he has set the standards very high for his successor .
it is not even about the national parliaments being sidelined .
this is about accountability to the citizen , because it concerns very important decisions .
those are the ones that the council is accountable to , more than to us .
to summarise very briefly , what is the european police office , the new office ?
we should , however , consider what is least defined .
i should , in particular , also like to thank mr barrot for having taken our concerns on board .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 24 november 200written statements rule 149 
use of information technology for customs purposes debate 
mr president , I would like to welcome commissioner kallas and my fellow members .
the only measure on which parliament does not agree is the extension of europol's powers in this field .
this view is certainly not reflected in all political groups in this house .
i understand the commission's motives , as well as the desire to maintain consistency , very well indeed .
it would make the legislation more transparent for the citizens and would surely also benefit europol's work .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 .
the next item is the joint debate on 
and
the situation is now very grave .
under the current treaty rules , we are merely consulted .
let me now turn to the instrument of macro financial assistance and to its future under the lisbon treaty .
this is why I welcome these proposals for macro financial assistance .
the conflict in georgia in 2008 caused a serious worsening of the economic situation in the country .
madam president , I would like to take this opportunity to make three final points .
serbia , however badly affected by the financial and economic crisis , is rapidly returning to political stability .
i ask my colleagues to support it unanimously .
i believe that this initiative is part of the european neighbourhood policy .
firstly , who should chair our delegation to cosac ?
my view is that we absolutely should .
we must find flexible solutions .
it is worth pointing out this fact at this stage .
rules of procedure should be established according to a broad consensus .
other proposals for amendments must be discussed in greater depth .
we will have sufficient time to do so in this house .
i find it regrettable that you , sir , as our president , think otherwise .
i think it is a misunderstanding .
nothing is closed from this point of view .
but you have very much opened this discussion .
what is it that you are doing here ?
to what am I referring ?
i am referring to article 192 1 .
however , we will find a solution to this problem .
this was decided by the conference of presidents , and we have to implement this decision .
this is only a technical question and nothing more .
let me quote just one example .
so far , europe's commissioners have actually said that these are not part of community law .
it is something that should be decided by the meps themselves .
i have a feeling that the empire is striking back .
this would be a true starting point for institutions that safeguard , not control , citizenslives .
may you make the right decision , and may we all see it .
rapporteur . mr president , my thanks to all those colleagues who have spoken in this debate .
closure of the sitting
opening of the sitting
what is currently on the table is not sufficient overall to achieve the two degree target .
this has also happened .
without an offer from the us and china , only half of this is covered .
i look forward to the dialogue .
i am also counting wholeheartedly on the support of the members of parliament in copenhagen .
in copenhagen , we must aim high so as to achieve an agreement based on scientific findings .
it was so interesting that it was not possible to stop it !
the clock is ticking .
president obama is not yet able to keep his election promise .
i should like to commend the efforts of the swedish presidency and the european commission , particularly commissioner dimas .
the resolution that we are putting forward today has all the elements for an ambitious agreement in copenhagen .
yet what we are proposing is also realistic .
in contrast to the council , parliament has given specific figures in this regard .
mrs wortmann kool has already mentioned the kick start .
we need eur 5 to 7 billion straight away .
this really has to deserve a major effort from us all , therefore .
it concerns the future of the entire human race .
moreover , as minister carlgren has said , the recession has made it cheaper to reduce emissions .
applause 
mr president , council and commission , it is one month today until christmas eve .
only in that way will we create new jobs in europe in the long term .
someone asked about the practical side .
the eu has shown the way here .
we have , in fact , already got half way towards our 2020 target of 20 % .
and , of course , this must be science based .
for the 30 % reduction , I have to add the following .
if this remains a purely european story , time will start to run out .
please , commissioner , can you give me some reassurance on that front ?
this glacier is now melting and it is moving at two metres an hour two metres an hour !
you can see it with the naked eye .
per day !
and that is before the effects of climate change really hit us .
i know that this is not the fault of these two gentlemen .
there are many people who have already decided that copenhagen will be a fiasco .
i would therefore like to wish you the best of luck with the negotiations in copenhagen .
we have 65 heads of government attending .
the question is is it enough ?
are we giving you enough room for manoeuvre ?
now , is this a shift in our negotiating position ?
copenhagen can succeed , copenhagen must succeed , and the european union still holds the key to its success .
this means that europe is faced with a choice should we continue to go it alone or not ?
emissions trading also has many disadvantages .
it is technological innovation that will be our saviour , not trade in hot air .
she had her laptop on the whole day .
our amendments are concerned with three points .
but the heretics will have a voice in copenhagen and the truth will out .
climate change is being used to impose an anti human utopia as deadly as anything conceived by stalin or mao .
it is therefore much more important to curb this deforestation than to take part in such a numbers race .
sv mr president , I am pleased to see the swedish minister's commitment .
can mr carlgren promise to give us clear information before copenhagen ?
let them take a big step towards tomorrow's economy , an economy involving minimum use of raw materials .
mr carlgren , commissioner dimas , let the big players stop holding each other to ransom .
de mr president , in many parts of the world the consequences of climate change are visible .
is it perhaps because greenland was once green when the world was hotter ?
we have got to keep investing in energy efficiency , in renewables and in low carbon technology .
commissioner dimas , I want to thank you .
pl madam president , I would like to appeal for a sense of proportion .
the decisions on specific limits in the climate package were not made in a precise and detailed way .
fi madam president , we should be protecting employees , small entrepreneurs and industry .
things will not go well with the present target percentages .
support for the left is melting away faster than the icebergs .
if we want to be successful , we must seriously consider using all the technologies available .
we have to act and we have to do so immediately .
nl I should like to discuss the transport aspect .
and yet the stakes we are playing for in copenhagen are a lot higher than that .
do not let the epitaph for copenhagen be that this was the age of stupid .
maybe it is not just certain cows that have gone mad .
i am on the committee on international trade .
my second point is that parliament has adopted a clear position for the copenhagen summit .
there is a clear remit for what is to be achieved .
we need to also take that into account .
another member also pointed out that our contribution is 10 % .
realism and negotiating on specifics , then , are what is needed then we will probably make progress .
2007 was a decisive year , because we set out our precise objectives .
we need action on a global scale .
the president cut off the speaker 
thirdly , politics must take note of a debate emerging in science .
this is why educational work is also so important .
i have the impression that the opinions of european citizens are increasingly diverging from those of the political elite .
we need to work at educating the citizens , and the european commission should be responsible for this .
the european union must continue to lead the negotiations and apply pressure to the other parties .
however , we are seeing something of a figures race , a finance race , in our debates .
europe must not be naive with regard to china and india .
firstly , in relation to the first point combating the increase in temperature .
we need to go further than that .
rail transport has been mentioned .
we need to adopt this resolution , which has three noble aspirations .
success at the summit will , therefore , amount to success regarding the three aspirations .
it really is too soon to mention the deadline of the cop16 in december 20we must now turn our rhetoric into genuine political will .
as evidence of this , I would cite the climate change package that was signed under the french presidency .
in copenhagen , the eyes of the international public will be glued on its ruling class .
this financing must be in addition to the resources that the rich nations have already promised for fighting poverty .
only then will it be possible to reduce distortions in international competitiveness .
we must reach decisions that are even more binding than those taken in kyoto .
we have an opportunity to take this historic step with the environment .
major international powers are still reluctant to demonstrate the full ambition that the climate change emergency requires of us .
as a result of this , they have taken on extremely heavy economic and social responsibilities .
in actual fact , this study is an indictment of european agriculture .
they damage the land of indigenous peoples , with the result that they have to relocate .
i will bring up these issues when we discuss future resolutions .
time is moving on and there will be no second chance .
this is the time it must be done .
this is a key part of our concern .
yet there can be no satisfactory progress without close collaboration , in particular , amongst the global players .
the president cut off the speaker 
we should also set an example .
it will not happen straight away in copenhagen .
that is also why parliament's commitment and that of the whole of the eu is so important .
madam president , this was a very interesting debate with some exceptional and constructive interventions .
numerous views on various issues have been heard .
very possibly certain people do not agree .
i should also like to comment on the world environmental organisation .
we are fast approaching the finishing line .
we must make sure that the earth does not heat up by more than two degrees .
europe must also find effective and reasonable solutions to the issue of funding .
it is worth noting that the eu has surpassed the goals drawn up in kyoto .
i believe that the copenhagen agreement to reduce global carbon emissions should be binding .
we must also send a clear signal to emerging industries in asia .
there is also the problem of the desertification of vast areas of the earth .
no .
it is not a matter of adapting to climate change , but of proactive action .
energy consumption and polluting emissions can be reduced quickly and cheaply by boosting energy efficiency on a global scale .

they have educated and industrious workforces but they have relatively cheap costs and therefore competitive exports .
we will also have to urgently take up the crucial issue of internet copyright .
nevertheless , it does give internet users legal means of defending themselves .
adoption of the trautmann report means that the provisions of the telecoms package will shortly enter into force .
this solution will certainly please the supporters of open access to the internet .
this state of affairs undermines people's rights .
as a defender of civil rights , I am bound to be opposed to this decision .
these provisions will therefore have a major economic impact .
unfortunately , the regulation will now contribute to this misinterpretation .
this is why I voted in favour of this report .
the draft will also provide greater protection for confidential data .
these networks are very important to the development of europe's traffic infrastructure .
i do not believe that this is the right course .
this parliament must fully assume its new powers in these matters .
in view of this , I am voting in favour of this report requesting the council withdraw its proposal .
crime is continually on the increase in the european union .
the progress made by the crime prevention network over the last few years has been rather limited .
nevertheless , the interim measures are adequate in order to effect important alterations as soon as possible .
i do not believe that this is the right course .
this parliament must fully assume its new powers in these matters .
yet theaidgiven by the eu seems to have had little to do with solidarity .
we do not accept european loans and subsidies being subject to restrictions imposed by the imf .
you can see what kinds of conditions are involved impossible deadlines , a lack of information .
rules on compensation for delays to international rail services are not enough .
for this reason , all reproaches are invalid .
the central point is that the report cites a judgment at first instance which has been repealed .
we have tried to get this incomplete and therefore incorrect report taken off the agenda , unfortunately without success .
a conviction was not made .
the next item is the question hour with the president of the commission .
i welcome the agreement reached on 19 november in yalta .
however , we know that ukraine had great trouble in settling its gas bill with russia last month .
like you , I wish to prevent a repetition of last year's crisis .
i sympathise with that position .
we are reading and hearing rumours that are rather dangerous .
we all have demands made of us .
a week ago , only three women were prospective candidates .
unfortunately , it is not provided for by the treaty .
there is also talk of lightweights and heavyweights .
in europe , tens of millions of people are affected by unemployment , poverty and social exclusion .
that is why I think it is important to work on matters relating to social inclusion .
one of the priority areas of the european union 2020 strategy will thus be to empower people .
why did you wait until after the german election ?
there is no problem about that .
that is the best way to ensure that we remain fair in our union .
i would add a further question to this .
i know she will do a fantastic job .
we all know that this in an innovation .
bg first of all , I want to make one clarification for mr schulz .
to put it simply , we have the same person performing the task of javier solana and benita ferrero waldner .
that seems to be happening in bosnia , which is sliding alarmingly towards dysfunction if not destruction .
i would like to say something which is very serious .
in fact , it is becoming an extremely difficult matter .
de you just spoke of how you have now opened the consultations for the post lisbon process .
we cannot define a project for the european union in three months .
the details will be published on the internet today , if they are not already on there .
i myself am ready to make a commitment .
in any case , the spring european council marks the beginning , not the end , of the process .
let me say that I was very happy also with the nomination of herman van rompuy .
i would like to thank all those who made the approval of this budget possible .
on the same day , she will become responsible for the external relations portfolio as vice president of the commission .
presumably , that will be the task of the european parliament and its members .
so I believe they have the qualities to fulfil their responsibilities .
so this is a very important coordinating role for climate action , both internally and externally .
my answer is the following .
we have to look at this .
we have to look at own resources of the european union .
de the commission is pushing on with the accession negotiations with turkey in an extremely uncritical way .
this means that prices rise and development becomes impossible .
proof of this is the fact that decisions by the commission have always been taken by consensus .
in my view , focusing on immigration in that way is not only wrong but also dangerous .
issues relating to immigration have a security aspect .
frontex takes care of this .
the palestinian people , like other peoples , have a right to a dignified existence that fulfils their aspirations .
when it comes to combating cross border crime , the challenges are great .
we need common solutions to common problems .
they may seem like very technical issues , but they are very important for individual citizens .
one of the most important issues is the abolition of the exequatur procedure .
the issue of solidarity and division of responsibility will be dealt with in the stockholm programme .
another important element of the common asylum system is what is known as theexternal dimension.
this is one aspect that the majority of member states would like to see reflected in the stockholm programme .
finally , I would like to say a few words about the treaty of lisbon .
as my colleague mrs ask said , we now look forward to hearing your views .
that is why we will present an action plan on unaccompanied minors in early 20we are now going to be able to put all of this into practice .
this hinges on training .
on the subject of asylum , I support your call for genuine solidarity between the member states .
you mention on several occasions , in your resolution , the importance of monitoring , the conducting of assessments .
finally , the european parliament must take subsidiarity seriously .
now , what has this got to do with us ?
do we consider others inferior ?
i ask you , what happened to the founding myth of the european idea , in this case ?
europe must finally leave this trend behind it and put the wrong moves of recent years under the microscope .
that also means consciously standing up and advocating what you believe in .
the stockholm programme completely fails to address the real challenges of the present day .
this is where stockholm fails .
freedom is not something to be negotiated , it is a universal right for every human being .
concerns in relation to data protection law are simply brushed aside in the fight against purported terror .
it was thus inevitable that there would be these problems linked to the pace of work .
the document under consideration by this parliament cannot be explained in the few seconds that remain to me .
one example is the immigration policy .
andrew symeou , a 20 year old london man , was extradited to greece this summer on a manslaughter charge .
he now languishes in a greek prison awaiting trial .
the evidence against him would not stand up for five minutes if examined by a british court .
the identification evidence is contradictory .
the british courts cannot now protect british citizens from unjust arrest and imprisonment by foreign courts .
we will succeed by means of the stockholm programme , which is a five year work programme .
parliament's resolution defines the european parliament's political priorities in this area .
we cannot accept the liberal group's presumption to the right to monopolise the principle of non discrimination .
the borders between the member states are not impermeable walls , but nets through which society filters daily .
this is not the case at present and there are severe weaknesses .
so I am very pleased that mrs ask and mr barroso have spoken about this .
mr president , my special thanks to the three secretariats who got this resolution ready for this plenary .
it is another step in the building of the eu state .
it is nothing other than the pooling of sovereignty .
what are we doing to protect them ?
let us finally show some sense of pragmatism in our institutions !
we fight our progressive corner and , for our group , we will fight for our progressive policies .
i welcome the equal weighting given to the three sides of this triangle .
contrary to certain more radical views , I believe that all three are necessary .
finally , much work remains to be done together towards creating a europe of citizens .
it is not going to produce reports merely to be heard , as was the case until now .
mr president , congratulations to all of those concerned with this report and congratulations to the swedish presidency .
that applies most particularly to minorities , who are so often maligned and misrepresented .
equality and equality of treatment are the only durable building blocks of any civilised society .
of course , the stockholm programme will be what we make it .
let us give it a chance .
the president cut off the speaker 
i believe that the stockholm programme should serve all the residents of the eu , not just a few .
the president cut off the speaker 
the president cut off the speaker 
i am very pleased to see the commitment that you are showing in respect of these important issues .
the truth is that the european parliament is mid way through the discussions and negotiations that are ongoing .
you can then send us your points of view so that they are taken into account .
now we can make a difference and that is exactly what we should do .
it is when we need cooperation that we must use the european institutions .
i think that this type of argument is completely irrelevant .
the global approach to migration should be one of the important starting points in this connection .
the situation in the mediterranean is not primarily a border control problem .
it is a problem that requires several different types of measure .
we must retain the benefits of this .
having heard the different aspirations of various people , this text strikes a certain balance .
i would add that we cannot accept the termfortress europeeither .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 .
the eu's area of freedom , security and justice is entering a decisive phase .
the programme will be implemented after the treaty of lisbon comes into force .
however , creating a europe for its citizens goes far beyond simply drafting a programme .
the rights , freedoms and principles enshrined in the charter of fundamental rights are given binding force .
this will be the task of spain's forthcoming eu presidency .
the growth in discrimination and intolerance are increasingly serious social problems .
linguistic genocide is going on in two eu countries as well at the moment .
they must be the guiding principles for the member statescooperation within the union .
i am going to run through the principles .
what about these return operations involving several repatriated persons , insofar as each person's file was assessed individually ?
it will be soon , and it will enable some additional guarantees to be given to the persons concerned .
the fact is , there is a limit to the member statesabsorption capacity .
with this in mind , I would ask for clarification on three points .
commissioner , this is not the europe that we love .
europe is not there to legitimise national practices that violate fundamental rights .
i am very grateful for any explanations you can give us .
is afghanistan a safe country ?
everyone and I most of all welcomes the future binding character of the charter of fundamental rights .
mr president , I found part of the discussion a bit strange .
why are the people here illegally ?
so , just on this last ground , all the women fleeing from there should be given asylum .
i would like to start by attempting to sum up some of the most important principles in this matter .
that is exactly what an individual review aims to clarify and ensure .
the purpose of the establishment of a common european asylum system is to achieve this aim .
i shall read the following , from the french response .
that being said , I would also like to respond on the matter of group flights .
it is this point that we are also currently examining at the request of the european council .
and we have some problems .
we are not there yet , and there are still some countries that do not receive refugees .
that is what I wished to say .
that concludes the item .
in reality , this was nothing new .
what was new was that in april , parliament put a stop to it .
at the end of september , something finally happened .
let me make myself clear that was a smart move by the council a very smart move .
the ball is now in the council's court .
today we are talking about discharge for 200if we look closer at the main issues , there is actually no reason not to grant discharge .
this quite simply highlights the importance of dialogue between our institutions in future , too .
lisbon must not become a synonym for an opaque european union in which parliamentary supervision has been steamrollered .
we are overcoming the council's aversion to working with parliament .
we do not have significant reservations here .
very significant progress has been made with the council , which at first did not want to respond .
yet we must admit that this remains a difficult exercise .
after all , the problems have not been solved .
in april 2009 , the budgetary control committee decided to postpone discharge to the council .
last spring , extra budgetary accounts suddenly emerged and the council was not granted discharge .
the second was that the council refused to provide any comprehensive written answers .
no , you cannot .
at this point , I will refrain from commenting on the seriousness of this line of argument .
there is still a very long way to go .
in future , this policy will also have a face , in the shape of baroness ashton .
i believe that since parliament's refusal to give discharge to the council , many efforts have been made .
thank you very much for this debate .
that was the position we started from .
i agree that we have not achieved everything we wanted to .
we have come a step closer , however .
we will be starting from the point we have reached this year .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 25 november 200written statements rule 149 
the sitting was suspended at 19.25 until the start of question time and resumed at 19.30 
2009 is the european year of creativity and innovation .
the action plan was put forward in 2005 , while the broadly framed innovation strategy dates from 200i would be happy , mrs ţicău , to provide you with all these documents once again .
that target is to spend 3 % of gross domestic product on research and development .
we have good , and in some cases outstanding , research capacities .
it is necessary , in this regard , however , to take an even handed view .
these programmes are creating very positive experiences and we should extend them for that reason .
what action will the commission take against pharmaceuticals companies that attempt to curtail parallel trading in the medicines sector ?
will it categorise such measures as anti competitive ?
there is no discrimination at all .
i am not aware of there being anyone in the commission with the intention of dealing with this subject .
you ask why there cannot be a standard bill for all consumers .
at the same time , greater transparency and comparability of offered prices and services to consumers should be ensured .
billing accuracy is closely related to metering frequency .
the second is financial markets , and the third is local transport .
self regulation is not sufficient .
i can only encourage everyone to look at this example and make maximum use of it .
the commission has so far adopted four regulations authorising or rejecting health claims .
i must say we were amazed by the number of applications received .
what will happen then ?
we are talking now about health claims .
an overview of these national institutions and organisations is available on the website .
the commission promotes awareness of consumer rights through various instruments .
i also have some news which is very important for us .
i thank the commissioner for her response .
you are absolutely right that we need to compare how many complaints are coming in different domains .
i shall , however , certainly pass on the message .
is this practice in compliance with the package travel directive 90 / 314 / eec ?
the package travel directive would only apply if car rentals are included in a holiday package .
there must be some directive which the companies are breaching .
i think this is a major problem .
a very clear message should go out that this is extortionist .
i hired a car in frankfurt for my first day in parliament here .
why not step up our efforts and do some kind of enforcement sweep in the car rental industry also ?
subject action programme for reducing administrative burdens in the eu
mr papastamkos , this question gives me the opportunity to relate to you a very pleasing tale of success .
despite this , the commission still stands by its proposal .
and thirdly , what measures will you take to attract tourists from other countries outside the european union ?
mr leichtfried , in relation to the first question , I would say that we can always try .
i want to mention just one example , as it has recently been very successful .
three years ago , we launched the european destinations of excellence eden competition .
subject participation by the social partners in devising and implementing employment policies at national and european level
the aim is to protect employment and particularly long term employment rather than specific jobs .
these three key priorities were approved at the june meeting of the european council .
thank you for that remark , mr posselt .
i resisted making those same comments to other commissioners tonight .
questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing see annex .
the next item is a joint debate on
i hope that you can confirm this again today .
a total of eur 14.8 million is envisaged for this .
we have questioned both commissioner špidla and commissioner kroes on this matter .
you tell us that the european social fund cannot be the only source of funding .
it is true that the european social fund has technically been the main source of funding so far .
that is the principle issue .
in both of these cases , I have therefore provided a clear statement , I believe .
these are resources designated for supporting persons , individual persons and not companies .
the factory in ireland focuses on producing desktop computers .
i must , however , stress that we are only halfway there .
in my opinion , this exposes a serious inconsistency in industrial and employment policy .
therefore , the question is how will the commission and the member states together ensure consistency in their policy ?
in particular , I would like to welcome gerry and denis who are with us this evening .
unfortunately , I also have some regrets about the way in which the egaf works .
in this respect , I fully support the comments made previously by my colleague , mrs berès .
this will allow us to preserve jobs and therefore protect workers in the long term .
that is what the globalisation fund allows us to do .
he said that we cannot influence business decisions .
this help for particular sectors in different countries is an appropriate expression of social solidarity within the eu .
we simply feel that better use can be made of it .
it is true that at the time the fund was created , this was not actually possible .
nonetheless , the fund can operate in this way .
the second issue is that of the dell case itself .
i must emphasise that these finances are intended for redundant employees and not companies .
nevertheless , this objective remains very distant , and I have the following questions 
can the commission back up its response with sound reasons ?
those are my questions , mr president , commissioner .
the euromed free trade area also has a south south dimension .
the bilateral approach must be accompanied by a regional approach .
i believe in it even less since the facts speak for themselves .
this is bound to be at the direct or indirect cost of the british taxpayer .
nowhere to be seen for these two countries , both of which have a long and frankly despicable record .
tonight we are discussing a free trade agreement in the euromed .
i , too , have a question for the commissioner .
mr moreira put some very precise questions to the commissioner .
i would therefore also like to know where the commission stands on this issue .
this commitment is part of the european commission's political project .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 25 november 200safety and interoperability of the community railroad system debate 
hence this oral question .
we here in the european parliament have always taken rail safety very seriously .
and what about interoperability in the rail sector ?
i have spoken for a long time , but there were a great many questions .
the intensity , in particular , is being neglected on cost grounds , and maintenance intervals are being lengthened .
what is the situation with regard to a europe wide certification system for maintenance works ?
why not ?
if it is ac , it is either 15 kv , or 30 kv , or 35 kv .
all of the others have differences between them .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , safety is a sacred thing .
this state of affairs cannot go on .
safety arguments are also often put forward when someone wants to stand in the way of competition .
a third of the network is going to ruin through lack of resources to maintain it .
there is always a need for more profit .
once again , the european general interest is being sacrificed for the sake of capitalist greed .
we have gone down the wrong road here .
in my view , there are huge delays on this aspect .
as you know , representatives of all the institutions , parliament and the council were invited to the conference .
i believe that this is an important element which should not be forgotten .
the debate is closed .
i thank him for making this point .
in any case , why is it a punishable offence for someone to speak in their mother tongue ?
mr president , just a final word .
mrs bauer , you were critical of the language law .
the language law is not as good as it might be , that has indeed been established .
it does not infringe fundamental rights , however .
that must be our concern .
together , we have a range of problems .
slovakia and hungary , too , have problems together , such as the problem of the romani .
finally , in parliament , itself we do not fulfil this multilingualism requirement .
slovak is one of the most beautiful languages in europe but it is seldom heard in the european parliament .
i firmly believe that we will succeed in protecting the diversity of slovak language and culture .
the slovak language does not wish to develop at the expense of other languages .
let us take a look , for example , at the upbringing of children and at schools .
the hungarian government closed them down in 196they are taught slovak by hungarian speaking teachers who are not proficient in the slovak language .
is a minority language of value ?
this should not be a dispute between slovakia and hungary .
it should be an issue to be resolved between the european union safeguarding its values and slovakia .
this implies that the minority are second class citizens in their homeland .
it is not two countries fighting against each other .
it would only help to generate pointless frustration for many loyal citizens .
secondly , it grossly interferes in people's personal lives , as pointed out by edit bauer .
thirdly , it is anti democratic because it instils fear among citizens .
sk I would like to remain consistently on the topic of our debate .
failure to do this would lead to the loss of a rich cultural heritage .
all languages are equal , the same way that all human beings are equal .
ten million people speak catalan , and this language is not allowed to be spoken in this house .
removing this programme will deprive bulgaria's largest minority of the right to information in their mother tongue .
pace vouǎ !
boží pokoj s vami !
this is a downright scandal and disgrace .
we would like to thank president jerzy buzek for his mission to slovakia aimed at resolving the issue .
sk I originally wanted to respond to mr bokros but you did not give me the floor .
we cannot say either that this does not feature in the law .
the problem lies exactly in the law's presentation .
the law actually bans those exchanges in hospitals where the hungarian language is under represented .
i therefore think that there are very serious problems with this .
on the other hand , the hungarians have not wiped out their minorities , but have kept them separate .
sk I must protest against the previous speaker .
these are absolute lies , falsehoods and untruths .
i would like to state as a regional representative that our cooperation is exemplary .
we need to have dialogue and we cannot achieve this without languages .
there are also specific examples of the way in which we support these languages .
on the other hand , the use of two languages is made compulsory even when it is entirely unjustified .
they have schools where instruction is given in their mother tongues .
all decisions are issued in romanian as well as in the language of the minorities in that region .
' made in origin marking motions for resolutions tabled see minutes
the european council also reached agreement on the appointment of pierre de boissieu as secretary general of the council secretariat .
it is therefore not yet time to withdraw the support measures that have been taken .
the financial sector's need for support measures has diminished .
the presidency then received the mandate to initiate negotiations with the european parliament , which we have done .
it is a decision I welcome and personally support very much .
i would like to concentrate very briefly on three key dossiers which will be under the spotlight .
first , climate change .
sometimes we see politicians and diplomats negotiating .
now the lisbon treaty gives us a new opportunity to move ahead .
it brings this area of policy fully within the scope of our normal procedures .
i , along with the ppe group , expect all this from the council's first permanent presidency .
in this respect , we are expecting concrete undertakings from the european council .
the second topic is climate change .
once again , I would like to direct my remarks today at you , mr barroso .
we have achieved what we have been fighting for .
in my opinion , we are not talking enough about climate change .
can europe's energy security problems be solved peacefully ?
therefore , I would like finally to repeat my remarks to mr barroso .
we social democrats have discussed our ideas with you .
for our group , the basic point here is the balance between security and freedom .
i think this is the big ambition and what the stockholm programme has to do .
we are going in the opposite direction .
however , it is important for us that women are not only taken into account in terms of numbers .
you can rely on us to help you ensure that these women have influential positions within the commission .
we do not want mere token gestures .
we will have the opportunity to get to know them even better in the hearings .
everyone is saying that the belgians are very proud of him .
we are drawing too few logical conclusions from our discussions .
another agenda item for the next summit is the lisbon strategy .
it was a serious mistake not to put swift on the agenda .
why should they be interested in the intricacies of codecision if their children face such an uncertain future ?
it is go , go , go all the time .
mr president , I would like to welcome the two candidates on behalf of the gue / ngl group .
above all , we welcome the fact that a woman has been elected .
however , we urgently need concrete proposals describing how all of this will be implemented .
secondly , the council must finally commit to a strict control system for the financial markets .
voluntary commitments have never achieved the desired objective .
on behalf of the efd group . mr president , you are all very downbeat this morning .
the kissinger question of who to call in europe has not really been answered , has it ?
she has never had a proper job , and she has never been elected to anything in her life .
her appointment is an embarrassment for britain .
interjection from the floor 
well , at least I have been elected , sir , unlike her !
she has not been elected , and the people do not have the power to remove her .
i do not think she is a fit and proper person to do this job .
she has no experience and she must answer those questions .
that question must be answered .
we have to stand up for them .
and , mr farage , I would like to quote a hungarian saying to you .
things have gone horribly , horribly wrong .
but can I please come back and ask you a question , mr president ?
mr president , my thanks to the group leaders for their very inspiring contributions .
i will , of course , speak again at the end of this debate .
it also has to do with the stockholm programme .
the swift programme is , indeed , a very valuable instrument for member states in their fight against terrorism .
we are not talking about theoretical cases .
we are talking about actual cases .
the information was passed to the governments of european and middle eastern nations .
i would like to buck the trend .
for this reason , I believe that it was a good choice to put forward mr van rompuy .
this means we will have to work much harder .
on the contrary , it is going to become more complicated .
this is a major achievement .
the first point is the council president .
it is right that you should work together with the council .
but many of us feel that we have missed a critical opportunity .
how is the eu responding to this ?
europe is changing and I hope that the new president will recognise and respond to this .
his words are a testament to the wisdom and good sense of his insight .
evidently , some had been hoping for some kind of european superman .
when we talk of enlargement , we understand that turkey is a large chapter in the debate .
they do , indeed .
these will obviously depend on how charismatic and determined the person ending up in this post is .
however , this involves a decisive step against the united states .
i prefer to recall with you the rights and duties of we meps .
indeed , we have a right to carry out this process it is conferred by the treaties .
having said that , I shall now take up a number of points .
we owe it to them .
secondly , there are other walls to be brought down , including those in our heads .
many people also believe that it is possible to play off europe and democracy against one another .
however , only a democratic europe can be successful in the long term .
i hope that parliament will take an active role in this strategy .
europe's citizens must be at the heart of this strategy .
i do not want my children or my grandchildren to ask why I did not act .
in a week where we started with only three women in the commission , we finish with nine .
what has not been done to save the treaty of lisbon ?
these are the challenges that our electorate wants us to tackle .
this parliament shall be committed to guarding the citizensinterests in the laws we adopt .
we must pay much , much more attention to creating new jobs and securing existing ones .
we need to make a determined effort to gain added value for our european project .
first and foremost , the way is now open for common european policies .
they also have become more vulnerable due to competitive disadvantage if compared to the euro area members .
it also introduces new institutions , such as president of the european council and high representative for foreign policy .
we know that these appointments have caused discussion and controversy , including here in this chamber .
i think another reshuffle could certainly fulfil this requirement in the future .
this , too , is a matter for the forthcoming council .
some previous speakers have criticised both the president and the high representative , which I consider quite inappropriate .
i wish mr herman van rompuy , the first president of the council , every success .
in this respect , we have heard much talk of a powerful europe .
this question is very closely linked to the stockholm programme .
in particular , we need to protect those who cannot protect themselves .
europe's power lies in its joint efforts , whether we speak of the humanitarian or the intergovernmental method .
i think that this criticism is unfair .
if it were true , it would be quite absurd .
we now need to provide the necessary resources in order to invest in the internal market .
a presidential style guru strutting the world stage , causing trouble ?
it is also time to plot the route ahead .
the leaders of the central banks have alerted governments to an ambitious plan to correct deficits .
i am sorry that the portuguese government is not going down the route of lowering taxes .
one concerns the sale of carbon dioxide quotas after 20the commission and some of the old eu member states want to ban the sale of quotas after 20the countries mentioned , including hungary , have fulfilled , failed to fulfil and overfulfilled their kyoto commitments .
the debate about the institutions is over and the debate about staffing as well , I hope .
the treaty of lisbon , on the other hand , is a call for europeanisation and for policy making .
how will we handle the financial and economic crisis ?
we cannot do this by defending existing rights , but by searching for global solutions .
i also expect us to review our finances .
the solution will come from the peoples , it will come from the european parliament .
many people are afraid that the treaty of lisbon could result in increased centralism in europe .
we need to establish a road map for its introduction .
filling vacancies is only the beginning .
a certain kind of balance between these important values is essential here .
we are , of course , pleased that turkey continues to have european integration as an overarching objective .
at the summit in october , the european council approved a general framework for this service .
i hope that the new commission will be able to table such a proposal as soon as possible .
eight years after laeken , we are now on the threshold of a new treaty .
thank you very much for a very good and constructive debate .
perhaps we should also bring this up in different meetings during the rest of today .
this is an important step forward .
let me also comment on the appointments of a new high representative and a new council president .
i think it has been a fruitful and constructive discussion , and thanks for all your contributions .
it will also be handed over to cecilia malmström with warm hands from all of us .
i would just like to comment on one thing concerning the stockholm programme .
this is good news for european citizens and also for all eu institutions .
that concludes the debate .
written statements rule 149 
labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency 
following the blocking by the administration , this obligation has not been met since july .
this , mr president , is a real disgrace , and I choose my words carefully .
would the rapporteur like to say something about this ?
we are not voting on this .
preparation of the copenhagen summit on climate change vote 
i just wanted to announce this so that you know when we come to that place in the vote .
this is our request to the commission .
perhaps mrs reding would like to say something on this subject .
applause 
de mr president , what mr ferber rightly complained about has happened again .
i heard 33 , then 30 and then 43 , making it very unclear .
fr mr president , I can assure you that the speed of the vote is perfect .
thank you for that remark !
passenger compensation in the event of airline bankruptcy vote 
for the results and other details on the vote see minutes 
oral explanations of vote
mr president , the first duty of any assembly is to hold the executive to account .
secondly , instead of supporting the unemployed directly , this fund supports national employment security systems .
in ireland , it provides an unemployed person with eur 6 000 of support .
surely this money should be returned to taxpayers so they can spend it as they see fit .
the first is that we need to reach a legally binding agreement .
climate change is a global political priority at the copenhagen summit .
environmentalism is too important to be left to just one side of the political debate to apply its solutions .
the next task is to set up a european judicial area .
no home secretary in any member state could say that today .
the outcome of this will be even more immigration and all the problems which that leads to .
just consider the fact that many romani women and underage children are being required to go .
mr president , as has been said , this report includes two objects of concern .
this is a major reason for concern since it is completely contrary to the european spirit .
et over the past nine years , 77 airlines have filed for bankruptcy .
millions of our citizens use low cost airlines every day .
this would allow the repatriation of passengers left stranded in foreign airports .
this has driven many other airlines into an unhealthily competitive situation .
et with the lisbon agenda , the european union aimed to strengthen economic union .
thank you .
instead , it embodies the fundamental economic principle of levelling the playing field .
another advantage of this type of labelling is that the labelling of wet grip tyres will increase road safety .
the aim is to promote the use of safe , quieter tyres .
they can thus make a more environmentally friendly choice and reduce their carbon footprint .
moreover , labelling will lead to increased competition among manufacturers .
this labelling is beneficial from an environmental point of view .
these recommendations include the need for eco driving , checking the tyre pressure regularly and complying with the stopping distance .
the crucial role of this fund is clear .
it would therefore be better if applications were submitted separately in future .
this fund provides individual , one off and time limited support directly to workers made redundant .
the redundancies at dell have seriously affected the local limerick economy and surrounding areas .
the treaty of lisbon makes the international fight against climate change a specific objective of eu environmental policy .
for this reason , I have voted no .
the european parliament is a component of the reactionary construct of the eu .
up to 80 % of adaptation and mitigation policies will be implemented at a regional or local level .
industrialised countries and emerging countries with more advanced economies should be subject to comparable efforts .
the un estimates that all but one of its emergency appeals for humanitarian aid in 2007 were climate related .
ireland's per capita carbon emission is 17.5 tonnes per annum .
indeed , climate change will require increased investment in the public sector .
i believe that the copenhagen agreement should be binding .
i believe that the agreement should be global , ambitious and with a clear timeline .
however , the importance attributed to so called market solutions , and to carbon trading in particular , is indisputable .
it cannot set an example and pay for the rest of the world too .
i am firmly opposed to additional restrictive targets without a comprehensive , international agreement .
it is also essential that the united states plays its part in this extremely important matter .
we will have to wait and see to what extent the copenhagen conference will change this .
against this background , rules are needed for the financing process , together with sanctions for non compliance .
in this way , it would give an example to other countries , despite the difficulties involved .
it should also be remembered that the eu has not accepted any unconditional obligations , only conditional ones .
its only drawback is that the production of nuclear energy has somehow crept in .
these phenomena cannot be properly addressed by the leaders of capital , the very people responsible for creating them .
the greek communist party voted against the european parliament resolution .
i voted against the motion for numerous reasons my main reasons are outlined below .
we believe that it is vital that women are not subjected to violence or the sex trade .
this resolution is a step towards progressive european lawmaking on migration .
it is important to manage this , and the european parliament resolution passed today helps in this respect .
i hope this loophole will be filled as part of realisation of the stockholm programme .
however , just making a law is not enough .
it is also a resolution which guarantees the protection of refugees and migrants .
i deeply regret the fact that the resolution has been watered down as regards the anti discrimination dossier .
i welcome the adoption of the motion for a resolution on the stockholm programme .
the population needs increasing levels of security .
unfortunately , plenary did not support my call for police access to eurodac .
i refer to the establishment of a free trade area across both regions .
i am against implementing such a free trade area .
the real solution lies in the creation of a european public air transport service .
i voted for the european parliament resolution on passenger compensation in the event of airline bankruptcy .
that is why we abstained .
in addition , origin marking is an important step towards producing coherent trading regulations with third countries .
however , it is important to find the right balance from the perspective of producers and consumers .
the transparency offered to consumers must not be created at the expense of the manufacturers .
no additional costs must be involved for small and medium sized businesses .
it is necessary to strengthen the community economy by improving the competitiveness of eu industry in the global economy .

electronic communication and the internet have become the main tools of our modern societies .
in particular , we have the revised framework directive for electronic communications networks and services .
we would like to offer our congratulations .
the package strengthens competition and the protection of consumers in europe .

enlargement strategy 2009 concerning the countries of the western balkans , iceland and turkey debate 
this is , if anything , an understatement .
our magnetism is still there .
their door to our union might sometimes be a very distant one .
this is an area where our union must also be more present and engaged in the future .
i would also like to thank all of you for your excellent cooperation over the past five years .
the eu will take a long awaited step forward next week when the lisbon treaty enters into force .
as your draft resolution illustrates , enlargement is one of the eu's most powerful foreign policy tools today .
icty cooperation remains a must .
the former yugoslav republic of macedonia has made convincing progress recently and substantially addressed the key reform priorities .
respect for human rights is a founding principle of the european union .
we identify eventual visa facilitation and trade as flagships once the conditions have been met .
let us keep that dream alive and , in time , make it a reality .
we hope to see the negotiations with croatia concluded as early as possible next year .
we hope for new dynamics in the negotiation process with turkey including opening of the energy chapter .
and we believe that the eu can keep up the momentum reinforcing the positive developments in all enlargement countries .
nor should you think that we are indifferent to the absorption capacity of the european union .
on behalf of the ecr group . mr president , the ecr group strongly supports european enlargement .
we should not be denied the possibility of criticising islam .
but turkey is showing its true colours here .
let us be honest with the turks .
the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under rule 149 8 
however , it is also important to explain that the copenhagen criteria apply .
the european perspective must be correct in order for the internal reform processes to start .
here , I would single out turkey , in particular .
we should offer ukraine a clear possibility of membership .
it is very disturbing to see how particular countries have so easily allowed russia to manipulate them .
to do this , it is not enough to meet the copenhagen criteria and merely confirm them formally .
nl we have to stop putting on this great pretence where the accession of turkey is concerned .
we must stop obscuring and minimising the problems .
we all need to be brave enough to face the reality .
just now , mr bildt said that he rejects the idea of a closed europe .
there are , of course , outstanding questions .
we need institutional reforms .
these figures speak for themselves and no politicians can or should deny them .
let this be our enlargement strategy for 20this has already been discussed today in plenary .
as an accession candidate , turkey is already receiving eur 2.26 billion for the period from 2007 to 20this is obviously all about us interests .
of course , many of us are deeply concerned about migration problems in relation to our nations .
that is what it is about .
this situation is unstable , untenable and unsustainable .
i endorse the ideas that we have identified as the guiding principles of the enlargement process in recent years .
i mean consolidation , conditionality and communication .
secondly , progress in the various accession processes is subject to strict compliance with the conditions .
thirdly , we must all make an effort to communicate with the citizens .
the resolution we are to vote on tomorrow highlights the very important issue of communication .
i am about to conclude .
i would like to offer my very warm thanks to mr rehn for his courage .
mrs pack obviously did not hear me when I said that we are standing by thessaloniki .
it would be much better to have turkey joined to europe by a bond of privileged partnership .
i agree , but we must consider that turks are turks .
in other words , full adaptation is required for full integration .
within this framework , the application of good neighbourly relations is very important .
it is with these thoughts that we shall decide on our stand in the vote tomorrow .
i hope his legacy will be the accession of all current eu candidate countries .
a lot of the work is already done .
you do not want to understand that and you will never understand that .
everyone must do their bit , including those in the european union .
bullying a neighbouring country is never helpful .
however , the majority of proposed amendments indicate that this is a complex subject .
however , we have adequate instruments for monitoring compliance with accession conditions .
madam president , I am very grateful for this opportunity to share a few thoughts with you .
the acceding states must undergo a thorough transformation in order to meet the requirements of eu membership .
the process , it should be stressed , is voluntary .
this is the message that the albertini resolution is sending to prospective candidates for eu membership .
president in office of the council . madam president , let me try to be brief .
i did listen to the debate .
you are not part of one of the major groups .
it does not happen by itself .
our process of enlargement , as everyone has been pointing out , is performance based .
it did apply to sweden once upon a time , and we managed .
applause from the centre left 
could I just finally pick up one of my favourite items .
i do not like the word .
i do not see our union asabsorbingnations .
and I do not know if france wants to be absorbed .
that is true .
together we have made a difference .
i believe that it is extremely important for the european parliament to be involved in evaluating the enlargement process .
this process has been a major success for the european union , bringing it peace and stability .
it must start to honour its commitments immediately , otherwise it will not come through evaluation in december unscathed .
we should also remain clear about the relevance of the copenhagen criteria .
from this point of view , the application of iceland for eu membership is a logical step .
it is high time that we began speaking honestly and clearly .
i am confident that member states will give their blessing to this decision this very month .
serbia has made particularly significant progress recently .
during my work , I think I have used every possible word to describe the situation .
i think I have used very many words we have done so together in this fight .
now I feel that we actually need to see some concrete action .
this is a type of violence that robs women of their human rights .
putting a stop to all forms of gender based violence is a fundamental element of a society of equality .
male violence against women is a clear indication of the unequal power relationship between women and men .
existing treaty provisions contain an obligation to work towards equality between women and men .
when does the commission intend to organise a european year against violence against women ?
the council has raised the problem of violence against women on several occasions and in several different contexts .
i would like to start with something positive .
we have made progress , but , of course , much more needs to be done .
the beijing platform for action provides us with a structure and a long term agenda for international gender equality policy .
the problem of violence against women knows no national boundaries .
we need to tackle this at international level , both within and outside europe .
i am grateful to parliament for raising this issue today .
this is why I would like to add a few words on this point .
this idea has been approved by un secretary general ban ki moon , and I am very proud of that .
madam president , I would like to finish on a personal note .
it is therefore a topic that must be tackled on different fronts .
it is therefore my wish for all of us that our cooperation will grow ever stronger .
violence against women is a major social issue that cannot simply be reduced to a women's issue .
we cannot simply remain passive spectators .
none of the eu's member states are succeeding in addressing these problems on their own .
zero tolerance towards all forms of violence against women must become a top priority of all institutions throughout europe .
it is not only an equality issue .
its effects are both insular and outgoing and destroy lives .
the road to rebuilding these lives is long and needs support .
it is an area which we as a society can no longer afford to ignore .
let me stress again this is totally unacceptable .
there can be no reason , no argument and no scope for understanding .
some women are murdered simply because they are women .
i could also mention education for equality , combating stereotypes and legal aid for victims .
more women die from the aggression directed against them than die from cancer .
as we debate these extremely serious matters , women are being assaulted .
he did it one night he did it while she was sleeping .
honour killing is a hideous crime and we must do everything we can to combat it .
it has already been mentioned that rape can be used as a weapon of war .
this is not just a problem for women .
we must , therefore , continue to stress that violence against women is neither natural nor unavoidable .
budgets linked to these policies have exploded .
yet violence against women is not in decline .
it is linked to discrimination based on gender .
this initiative and activity has been called for by many of you in parliament .
i would like to reiterate that violence against women is a priority area for the swedish presidency I would like to express my thanks for this extremely important debate .
but it is also the truth .
one of the members gave the example of the woman who did not want to wear a burkha .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday , 26 november 200written statements rule 149 
in writing . today is the international day for the elimination of violence against women .
over 120 women have been murdered since 1996 , a significant number by a partner or ex partner .
for victims , creating shelters is not enough .
the european socialists have long been calling for effective protection and for good programmes .
however , we must nonetheless admit that violence is also a problem .
it is a problem unworthy of a civilised society , a problem which undermines human dignity .
a political solution with regard to the piracy off the somalian coast debate 
in spite of what I have said , there is no room for complacency .
there are currently 75 suspects being held in kenyan jails .
we need to sustain the operation , and the support of the parliament is very important in this respect .
the new contribution agreement of eur 60 million has just been finalised .
the programme is implemented through the unodc at a cost of eur 1.75 million .
a regional information sharing centre in sanaa , yemen , has also been identified for funding in 200the first phase of this programme has already started and technical feasibility studies are launched .
that is why we should increase the protection offered to vessels of this type .
no , that is certainly not the solution .
what is the overall political concept for somalia ?
we do not understand how this mission can contribute to state building .
that operation is clearly inadequate , however , and must be strengthened .
nonetheless , it is clear that atalanta cannot be the sole mechanism for resolving the somali problem .
the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under rule 149 8 
es mr de grandes pascual , please do not try to bandy words .
el madam president , it is a fact that somali pirates are a threat to international shipping .
pirates have modernised their tactics , as the council has said , at sea and on land .
we condemn any act of piracy , without a doubt .
lastly , the entire community fleet has been duly entered in the iotc regional fleet register .
should we not also build the local police , as well as a core of military forces ?
somalia is a big problem . it has been a big problem for 20 years .
results have been fairly limited .
we are fairly late entrants in this area when it comes to trying to deal with somalia .
when we are discussing extending it out into the indian ocean , we are talking about absolutely enormous areas .
that is what we are trying to do with different training programmes .
is there a guarantee of this being successful ?
then we have to help and protect the boats and all the people there .
somebody asked whether there could be a summit on piracy in the future .
if they have an interest , then they might indeed do so .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 149 
therefore , acting on a long term basis , we must concentrate on 
• resolute maintenance and execution of the arms embargo on somalia ,
many eu member states have now adopted such laws , and several are on the way to doing so .
parliament also considered that the smoke free policy should be complemented by other supporting measures .
the council shares this view .
we cannot ignore the fact that smoking currently remains one of the biggest causes of illness and death .
in fact , this effect was noticed almost immediately after the smoking ban was introduced .
i am a liberal and am virulently attached to this notion of freedom , free choice and free will .
it is a completely absurd situation .
studies have shown that standardised packaging would greatly reduce consumption and demand , especially among young people .
we cannot provide special protection for children by taking action at a european level .
they were furious about the ban .
people have come to live with it .
they are so vulnerable , and it is so sad to see that they are exposed to this danger .
lt here in the european parliament , we often discuss human rights .
i believe that we are all interested in having a clean and healthy environment , especially for our children .
i have no problem with people smoking but it affects others and that is the problem .
passive smoking has basically been eliminated in ireland and adults have also cut back on smoking .
in my opinion , the member states should decide which regulations to put in place to protect non smokers .
the vote will take place tomorrow thursday , 26 november 2009 .
written statements rule 149 
even though the current draft explicitly supports the principle of subsidiarity , it also undermines it .
the motion calls for strict and legally binding regulations at eu level .
i am fully aware of the damage to health caused by using tobacco and by passive smoking .
however , the european union has no direct authority in this area .
composition of committees and delegations see minutes
there is no point in saying that member states have already ratified the core ilo conventions .
this is where the question arises .
in this parliament we hear again and again about exchanging best practice between member states .
for two reasons .
we should be a global pioneer when it comes to promoting good working conditions and decent work .
we should practise what we preach .
we will therefore also support this .
as is well known , the international labour organisation is one of the oldest international bodies .
the eu must take the lead .
the member states of the eu and the eu itself ignore the ilo conventions .
they do not ratify them and they do not implement them .
this allows the member states and the eu to shirk their responsibilities .
this is scandalous and this situation needs to change 90 years after the founding of the ilo .
the ppe group will be particularly vigilant regarding the application of these conventions in the member states .
once more , world food security has been in the spotlight .
for the european commission , the summit was a useful event for three reasons .
the european commission has actively encouraged this reform and is assisting in providing core funding for it .
efforts to achieve production around the world are not enough in their own right .
what has happened since then ?
more than 1 billion people suffer from hunger every day .
however , we share the responsibility for this .
we hope that the new commission and other political groups are prepared to accompany us on this mission .
poverty and dependence on imports are the main cause of food insecurity .
to do this it protected its internal market and supported its consumers .
take zimbabwe , for example , which mr deß has already referred to .
that would make europe grow in stature , and it is urgent !
yet , there is no mention of this in the final declaration .
there are political systems which are significantly worse for human life and the fight against hunger .
so a highly political meeting in economic , social and financial terms was reduced to a run of the mill technical meeting .
having been in your position , I know the difficulties involved in getting donors on board .
it happens in madagascar , for instance .
this seems to be too sensitive for world leaders to discuss .
then there is the common agricultural policy of the eu .
that causes food shortages and brings a need for food imports .
when can we see a free and fair european agricultural policy ?
experts estimate that it would cost usd 44 billion to overcome the scourge of chronic malnutrition .
farmers in northern ireland want to help to meet that need .
we have a moral responsibility and we are prepared to take it on board .
the challenges are long term , but the solutions are urgent and are needed now .
human beings have progressed because we have identified challenges , determined the responses and taken action .
otherwise , we will not manage to meet the millennium development goals .
can I please ask for an example of where this is currently a problem .
hunger is present in the european union as well .
these also include those people representing the average who spend many times more than this on food .
and we have got to save the lives of children .
de madam president , adequate food is a human right and hunger is a crime against humanity .
too little is often said about the first three points .
the cap is not perfect , but it has been reformed .
there have been similar distortions in agricultural policy .
when you look at the final declaration this is , I think , also obvious .
by the way , this facility was an innovation by my predecessor .
the vote will take place on thursday , 26 november 200meat imports from third countries debate 
the next item is the commission statement on meat imports from third countries .
thus , the scope of these rules is much more limited than the rules in force in the eu .
all the measures I have described are fully harmonised .
in any case , the overall findings did not justify any further restriction on imports of beef from brazil .
let us , however , examine the issue more closely .
the growing deficit in european production is naturally being covered by imports from third countries , mainly from brazil .
commissioner , I am not advocating protectionism in any way , but it is time to act .
we cannot stand idly by and let this practice continue .
i have to say to you , commissioner , that we are here for the next five years .
we will not accept second best any more .
before a ban in 2007 , 30 000 premises in brazil exported beef to the eu .
there are grave concerns about unidentified cattle in slaughterhouses .
european farmers must abide by rules put in place for the safety of the consumer .
madam president , I will answer that .
why on earth have we got this situation now , within the european union ?
there are serious questions which we raise and rightly raise in this house about this importation .
let us therefore act accordingly so as to protect our producers , who are the guarantors of this quality .
i certainly would not give them anagrade for their work .
secondly , I am not convinced about your argument regarding brazilian beef .
i went there myself , saw matters on the ground and support previous speakers in this regard .
farmers in the eu conform to the world's highest standards , and rightly so .
however , these imply a level of cost which we cannot pass on to our consumers .
the two points I have made show it to be falling very short .
if traceability is so important for consumer protection , then it must also apply to imports .
as already discussed , I am not interested in partitioning off europe .
beef farmers are not asking for special privileges just a level playing field .
as you are well aware , europe is a net importer of meat .
that applies to the identification and registration of cattle and to animal disease prevention measures in brazil .
commissioner , you also spoke about foot and mouth .
i agree with you that we have indeed taken some steps forward .
what my group and now parliament are asking for has nothing to do with trade restrictions .
we will be calling for this now and in future from the commission .
you can be sure of that .
madam president , the debate prior to this was about hunger .
these two debates are linked .
it is produced as cheaply as countries can produce it .
de madam president , our citizens have high expectations regarding the safety and quality of their food .
our market access conditions are important conditions because they affect food and they affect the health of our residents .
at this point , our exports to russia amount to eur 1 billion per year mostly from ireland .
we applied very strict rules .
i gave you the figures .
that is also what we have asked brazil to do .
problems were identified in brazil .
nevertheless , the brazilian authorities made an undertaking to review the database to avoid incorrect data .
the fvo missions have this in mind when they go . they know that they will find defects .
you can also be assured that our fvo missions to third countries will be very strict .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 149 
the european union's food safety regulations are the most stringent and high level in the world .
however , compliance with these regulations incurs significant additional costs for europe's farmers .
despite this , their significantly lower price makes them competitive in the marketplace .
the subject we are discussing has another aspect .
we should draw conclusions from the critical situation in the dairy market .
opening of the sitting
first , the court gives an unqualified opinion on the accounts for the second year running .
as in previous years , for 2008 , the court gives an unqualified opinion on revenue and on commitments .
the picture for payments , however , continues to be mixed .
the commission has claimed that the correction and recovery mechanisms mitigate the effects of the errors .
this brings me to the fourth and last key message of this annual report .
vice president of the commission . mr president , the commission welcomes the court's annual report for 200i have already had the opportunity to thank the court for the very good cooperation enjoyed again this year .
as you have just heard president caldeira state , the level of irregularity has decreased overall in recent years .
this reduces the risk of error and the costs of control .
we have succeeded in raising the aspirations of everyone involved by the use of this system .
however , 31 % of the budget is still coloured in red .
the commission's lack of strategy for these two countries is causing considerable concern .
mr caldeira mentioned those areas in his speech .
the first area is that of cohesion funds and funds related to regional policy .
we must endeavour to make improvements in this area .
the level of the irregularities is decreasing .
the whole vat dossier continues to cause me concern .
according to estimates , total vat fraud europe wide amounts to eur 80 100 billion .
the court of auditors has made a number of observations on this , too .
i should like to finish off by mentioning the discharge for the other institutions .
this is a huge problem .
the court of auditorsannual report on the 2008 accounts shows no significant improvement .
it is just taxpayersmoney we are dealing with .
it is only the money of people who are now struggling to pay their mortgages and educate their children .
but all this is not enough .
how will it make sure that those eur 4 billion are returned ?
i should like to hear a response to this from the european court of auditors .
there may be very different kinds of conclusions .
firstly , conclusions concerning control methods , conclusions concerning responsibility , but also conclusions concerning future policy .
the management control system is making progress , and we only hope that it will be extended and deepened .
whether it is efficient is another matter .
however , it is now the responsibility of the member states in particular to improve their control systems .
we must implement a policy of naming and shaming .
we would like to support you in this and we would like to add one other request .
i am not sure what this achieves .
i find it shocking that many errors are occurring in procurement with regard to projects .
the fear of doing things wrong in the eyes of the commission is great .
in other words , the commission has been handing countries a bag of money without applying sufficient controls .
the european court of auditors rightly underlines the importance of simplifying the rules .
this represents a step in the right direction in the context of the better lawmaking strategy .
enhanced supervision and control are also needed .
the european commission and the member states must draw up an action plan to this end .
with regard to cohesion spending , there are too many errors .
i would like to reiterate this proposal .
these irregularities relate mainly to excessive payments and the incorrect use of funds .
the final aspect is agriculture .
however , even a clean audit opinion in itself is not enough .
mr president , commissioner , welcome to the new world of the treaty of lisbon .
i would therefore like to thank president caldeira and every member of the court of auditors .
we have to further reduce the complexity at european level .
yet you will be confronted with the bill , commissioner .
we expect the swedish presidency to be ready to discuss this over the next few days and also .
the president cut off the speaker 
we cannot allow any uncertainties when it comes to these .
we now pay out funds based on simple technical requirements .
the president cut off the speaker 
after all , there is strong friction here in the relationship between the european and national levels .
therefore , we do have to name the countries concerned .
quite simply , I do not think this is good enough .
this is my proposal .
i also worry about how we can account for issues like water management , climate change and biodiversity .
de I am reminded of two basic rules from my childhood .
that is my opinion .
however , this is on average and that is precisely where the problem lies .
it is important to name names in this respect .
the funds available for cohesion policy represent nearly a third of the european budget .
as such , we need to be demanding and ensure that the procedures are applied properly .
the first is the institutionspolicy on buildings and property .
madam president , a simple question .
various explanations have been given for this in the debate .
i think the committee on budgetary control always experienced cooperation with you as very constructive .
did the few errors or irregularities identified prevent projects from being completed ?
firstly , one important thing was underlined transparency .
national declarations and the participation of member states need a stronger legal basis .
that is normal life .
what I do not like is that some people deliberately and constantly use incorrect facts .
you should learn about democracy , mrs gräßle .
we will stop there .
however , what does it mean for authors , creative people , artists and publishers ?
what part will they play in the publication of their work on the web ?
does copyright need to be adapted in the digital age ?
do we need to change existing structures ?
authors and publishers want to receive a financial reward for their work .
the interests of consumers are clear .
how can copyright clearance be simplified in the internet age ?
should we perhaps distinguish between literary works and scientific or academic works ?
i would like to consider one last important point and that is once again the subject of collecting societies .
do we still need them ?
i am interested to know what the commission is planning .
this issue is definitely intensive , interesting , exciting and very future oriented .
i will first of all give an overview concerning this concrete question .
but meanwhile , important changes have occurred .
first , the revised settlement has been significantly narrowed in scope .
these are extremely important matters for the committee on the internal market and consumer protection as well .
it was google that scanned millions of copyright titles from all over the world .
both of these categories are very loosely defined .
it will make literature and learning more accessible to the digital generation .
this is a central question and a major necessity .
google books cannot simply ignore all the issues on the basis of an assumption .
an attempt must be made to find the author and to protect his or her rights .
perhaps statutory exceptions are needed in order to provide a relatively effective solution to the problem .
as you said , mr kallas , europe needs to undertake a digitisation programme .
i join my colleagues from europe's right wing parties in totally opposing any exclusive situation resulting in a monopoly .
we can overcome the other major issues concerning intellectual property and compliance with copyright for out of print and orphan works .
legislation can be adapted to accommodate them .
firstly , the conditions which need to be met are , of course , clear .
for we must not , of course , squander this opportunity in europe .
it is plain for all to see that harmonising copyright in the european union has become an urgent necessity .
europeana makes available online nearly five million items .
its mission is to offer the widest possible public access to cultural collections from across europe .
the clear message to all european cultural institutions must be to digitise and to digitise now .
however , we have similar institutionalised instruments in the european union .
hu this is yet another example of our migration from gutenberg's galaxy to the digital one .
we need to avert anarchy and we need to prevent the formation of monopolies .
on a smaller scale , this is what we call piracy .
therefore , our first principle should be that the major players should not be granted any special privileges .
our second principle is that we cannot be dependent on the goodwill of a monopoly .
what if they restrict access to certain books ?
they have a quota of 15 % for books that can be censured .
it started with books the next thing will be works of art in european museums .
this is why it is imperative for europe to devise its own clear strategy in this area .
member states have different solutions here .
in my opinion , the question of out of print works should be harmonised .
we cannot allow a situation to arise in which there is not strict regulation of out of print works .
i think we should adopt broader measures for the european union in this area .
columcille discovered it and got up each night to copy it .
now we need some kind of common approach , for which the commission is very happy to provide proposals .

fao world summit on food security eradicating hunger from the face of the earth vote 
voting time continuation 
oral explanations of vote
i do not see any sign of this progress .
with respect to all this , I am mainly talking about turkey .
this is absolutely appalling .
being subjected to violence in the home is a horrendous violation of personal integrity .
the eu cannot continue to ignore these facts .
this is one hundred per cent a job for nato .
this is in accordance with international obligations arising from the who framework convention on tobacco control .
however , in my opinion ,throughout europedoes not necessarily meanfrom within europe.
today , we can also understand the concern of other public service sectors confronted by the same problems .
fighting the tobacco producers is not the way to reduce smoking .
the representatives of the developed world did not adopt any concrete obligations .
the foundation of solidarity is a willingness to assume real responsibility when meeting with others who are in need .
in writing . the ukip admires volunteering and recognises the contribution to society it can make .
i am in agreement with the rapporteur .
it is offered without charge , and it is generous , freely given and without strings .
indeed , the largest voluntary association in ireland is the gaelic athletic association .
mr president , volunteering represents the expression of european social values such as solidarity and non discrimination .
on the one hand , volunteering offers citizens the chance to learn and acquire new skills and for self development .
in other words , these are precisely the values on which the european union is founded .
europe , which has a long volunteering tradition , must help release the potential this offers .
in this regard , it will surely be wholly beneficial to dedicate the year 2011 to this theme .
the eu is a rock of stability on this continent .
in writing . I voted for amendment christians are still persecuted in turkey and it remains one of our biggest concerns .
in addition , the unresolved conflicts on turkey's borders will become eu problems if turkey were to join .
the motion for a resolution on the european commission's current enlargement strategy is very balanced .
the eu needs to step up its efforts to combat this issue .
how can we explain this phenomenon ?
in writing . I welcome parliament's commitment to this cause .
the state alone must be responsible for these .
for these reasons , the ecr group has chosen to abstain .
leaving the scourge of piracy unchecked will multiply the eu's security concerns in the long term .
the eu must protect maritime vessels passing through this region by means of international negotiations and protection measures .
operation atalanta has succeeded in providing protection for high risk cargos by escorting them .
thirty six pirate vessels have been intercepted and 14 direct attacks have been avoided .
i cannot fail to mention that we still have a hypocritical policy in europe .
they must not be left in any doubt about this .
having said this , I would still like to express two concerns .
firstly , are we heading towards a society that imposes blanket bans ?
what do we do about individual responsibility ?
this is my opinion on item 9 of this resolution .
the deletion was approved , in keeping with the subsidiarity principle in this matter .
the original text of the resolution mixed up and confused the production of tobacco with its consumption .
these two changes have improved the final resolution .
i consider the remaining points positive , so I have voted in favour .
i have never smoked in my life , but I find this constant harassment of smokers completely anti freedom .
the current bans are more than sufficient .
the member states must have the freedom to determine the extent to which they want to protect non smokers .
mr president , I voted in favour , though I would have liked to see a tougher resolution .
fellow members , I can understand the arguments of those who are campaigning against smoking .
the swedish conservatives have today voted against the resolution on the fao world summit on food security .
we are concerned about hunger in the world and believe that a focus on food security is important .
our agricultural policy has been successful in the past , but it has no place in the future .
long term food security is one of the central challenges of the common agricultural policy .
the cap underpins the policy of uprooting small and medium sized farms and supporting the monopolies and their profits .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting see minutes
nicaragua
they return to power only to misuse it once again .
this is entirely inappropriate from the point of view of the content of debates on urgent matters .
the communist experiment was not the answer there , but neither was the neo liberal experiment .
as a member of the fdp , I explicitly reject this claim .
commissioner ferrero waldner took the decision to suspend all budgetary support payments to nicaragua as of 1 january 200this decision had been preceded by a discussion with member states in the council .
the item is hereby closed .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
at the end of september , hundreds of monks from the bat nha monastery were attacked .
major damage was caused to the entire monastery complex while the police simply sat by and watched .
the monks who sought refuge in the nearby phuoc hue temple were beaten up .
this sort of abuse must not be tolerated .
any claims that these people are returning voluntarily are simply not true .
we on the subcommittee on human rights had the honour to meet them recently .
both laos and vietnam must fully comply with international standards in terms of protecting human rights .
applause 
the president asked the member to speak more slowly 
once again , a huge amount of political will is required .
thus , christians are going from being victims to being criminals .
therefore , we should raise the alarm in every instance of drastic violations in this area .
the commission also welcomes the ratification of the convention on disability rights and the un convention against corruption .
however , we have not been able to confirm the information referred to .
let me now turn to vietnam .
is this the way to open doors ?
no .
in the case of violation of workersrights , those criticisms are virtually non existent .

mr president , in recent years , china has seen huge economic growth .
the principles of this resolution are ones I share .
why submit a resolution which may potentially damage the beginnings of a new relationship with the chinese government ?
de mr president , it was said that this was a speech on behalf of our group .
china should be put under pressure .
the people's republic of china is the country which carries out the most executions in the world .
several days ago , we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall .
china is a powerful player on the world stage .
this must not only be included in the constitution , it must also be put into practice .
i would like to state explicitly that this is an intolerable situation .
we want to discuss this in a debate on the eu china summit and to summarise it in a resolution .
this is why the mishmash that has come out of this has nothing to do with urgent issues .
the group of hungarian meps from transylvania also proposed this issue for discussion .
we would like the death penalty to be abolished everywhere .
the primacy of economics continues to be victorious over values and human rights .
of course , abuse of the death penalty is a horrible crime , but there are also arrests .
the same is also true for the respect of the rights of ethnic minorities .
i would like to recall some essential elements that the eu position encompasses .
we have always supported the dialogue between the chinese authorities and the representatives of the dalai lama .
up to now , this has not materialised .
the debate is closed .
these activities were all conducted in secrecy .
there is cause for that now .
the most important project relates to the reduction in incidences of violence .
ideally , they will also be able to prevent recruitment by the taliban very effectively .

the next item is the one minute speeches on matters of political importance .
the first step in this matter should be taken by the european council .
president chávez has closed down thirty radio stations and some television channels .
its objective must be to reduce the existing economic and social disparities , but in different regions of europe .
i would like to warn you about the non interventionist policy of the turkish government .
there are 500 000 tonnes of nuts stored by the turkish public body for nut purchasing .
this programme regards the extension of the schengen area as a priority for the european union's internal policy .
almost six months have passed , and parliament has still not found time to condemn this coup .
what has happened in honduras is extremely regrettable !
the progress report says one thing and mr erdoğan says another .
this is the message which I wish to convey and which I wish to impart to commissioner boel .
firstly , the opposite principle to secularism is not religiousness and still less spirituality .
mr president , please write to the tunisian authorities to request the release of taoufik ben brik .
we have a partnership agreement with tunisia which contains many provisions relating to democracy and human rights .
we cannot remain silent .
human rights defenders in tunisia are being scorned , arrested and humiliated .
there have recently been intensive and generally positive developments in the region .
it is up to them to make use of it .
that will be a great day and an opportunity for celebration .
let us not give in to unfounded fears .
it is also possible that this example could encourage the other un countries to take the same action .
the government has published the implementing provision , which not only overrides laws , but also introduces further restrictions .
operators that do not have a public service mission will , from now on , face increased competition .
secondly , I would like to make the comment that children require protection .
however , the state of israel's policy is a separate matter to anti semitism .
i assume that the european parliament will vigorously oppose any tendency towards anti semitism .
infringement proceedings are currently being brought against the portuguese state .
this form of taxation affects approximately 18 000 farmers in relation to 5.3 % of their sales .
i am sorry but those are just the rules .
i am very sorry that not everybody could take the floor .
i do not think we should speak in such a way .
the next item is the commission statement on the crisis in agricultural sectors other than the dairy sector .
mr president , if you would allow me , I shall just go through some of the different sectors .
to summarise , I see some timid signs of recovery .
i am sure we will come back to these important issues as well .
the fact is that other farming sectors are also affected by this .
for centuries , our farmers have produced food without keeping vast quantities of records .
our farmers hardly dare believe this anymore .
the next few years will be crucial in terms of where our agriculture is heading .
we need reliable planning in agriculture , and agricultural policy must be sustainable .
that is something that we have also advocated for a long time .
to talk of climate protection , but still continue along the path of industrialisation cannot be the answer !
therefore , we , as parliament , must take our job very seriously over the next few years .
the mid term review brought us many changes , and we are about to embark on even more .
we need to look at both these sectors , at how we are actually supporting them .
can we do more for them ?
unfortunately , this currently only occurs on a limited basis .
livestock farming is also facing a huge crisis .
this will raise a question mark over food supply security in europe .
the current situation is particularly alarming for livestock farmers , pig farmers and producers of fruit and vegetables .
this is the level below which a family is deemed to be living in poverty .
let us make sure we take it .
our farmers deserve it , because they are the ones who produce what is required to feed us .
this problem will resurface again within a year or so .
this situation has demonstrated the imbalance that exists between those in the agricultural and food sector value chain .
the last financial year was one of the worst of the decade .
crises only become disasters if nothing is done about them .
the agricultural crisis of 2009 is having a much more detrimental effect on farms than the indices reveal .
it will also affect their ability to spread slurry , and just the general losses that they have .
i would also encourage the commission to look at the potato industry in northern ireland .
i am convinced that such a sensitive sector as food production is in particular need of market instruments .
let us always think about how severe the consequences have been of the liberal measures implemented just recently .
let us learn from these examples so that we do not make the same mistakes again .
all these increase the costs which their competitors do not have to contend with .
thank you , mr kelly .
es mr president , the situation in the agricultural sector is not only of concern .
moreover , for agriculture in the most remote regions , the future is not only uncertain but extremely worrying .
this is causing ever greater problems for our farmers .
however , in parliament , it is our job to demonstrate our new role to our farmers .
that is certainly not the case .
we actually have a safety net in place in situations where the farmers need support .
on the measures we can actually use all the tools that we have available at the moment .
the debate is closed .
these problems are seriously affecting their income .
how will the commission ensure that the core negotiations are focused on development ?
but , of course , we can conclude the doha round only if all wto members are on board .
that is the ultimate deadline .
apart from doha , the ministerial conference addressed some important issues for wto members .
so I expect this to go forward .
this is a step backwards .
the european union must therefore adopt a clear position .
it is on this basis that each of the following points of discussion must be considered 
and
on services protecting the right of every country to continue to regulate its public services .
there are four lessons that can and need to be learned from these experiences .
now we need to bring the negotiations to a conclusion .
now !
it is therefore vital to join forces in order to bring the round to a conclusion .
i do not see any alternative to doha .
in the meantime , however , the negotiations have failed twice .
we cannot behave as if we can carry on in the same way .
looking at geneva , I can only say that the world trade organisation conference has failed in this task .
despite all assurances , the opportunity that a gathering of the states might bring was lost .
might you work towards a solution ?
is this the economic development model that europe should be proposing to europeans ?
it is unacceptable , because it is illogical , to separate trade negotiations from monetary negotiations .
the eu's trade with china is responsible for half of this trade deficit increase .
the new wto regulations are only acceptable if they also integrate climate protection aspects .
blame the crisis .
de mr president , we need a revolution in democracy .
the european union has supported this flexible approach .
written statements rule 149 
ladies and gentlemen , trade can be the basis for lasting and fair development .
the fact is , the wto's work is crucial to the global economic recovery .
sweden has applied for eur 9.8 million from the fund for this .
it is largely down to the fact that the fund has significant resources at its disposal .
mr president , unusual times call for unusual measures .
europe's action is rightly aimed at preserving expertise and skills .
if we wish to achieve these objectives , we must seize the opportunities now .
however , this represents a piecemeal approach .
that is something positive that the european union does for its citizens .
i am grateful that the focus here is on small and medium sized enterprises in particular .
i think it is good that this eur 5.7 million is being made available .
again we have to decide , unfortunately , over three unconnected and very different cases .
de madam president , I would like to use the blue card simply to rectify one point .
exports have paved the way for new businesses and large enterprises to emerge .
these wide ranging changes leave their mark right through society and we should never try to prevent them from happening .
however , we need to make the transition easier for those who are affected .
however , we would like to emphasise that we cannot carry on like this in the future .
the existing procedure must be simple so that states and beneficiaries can gain easy access to it .
this is why I believe that the procedure must be simple .
a number of anomalies have been mentioned and I am going to repeat them very briefly .
firstly , I think the start date needs to be looked at .
madam president , I do not need to add anything to what the commissioner said .
i therefore think that this clarification is an important one .
this is a debate on microfinance and not on the progress programme .
this progress is reflected to a considerable extent in the amendments proposed today .
the proposal for microfinancing is an initiative that parliament has been pushing for .
that is the current situation .
this is the case , for example , in hungary for more than 90 % of firms and enterprises .
madam president , I am rather surprised .
the negotiations were held in appropriate conditions .
the issue of funding is more serious .
such credits can help people to get out of a crisis if they are capable of doing so .
micro credits are also an important instrument for supporting the social economy .
the european roma information office alone gets 50 % of its funding from progress .
in this form , we will reject this programme .
the lack of a strategy to return ships to national colours is extremely dangerous .
the commission proposal is to reallocate eur 100 million for this finance facility out of the progress budget .
such an approach is not responsible , and it is unacceptable .
private capital has also dried up .
in these circumstances , it is usually micro enterprises and young entrepreneurs that suffer the most .
i call upon my fellow members not to hesitate in taking the decision to establish this microfinance programme .
i therefore welcome this new financing instrument for people who want to go self employed .
i think we can neutralise this risk with this financing .
thus , there is no other way but to find additional funds for microfinance facilities .
the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under rule 149 8 
that is two thirds !
should the instrument be financed from progress yes or no ?
this is not about a begging hand .
at the practical level , it is possible to move from a temporary strategy to a long term strategy .
the president cut off the speaker 
initial small investments are easier to cope with than to pile up large mountains of debt .
women want to grow with their businesses .
particularly during the economic crisis , the necessary liquidity needs to be provided to the population at large .
i welcome the idea presented in the commission proposal .
questioning the jurisdiction of european policy is certainly permissible in this area .
the proposal will facilitate investments of low sums and will give micro enterprises an opportunity to grow .
my conclusions are as follows .
this constitutes a functional barrier for people who do not speak any of these languages .
i think a review of the principles of the promotional campaign is called for .
the member states must also take appropriate precautionary steps in this regard .
i believe that the commission's future solution to seek agreement together with the european parliament is absolutely essential .
at the same time , the debate has indicated the possibility of compromise in some areas .
however , it is also very important to make use of time .
thank you for the supportive remarks and comments .
we are unable to find any other kind of resources .
the codecision procedure also means that everyone , each party , must take steps .
at any rate , I consider that this programme is extremely important from a social inclusion perspective .
the next item is the statement from the commission on toy safety .
the first is a question that is very easy to answer .
the second question is simple , too .
this proposal was put forward by germany .
this view was also shared by the council and by parliament .
there have been indications twice this year that new findings may be available .
the second case is rather complicated and difficult to explain .
the scientific committee is looking into this .
these are technical issues that are extremely complex .
it is also full of examples of so called minority opinions ultimately proving to be correct .
the content is defined in terms of the smallest measurable content .
as regards the limit values , a similar appeal was made a year ago as you mentioned .
i tried , back then , to obtain more scientific opinions from germany and I have since received these .
children ask for toys in these letters .
i have listened to him heaping blame on scientists .
these relate directly to the christmas market .
the debate on toys and safety should really be held throughout the year .
these substances can be avoided .
we have a huge responsibility to ensure that our children are not made unwell or put at risk .
when can we expect a standard stating maximum noise levels for toys ?
once again , we were told that this would be resolved via standardisation .
it is a question of the protection of our children .
allow me to make a preliminary comment .
i cannot do that and neither can you .
not one of you can do that either .
i am sorry , but that is not possible .
i hope that makes it clear .
i do not need the help of the federal institute for risk assessment to find that out .
that is something we can take pride in .
the relevant instructions have been sent to the european standardisation organisations .
you cannot expect them to be available in a week or in one , or indeed several , months .
it takes time .
written statements rule 149 
agenda for next sitting see minutes
oral questions tabling see minutes
the next item is the joint debate on the following 
we got started immediately on formulating parliament's political expectations and directives .
we knew that europe's economy was in crisis .
at the same time , we also had to face the fact that we had insufficient room for manoeuvre .
most importantly , there is sufficient support for everything in this chamber .
staff at the institutions have themselves begun to come forward with information and suggestions .
this is where we are now .
the 2009 budget is also making a significant contribution to this solution .
i hope that we will all work towards this .
of course , it was not an economic recovery package .
this agreement serves two different , but equally important , purposes .
i would like to thank the rapporteur , mr böge , for endorsing the results of the conciliation .
mr president , I would like to say a big thank you to everyone involved .
in this regard , I have a direct question for the swedish presidency .
there are barely any margins left .
i would be very grateful for your thoughts on this .
are there any programmes that are not working very well ?
in my group , we do not advocate the contravention of existing agreements .
it is several years now since the kinnock reform . it is five years since enlargement .
we have already heard about the political symptoms .
therefore , I will now move on to the questions concerning the forthcoming review .
this was a motto coined by mr surján .
in this context , crisis refers to both the financial crisis and the economic crisis .
there is one thing that I would like to add .
we must also change our agricultural policy and our agricultural export subsidies dramatically and focus on the structural funds .
these must also undergo significant change with regard to the restoration of old buildings and sustainable transport policy .
what is it that I want to say ?
the 2010 budget represents a step in the right direction , but it is by no means enough .
half a billion euros is supposed to be spent on mitigating the negative impact of globalisation .
it was a sign of bad planning .
many meps are concentrating on pet projects and pork barrel spending .
that proposal appears to come from another planet a planet where there is no financial crisis .
parliament welcomes the increase in administrative expenditure an increase which also includes memberssalaries .
in the current circumstances , we should renounce any increases .
colleagues , listen to your conscience and vote against this budget .
energy security , both now and in future , is an important issue at a european level .
bulgaria has decided to close the kozloduy nuclear power plant immediately .
for me , three things are important in this area .
in my view , however , the big news of the day is not this agreement .
they are reinventing the european budget , but in a kind of parallel form .
the focus is on two budget lines competitiveness and the environment .
this budget line will be allocated about eur 65 billion for next year .
these account for approximately 35.5 % of europe's total budget .
55 % of member states are under this average .
i welcome the fact that the milk fund has been established .
in this context , the council has forced the european parliament to set priorities .
this is a successful set of priorities .
it should not be necessary to mobilise the flexibility instrument to make up for the shortfall in funds .
finally , I continue to oppose the colossal waste that is commonplace in all the european institutions .
for this , I would particularly like to congratulate the commissioner .
the truth is that today we can consider this to be a success .
hidden underneath all this celebration , however , is a much less pleasant reality .
the new needs cannot be funded by cutting back on the current priorities .
the answer isno.
my answer goes without saying .
we are going to have to move over to a system of own resources no matter what .
i also take the view that we need to do much more to halt the decline in world biodiversity .
essentially , this permanently excludes the potential for an independent eu foreign policy .
he said that the commission was raiding the main areas .
what are the costs of the treaty of lisbon ?
they have become our sacred cow .
up to the end of 2009 , at least eur 602 million was spent on kozloduy .
plans have simply been made for managing the decommissioning process .
however , our margins are dwindling .
parliament can be proud of the 2010 budget .
i would like to congratulate the rapporteurs for this , mr surján and mr maňka .
beyond these remarks , which have been made very effectively , I should like to stress two points .
i should like , firstly , to ask a question and , secondly , to adopt a political position .
we have achieved this ourselves in our committee and I attach great importance to this .
this budget marks the absence of a global vision for europe .
thank you mr gallagher .
mr president , I should like to make four points .
in addition , unemployment is set to reach a record high in member states .
however , I wish to draw member statesattention to their responsibility in accessing european funds .
i would like to emphasise one further last point .
i have five observations to make .
the second point is the inclusion of eu staff pensions in the budget .
i wish to thank everybody involved in this process .
we have not achieved everything , but I am pleased we have achieved so much .
we should make sure that the budget in the future meets our priorities .
at the moment , that amount is not enough .
our budget should follow our priorities , but it should also follow the priorities of our citizens .
they have done what they have done for years .
i think that this would be an important public service .
there is a sort of growing belief that there is a faceless bureaucracy .
perhaps I should stress that is in an ideal world reality is often different .
everything else becomes secondary .
pl ladies and gentlemen , the budget for 2010 is a difficult compromise .
this will improve our competitiveness .
it seems we still spend too little on education , including the erasmus exchange programme .
mr president , briefly , I want to stress one thing as the commissioner is here .
my understanding is that there is no room for this proposal , but the situation has to be qualified .
fortunately , transferring all power to the european parliament is probably not what our voters want .
i received a direct question from mr färm .
however , they are key people .
i would like to thank them all .
we have all achieved this by spending every last penny of the resources received through the multiannual financial framework .
if there are resources available for creating new jobs , the number of jobs will actually increase .
the joint debate is closed .
this means that hard earned taxpayersmoney has , for years , been trickling away into mysterious channels .
the 2010 budget is very carefully balanced as it makes full use of all the opportunities for allocating expenditure .
voting time
for details of the outcome of the vote see minutes 
these facilities have been squeezed out by local government and other state microfinanced facilities .
i believe that it should be our duty to increase this financial resource .
i therefore welcome the commission's proposal and parliament's work on this subject .
this is a way to encourage entrepreneurship and raise the levels of employment and social inclusion .
this microfinance facility is complementary to other programmes that support employment and inclusion .
when an economy or jobs are at stake , it is crucial to stimulate growth with substantial investment .
the overwhelming majority of employees in europe are employed by micro , small and medium sized enterprises .
if there was ever a time to take prompt action , it is now .
i am in favour of financing social provisions in order to assist workers who have lost their jobs .
this bears no relation to the europe of the general interest and of social equality that our peoples need .
it is difficult to achieve such goals without this kind of support facility .
this will give disadvantaged sections of the population the opportunity to take out loans and to help themselves .
however , I am calling on the council not to take the funding from progress .
it is important that this programme retains its funding in full .
currently , the financial and economic crisis is changing into a social crisis and an employment crisis .
the member states clearly lack political courage .
i say an emphaticno, then , to this report .

question hour with the president of the commission
can you let us know what timetable you are working to and who is responsible ?
at the same time , the five year period of the barroso commission is coming to a close .
having said that , there are issues that we have to change and to improve .
clearly , then , greece will have to work hard and implement reforms it has not implemented to date .
let us compare the interest rates payable in germany and the united states .
the portfolio responsibilities that you have presented seem to us to have very presidential overtones .
in our opinion , these groups have produced good results during the last parliamentary term .
it seems to us that mrs malmström will be creating a sort of homeland security office .
there will be a lot to do after copenhagen .
she will have a dedicated dg for climate change .
we have to think of innovative ways of financing .
i hope the new commission will put forward some proposals in this area .
this is due to an eu target reduction of 20 % of carbon emissions .
because tata owns corus .
president of the commission . regarding the insinuation you are making , I really cannot comment .
this does have some consequences in terms of the adaptation of our industry .
i am sorry about that .
what I can tell you is that the member states take their own decisions on this matter .
applause 
in other words , the stick and carrot approach is not enough to guide the member states .
president of the commission . thank you for your question and for the intention behind your question .
i think now we have an opportunity to do it .
unfortunately , it was not possible .
please excuse my harsh words , but one can almost talk in terms of a mirage .
small and medium sized enterprises are the ones that create jobs .
we started to prepare the list of speakers at 15.00 , when we started this item .
we started to deal with the list at 15.00 .
if any other members would like to add their names , please keep to one minute .
research needs funding innovative businesses need funding world class innovation needs world class funding .
please do not say one thing and do another .
president of the commission . congratulations to cambridge .
i think cambridge is one of the greatest universities in europe and in the world .
we have been supporting this idea , not only in terms of ideas but in terms of funding .
should you not make the fight against the scourge of poverty and exclusion the centrepiece of the 2020 strategy ?
which question do you prefer the first or the second ?
mr president , in fact I put three points , and threeyeseswould do !
laughter 
let us see if we agree on this matter .
pl commissioner , implementation of the lisbon strategy is not going very well .
we should treat our social partners a little more seriously .
i would like to underline that point .
they reflect the confidence in a particular economy and the international economic community is affected by them .
i personally think that to have an overall target for all member states is probably not very realistic .
this is my personal thinking .
this was our third question hour with the president of the european commission .
the first 30 minutes were with the other group leaders .
mr barroso , you are on a good enough salary , sir .
we must decide about that .
last week , the foreign affairs council discussed the situation in the middle east and adopted conclusions .
we are concerned about the lack of progress in the peace process in the middle east .
we have therefore made clear our support for the efforts by the united states to achieve peace .
we have fulfilled this promise .
the policy of closure is unacceptable and counterproductive .
i would like to say a few more words about gaza .
it goes without saying that this would have extremely positive repercussions in the whole region .
i will not dwell on the conclusions or repeat what the presidency has said .
the eu is addressing these issues at political level , through diplomatic channels and in our public statements .
another aspect of concern , of course , is the situation in gaza .
all issues should be on the table including the status of jerusalem as the future shared capital .
they should also take place within an agreed timeframe with effective mediation .
it is time to turn this into a reality by closely coordinating our positions and strategy .
the quartet needs reinvigoration the current stalemate in the peace process demands it .
a multilateral framework should complement the israeli palestinian bilateral framework .
this is all about a common foreign and security policy .
a few days ago , we were in the us having discussions with our colleagues from congress .
we have great sympathy for the situation in israel .
first it was stopped and then it was included in the national priority programme .
what does israel have to hide ?
indeed , the rocket fire increased and , in 2009 , israel invaded the gaza strip .
now , israel has announced a temporary halt to construction on the west bank .
a series of roadblocks has also been removed .
mahmoud abbas seems to be a paper tiger , no longer wielding much influence to speak of .
around 500 000 settlers are living in these settlements today .
it is now obvious that the israeli government is using talks to gain time .
this is an established european formula , is it not ?
mr president , the eu heads of mission report on east jerusalem makes pretty devastating reading .
let us not beat about the bush .
this report makes clear that what is going on in east jerusalem amounts to a form of ethnic cleansing .
why shouldn't they we are so gullible we actually pay the bills for the occupying power !
de mr president , I would like to welcome baroness ashton to her new position .
on this basis , I have two questions .
firstly , the courageous report by the swedish presidency , which you just mentioned , mrs malmström .
yes , freedom for gilad shalit , but also for salah hamouri !
therefore , I congratulate the council .
the decision of the council of europe represents a considerable step forward , but we need to act immediately .
furthermore , israel is the only democratic country in the middle east .
this shows what the palestinian administration and hamas think about the european union .
they have no respect whatsoever for our principles or our values .
last week , our delegation was refused entry to gaza by israel .
nevertheless , these conclusions lack specific operational options .
as consumers , we do not want to subsidise the price of conflict .
as cecilia malmström has said today , the status of jerusalem should be negotiated bilaterally by israelis and palestinians .
no reference is made in the conclusions to this group which , unfortunately , is politically important .
what lies behind this ?
jerusalem a sacred city for three religions , the capital city of books , an open capital .
what interests and what actions are we likely to take if the single state option becomes a reality ?
it is a serious report .
they will form the basis for the eu's work for a long time to come .
in order to put an end to this conflict , a negotiated settlement must be reached between the parties .
we cannot accept a solution that is determined through unilateral measures , which then becomes a fait accompli .
i believe what is significant about the council conclusions is that they are very clear .
they give me a real sense of the direction that we need to move in .
the nuances are important .
one is the rather political issues that you quite rightly raise .
what is our relationship to be ?
that is the most significant and practical thing I need to do first of all .
written statements rule 149 
the solution proposed by the council is fair .
it can encourage the resumption of an israeli palestinian dialogue within the context of the union for the mediterranean .
restrictive measures affecting the rights of individuals following the entry into force of the lisbon treaty debate 
this deprives them of not only their right to information but also their right of defence .
i advocate transparent procedures and due legal process for everyone .
i have not heard one single word from the previous speaker .
something must be done otherwise , I cannot follow the debate .
the measures taken as part of the fight against terrorism must be proportionate , appropriate and effective .
the first decade of the 21st century is coming to an end .
we cannot allow terrorism to develop and we must find a firm and appropriate solution to it .
however , the european union must punish those responsible .
does that mean that it has to forget its most fundamental principles ?
this means that the court can examine whether a decision regarding sanctions is lawful .
however , that is how we interpret the treaty .
restrictive measures entail the restriction of certain rights for those individuals that they are directed against .
therefore , the sanctions clearly must respect human rights and the fundamental freedoms .
secondly , article 215 applies when there is a common foreign and security policy cfsp decision .
we were also asked to provide information on fundamental rights related improvements in the work of un sanctions committees .
that is the position that I wanted to set out here , mr president .
these fundamental rights are important .
they can include , for example , freedom of movement , but also protection of property .
on behalf of the efd group . mr president , like charity , rights begin at home .
with them was a leading sikh I have come to know .
we must pursue those people to the ends of the earth and restrict them as much as possible .
the taliban , as far as I know , have no ambitions beyond their borders .
furthermore , wars against muslim countries only provoke terrorist outrages .
there is no possibility of drawing up a definitive and inclusive list of its operatives .
however , the council has sole authority in this area .
let us look at one aspect at a time , starting with the proposals relating to zimbabwe and somalia .
that is all for now .
so my question is this what range of information will be communicated to parliament ?
sanctions and respect for human rights and legal certainty are not mutually exclusive quite the contrary .
this is what both we and the commission clearly understand the treaty to state .
vice president designate of the commission . mr president , I will be brief .
the vote shall take place tomorrow .
we have a register of documents .
it says that we need to further enhance democracy .
we have come quite a long way in our eu institutions when it comes to transparency .
the meeting took place on the initiative of the swedish presidency .
i think this is the last possibility or opportunity that I will have to say thank you to you .
you are indeed the face of the fight for this particular regulation and for openness and transparency in parliament .
that is not always easy .
we all agree that this is a most welcome development .
this issue was addressed by the commission in our communication on 2 december this year .
we do not have a legislative resolution and we do not have the position of the new parliament .
but I think when it comes to openness and transparency , you should not rely on santa claus .
i think it is really up to us to deliver now parliament , council and commission .
what answer does he want from the commission and the council ?
you have tried to bypass us .
the report was and is a dossier in the codecision procedure .
an improved regulation would establish a better level of transparency .
that was what I was told was the outcome of the meeting this afternoon .
this accusation is sometimes made unfairly , but at other times , it does have a basis in fact .
ladies and gentlemen , this debate hinges on a question of trust .
the european institutions are always asking the citizens to trust them .
during the lisbon treaty process , for better or for worse , they asked the citizens to trust them .
the focus must be on citizens .
this strikes me as the only truly clear message .
if anyone is afraid of that , there is absolutely no need to be .
she made a series of accusations .
when they have not been able to be there , their positions have been faithfully represented to those meetings .
all decisions subsequently taken have been communicated to all shadow rapporteurs and all political groups .
this is a very positive thing .
thank you very much mr cashman and parliament for raising this issue .
the european commission has provided a proposal .
it is the only proposal on the table .
this is the basic message from our side .
that is the main difference , as we see it in the commission .
but they are still very important initiatives .
this is where we will continue .
the debate is closed .
situation in georgia debate 
becoming an established democracy where citizens enjoy fundamental freedoms and human rights will bring major advantages for georgia .
the eu is prepared to provide assistance for this .
the monitoring mission will continue to work with the parties involved .
the transition from incident prevention to measures to promote trust will be important in normalising the situation .
and internally , last year's conflict has increased tensions within georgia .
this is the wording of president saakashvili himself .
preparations for the establishment of a new legal framework for our bilateral relations are proceeding quite well .
the draft negotiation directives include the future establishment of a deep and comprehensive free trade area .
to conclude , we remain deeply committed to supporting georgia in these difficult times .
this leaves the great majority of people in georgia feeling decidedly insecure .
how do you intend to ensure that the european funding is not used for this purpose ?
do you think it is likely that they will be released in the near future ?
we are lecturing president saakashvili on the changes which he has to introduce in his country .
no , it is an act of brutal imperialism .
mr president , when I was still a young boy , my country was invaded by the soviets .
she was abused once more a year ago robbed , beaten and raped .
that is exactly what he says she was provocative!
did she oppose his demands ?
that would be unwise nobody , especially the robber and rapist , may be antagonised or demonised .
the next time , mr rapist is given our special pillmistralto increase his male capacities .
however , time has shown that europe is closely linked to these countries in the black sea region .
the president of the pro russian georgian separatist republic won the election with 59.4 % of the vote .
i refer to the dramatic humanitarian and human situation .
the georgian language is banned in many places .
what the georgian state authority did is a crime against the people of ossetia and abkhazia .
the inhabitants of ossetia and abkhazia do not want to live in the same country as mr saakashvili .
thank you .
therefore , the union must try harder .
last but not least , though , I want to make a request .
it is important that the european union flex its muscles in resisting that unwarranted intrusion .
the geneva talks are the relevant platform .
this is an important point that the eu will continue to emphasise to all of the relevant dialogue partners .
the eu will continue to be very active in this matter .
i thought that many of you knew what we have been doing for georgia .
this is the first point .
the second concerns the economic and humanitarian front , where we are working very closely indeed .
the eur 500 million package was the biggest package I could bring through .
let me also speak about the tagliavini report .
she is a very courageous , independent lady , and I must say she has made an excellent report .
we cannot just ask them to come into the european union if the council is not unanimous on it .
so I would rather hope that this policy , as some have said , is really supported by you .
the sitting was suspended at 19.55 and resumed at 21.00 
some economies were better prepared to withstand the blows of the crisis .
the euro is a point of reference to guide the appropriate strategies for emerging from the crisis .
in order for this to happen , investment is needed .
these are countries which joined the union only recently and which are outside the euro area .
however , at present , they are suffering the harmful effects of this situation .
firstly , the central bank must also provide liquidity to local banks .
now we are speaking about different financial and economic solutions which could change the situation for the better .
we have to discuss the social perspective as well .
eu money should first of all go to save common people , not banks or state bureaucracy .
the example of the baltic states , however , shows that we are in the same boat .
a new social policy has not been fully worked into the macro economics of the european union .
investment by the major capitalist multinational companies and banks in solving the problems caused by the crisis is minimal .
it is therefore right to look for ways to counter this unfavourable economic development .
the terms for gaining access to credit are a fundamental issue .
why are we talking about this region separately ?
for instance , after nearly eight years of incompetent socialist administration , hungary has used up all its reserves .
we must avoid this scenario at all costs .
it is difficult in these times to make cuts .
the commissioner spoke about the salutary role of the euro , but it was surely a joke .
you may laugh , commissioner , but I await your response .
firstly , stable public finances .
secondly , we must support small and medium sized enterprises .
we would definitely need the european central bank's assistance mechanisms to achieve this .
the smaller an enterprise is , the more difficult the access the eu has to it .
our main concern must be to create new jobs , reduce unemployment and emerge from the economic crisis .
they must stimulate the creation of new jobs , while maintaining a long term , sustainable fiscal policy .
cohesion has to be effective .
the countries of central and eastern europe have been affected in different ways by the economic crisis .
all these factors may condemn the countries of central europe .
what do you think about the exchange rate policy ?
is it better to maintain a fixed or flexible exchange rate during a recession ?
hu mr president , influenza strikes down those who have a weak constitution .
therefore , the countries of central and eastern europe need .
these are the various exchange rate mechanisms and many other things .
i am very grateful to you for your contributions and ideas .
do we need to strengthen the european instruments ?
the commission is asking the council and parliament to do so .
i shall continue in my mother tongue .
es I agree .
only this helps us effectively stand against any future crisis .
during previous crises , families were able to save themselves by emigrating or by holding down several jobs .
however , it should be stressed that different countries coped with the crisis with differing degrees of success .
these measures would certainly bring a growth in employment and an improvement in the social situation .
in some cases , even the minimum expected level of coordination , agreement and cooperation was lacking .
now a joint effort is required to strengthen the european union's cohesion .
the impact of the social and employment crisis will be felt most in 20the new member states will definitely be its main victims .
it is very important and the content of the communication is very convincing .
it is important for us to be aware that the hygiene regulations have undergone a paradigm shift .
we should consider whether other methods for inspecting meat would be appropriate .
no major difficulties were identified , but in some areas , there is still room for improvement .
this should further contribute to ensuring transparency and legal certainty .
this information provides essential data to ensure a risk based inspection .
the food hygiene regulation specifies the hygiene rules for meat production .
the next item is the commission statement on european action on victims of terrorism .
the commission has a dual role in this area .
these projects fulfil the objective of increasing the solidarity shown by european citizens towards victims of terrorism .
it intends to support measures aimed at encouraging victims of terrorism to share their experiences .
it must not be forgotten that terrorism is often the result of a phenomenon of indoctrination and radicalisation .
this is confirmed by the adoption of the stockholm programme .
we need to be generous in order to ensure that we do not make terrorism an electoral affair .
totalitarians and fanatics kill , the perversion of the basic values of humanity kills .
here is some incidental , illustrative information terrorism equals victims .
this will also raise awareness among european citizens of the value of those victims .
firstly , the victimspolicy requires public sympathy , recognition and social support for victims .
secondly , it requires swift and effective compensation for the damage suffered .
thirdly , it requires equal treatment for all victims .
seventhly , it requires education and teaching against violence in the population .
ninthly , it requires policies of remembrance so that the victims are not forgotten .
these are the ten commandments that I propose for a common policy for the victims of terrorism .
it is an imperative in order to send terrorists a clear message that we do not forget .
however , vienna has not always escaped unscathed .
we are constantly calling for tolerance in many areas .
they have all been struck by terrorism in a completely indiscriminate and completely unjust way .
europe really must be united in combating terrorism .
you have rightly insisted on swift compensation for these completely undeserved and unjustified acts of suffering .
that is what I wished to say in response to the various speeches .
defence of the principle of subsidiarity display of religious and cultural symbols in public places debate 
the eu institutions are champions of the prerogatives of freedom .
there is therefore no reason for any member state to be concerned .
we cannot explain that to our citizens .
let the judges do their jobs .
i am not speaking as a lawyer , but as a politician .
however , we have a wide range of different models in europe .
this is because they are based on our culture and our religions .
it is possible to mention this without forcing anyone to accept the same faith .
we are proud of our religious freedom .
there is religious freedom in the sense that it is possible for me to decide to be an atheist .
that is acceptable and legitimate and we have fought for this .
this is also legitimate in terms of religious freedom .
this is why it has evoked such fury and aggression among the clergy and right wing politicians .
should we do away with the very name of the red cross ?
therefore , we ought to think about the new and different direction currently being taken by the court .
consequently , even the constitutions of many states contain a reference to christian traditions .
the crucifix is not a sign of imposition .
if it were to be limited or censored , the very foundations of the european union would collapse .
madam president , in recent years , we have witnessed an ongoing campaign to suppress freedom of religious expression .
there are , in fact , families that wish to follow a christian tradition .
there are families that may question that tradition .
i believe that we must remain very prudent when dealing with an issue such as this .
that is where I believe this debate should really take place .
once again , these issues come under the domestic legal system of the member states .
however , this respect is exactly what it is all about .
the answer is quite simple .
otherwise , we will have to seriously consider whether this court actually still has a purpose at all .
agenda for next sitting see minutes
there is no final decision .
so we must wait .
i am thinking about that and taking care about that very strongly .
we believe that those who come here as observers should relinquish their national mandates .
the president of the european council , mr van rompuy , will take up office on 1 january 20we , too , will decide who is invited and in what order .
in addition , I think your remarks are premature .
the european commission is also involved in this .
meanwhile , mr reinfeldt is giving the report of the last six monthsactivity of the european council .
implementing measures rule 88 see minutes
i know that this is not enough .
we can help finance climate action in the developing world .
the ground was literally shaking under our feet .
in the course of only a few months , governments in the eu adopted extraordinary support measures .
i am pleased that the eu managed to convince the g20 to agree on far reaching changes to this policy .
the new rules will reinforce the need for a link between result and reward .
the outcome of the then pending irish referendum was uncertain .
it was not clear whether the treaty of lisbon would be ratified by all member states .
it was not even clear whether it could enter into force during the swedish presidency .
the presidency now had a stable counterpart in the commission to work with .
i am not exaggerating when I say it was a relief when all preparations were finalised on 1 december .
the treaty of lisbon could finally enter into force .
now , the european union will be more efficient .
the high representative will assure coordination in our external relations .
a new era for the european union has begun .
i would also like to thank the commission , and especially josé manuel barroso .
last week's european council was the first time that it has met as a fully fledged institution .
second , action on climate has sometimes been a divisive point for the european council .
we should now be getting the benefits from the investment we have made as the pioneers in this agenda .
together with prime minister reinfeldt , we will do our best for the european union to lead this debate .
we know that the atmosphere at the moment is not easy at copenhagen .
i believe last week's european council left the european union ready to meet the challenge .
it is supporting smes and strengthening social cohesion , without which nothing lasting can be achieved .
in other words , I expect copenhagen not to mislead europe .
to conclude , the ppe group supports the council's guidelines on security under the new stockholm programme .
this is precisely the kind of europe that we , the ppe group , defend and promote .
i would like to begin with the institutional problems that this treaty has created .
that has been the fate of mr reinfeldt over the last few months .
that is what I expect from mr van rompuy , for example .
the swedish presidency has put in a lot of effort .
i will gladly admit that here .
today's press is characterised by pessimism will an agreement be reached or not ?
i believe that we must follow a strategy .
which one , though , ladies and gentlemen ?
i therefore call for a proactive approach .
a sense of purpose must be shown in this proposal .
leadership and I learnt this back in nursery school is primarily achieved by setting a good example .
i will try to observe the time limit .
you will be able to end your mission in two weekstime with complete satisfaction .
i think it was not without reason that in your speech , you did not mention foreign policy .
unfortunately , I am forced , here , to say some severe words .
the last six months of foreign policy have , unfortunately , not put a stop to this .
we spoke about this yesterday during the debate on georgia .
i think that rising russian imperialism is one of the european union's most serious problems .
it is dangerous not only for russia's neighbours , but for the entire european union .
mr president , my colleague , mrs svensson , will speak on the subject of the swedish presidency .
we hope that the next presidency will show more courage .
a few words on sweden , since that was mentioned .
concerning that , we have presented these kinds of figures .
no other player has done anything comparable so far .
politicians and diplomats can negotiate , but we cannot negotiate with science we cannot negotiate with physics .
we also spoke with meles zenawi of ethiopia and others .
we can always have more ambition , and the european union has been showing its ambition .
it is a global problem and we need a global solution .
please tell us the truth .
this was contrary to the eu's negotiating strategy and exasperated a significant number of other european leaders .
you had difficult political issues to resolve and overall you did a good job .
nevertheless , mr reinfeldt , I cannot give your presidency full marks .
its comprehensive jurisdiction is increasing , from the environment to financial policy .
at the same time , you are closing the doors ever tighter .
it has been like a well oiled , efficient machine and yet it never got into gear .
where is the money for the developing countries the specific eur 30 billion called for by parliament ?
they are obstructing our work on climate change .
you have power over this enterprise .
yet our global trading position , relative economic weight and international competitiveness are in jeopardy .
parts of the stockholm programme simply fail to get the balance right .
the people of europe deserve nothing less .
the swedish national administration has lived up to everyone's expectations .
firstly , the matter of transparency and openness .
in any case , the ambitious goal of getting the economic crisis under control could not be achieved .
it is unacceptable for european taxpayershard earned money to end up in the bonus pots of bank managers .
in my view , it is time to stop the accession negotiations and offer turkey a privileged partnership .
despite many problems , the swedish council presidency has done a splendid job .
i would like to thank you and your entire government , mr reinfeldt .
i would like to single out two issues .
i reject the claim that greenpeace is the yardstick for european climate policy .
we must remain realistic !
i would like to express my sincere thanks for this , too .
with regard to the subject of the treaty of lisbon mr schulz is not here at the moment .
what is the point of that ?
i can only reject that argument .
the first thing is the implementation of the lisbon treaty .
a treaty is never enough for solving a problem .
should we call into question the wisdom of enlargement ?
certainly not .
these disparities were already there before , and interdependence is valid not only within the union but globally .
applause 
de mr president , we need a revolution in democracy .
why did you adopt swift at such a late stage ?
please use your future to return to your roots .
what is going on and why is there no common position ?
the european commission criticises this position in an incomprehensible , short sighted and narrow minded manner .
hungary , poland , romania and other former socialist countries have fulfilled their kyoto commitments .
in other words , they want to punish contractual compliance , which hungary has also shown .
i note in particular , in the council conclusions , the reference to a global financial transaction levy .
there is still work to be done .
with the czech republic , or some other great presidency ?
neither should anyone expect to get good marks from mr borghezio .
the two highest posts in the eu have been filled .
on the minus side , I would mention the failure to implement patient mobility .
this is a blemish on your presidency .
the most important event that will be mentioned is the treaty of lisbon's entry into force .
the council presidency has done a good job over the last six months .
sv mr president , building bridges is never easy .
this autumn , we have had both a climate crisis and a jobs crisis to contend with .
reference was then made to a europe of responsibilities and solidarity where immigration and asylum are concerned .
my third point is financial regulation .
i followed both the tampere process and subsequently , in particular , the hague process .
however , certain essential issues have been relegated to secondary status .
within the european union in 2008 , there were 515 terrorist attacks in 11 member states .
secondly , eight million irregular immigrants live within the area of freedom , security and justice .
finally , we can move forward to a europe for the citizen , by the citizen .
i thank the swedish presidency .
i would like therefore to endorse its positions and its decisions .
the financial crisis has revealed the weak points in our financial supervision system .
it is an industry that has had to rely on nephrops .
i do not , however , share the opinion that we have a different union or a new union .
i think we have , at most , a renewed union .
this is very much in the hands of the member states .
to point out the obvious , very many of the member states are below these figures today .
we made it voluntary for the member states to give the resources that they were able to give .
we knew of the importance of having a good link with the european parliament .
thank you very much .
that concludes the debate .
as a lithuanian , I know all too well the challenges that the baltic sea region faces today .
one of these is how best to resolve the urgent and serious problem of protecting the baltic sea environment .
the swedish presidency has faced the economic crisis and financial turmoil with sound , realistic measures .
faced with the worst financial crisis since the 1930s , the eu swiftly adopted special support measures .
i equally welcome the developments in the areas of justice and internal affairs .
the next item is voting time .
for details of the outcome of the vote see minutes 
explanations of vote
oral explanations of vote
in my opinion it is therefore necessary to set out firm criteria .
however , the european globalisation adjustment fund exists and has had money allocated to it .
it would be retained by the eu and then perhaps spent on a much less deserving cause .
for example , exports of road vehicles and cars have fallen by 51.3 % and 59.4 % , respectively .
that spirit is the context for the european globalisation adjustment fund .
volvo cars is a very important employer in western sweden .
another request concerns a construction company in the netherlands .
this amending budget clearly reflects the contradictions in the european union's budgets .
unfortunately , amendments tabled by the confederal group of the european united left nordic green left were rejected .
the wto could manage globalisation better .
the various imbalances in the system of international trade unfairly help to accentuate the asymmetries between the continents .
that will give us a fair trading system of service to everyone .
that is the spirit of the doha development programme .
we have also seen that free trade , in particular , between similarly developed countries , is also beneficial .
in this era of globalisation , an effective system for regulating trade is more relevant than ever .
in the wto negotiations , we need to show greater understanding of others and more goodwill .
clearly , this parliament has chosen to prioritise the rights of suspects over the defence of the nations .
in recent years , more and more liberties have been curtailed in the name of combating terror .

award of the sakharov prize formal sitting 
we in the european parliament will never forget the past .
in europe , we enjoy our daily human right of freedom of thought because of their highest sacrifice .
what is there to say in this regard ?
sakharov rethought the role of human rights and intellectual freedom in the modern world as far back as 196the two key components of resurgent russian citizenship were legal consciousness and historical memory .
in the activity of memorial , these two basic components of russian public awareness have merged into one whole .
we all remember the resolution on european conscience and totalitarianism , adopted by the european parliament in april .
i would like to mention just two examples .
in strasbourg they shrug what can we do ?- and remain silent .
applause 
the prize you are awarding today is awardedfor freedom of thought.
so it was when russia had stalin , and so it was when germany had hitler .
such fear can spread throughout russia .
yet what can stand up to fear ?
this quality , possessed by sakharov to an unusual degree , made him impervious to fear .
freedom of thought is the basis of all other freedoms .
we are proud to receive it today .
the sitting was suspended at 12.30 and resumed at 15.00 
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting see minutes
madam president , the problems facing afghanistan and pakistan are naturally a concern of the whole world .
a lot of attention is focused on afghanistan .
an overall initiative is required .
we all need to do more and to do better .
the result was the eu action plan for strengthening the eu's involvement in afghanistan and pakistan .
there is no need to discuss the election process further .
that is behind us .
we hope that a new government will soon be in place .
we hope that the conference to be held in london shortly will create some momentum .
the eu expects a strong commitment and leadership from president karzai and his government .
next year , there will be significantly greater numbers of international personnel in afghanistan .
that is the only way for the population to regain trust in their leaders .
the international community is there .
we will need to do more and to do better .
support for the electoral system will naturally also be high on the agenda .
however , democracy is currently in a fragile and unstable state .
it is particularly important to follow up the recommendations made by michael gahler , our 2008 election observer .
the pakistani government knows that this must be done .
the eu will develop the strategic partnership with pakistan that resulted from the successful special summit in june 200we want to strengthen democracy and achieve stability .
we need to take further steps in our operations in afghanistan and pakistan .
the commission is raising its development assistance by one third to eur 200 million .
but that is all just the start .
that will help us to build a coherent approach that can serve as a model for elsewhere .
there will be no overnight solution to current tensions but we must make a start to overcoming distrust .
both cases are interconnected , and success on either depends on success on both .
we know that almost eur 1 billion is spent every year there , which is a big sum .
i will focus part of my report on the elimination of the opium poppy through the alternative development strategy .
yet the uk pays gbp 45 million a day into this corrupt institution .
however , removing the taliban from government was not the best way of reducing that production .
that can only mean that military action has a legitimate part to play .
president obama has taken three months to establish a global strategy in response to general mcchrystal's alarming report .
i have two comments in this respect , mrs ashton .
however , the question is not when , but how , we pull out of afghanistan .
because the united states said so , or to deliver that country from obscurantism and violence ?
europe should , for instance , support habiba sarabi , the governor of bamiyan province .
this , of course , includes increasing good governance , strengthening agriculture and integrating former taliban fighters .
i invite those who tell you otherwise to go and see what is going on in that country .
thirdly , a social level must be accepted that is not perfect .
let us not think that our european criteria are criteria that should be adapted to afghanistan .
pt the council says that the situation in afghanistan and pakistan has a direct impact on europe .
is that really the case ?
are we being honest in what we say ?
why are we not financing the trained police officers to prevent them from joining the warlords or the taliban ?
it would not cost much and it would be very efficient .
therefore , what structures do we actually want to set up ?
how do we want to establish the dialogue between the afghan and the pakistani governments ?
these are questions to which we still need answers , and I hope that we will get them .
the same is envisaged by the us in the security sector .
i think not and then we have a problem .
we cannot fail .
as I have said , many important factors are at stake .
vast areas of the country are governed by tribal rule and no longer , therefore , by national law .
it is much more complex than that .
minister malmström , quite rightly , raised the issue of regional cooperation .
they have the greater confidence of the people .
increased development assistance in afghanistan basically means an investment in our own security .
a while ago , the european parliament in brussels held a debate with the iranian ambassador in brussels .
i will answer some of your questions .
mr kasoulides the action plan takes the regional perspective as its starting point .
it is absolutely central .
mr kasoulides is right in saying that we have not given sufficient attention to the drugs issue .
this must continue .
it has emerged that there is very strong leadership in place .
this is going to take time .
we have an enormous amount of work ahead of us .
that is why we need the eu to be committed .
there is always room for that .
the peoples cannot choose thebetter imperialist.
these problems are not limited to security and relate to food , health and education .
belarus debate 
the next item is the council and commission statements on belarus .
mr president , honourable members , the eu's relationship with belarus is not without its complications .
secondly , we are open to the possibility of visa facilitation and readmission agreements between the eu and belarus .
it will take time for belarus and there will be many obstacles along the way .
the global financial crisis is actually providing opportunities for influence .
in the energy sector , the low gas prices are just a memory .
can we then exploit this situation to encourage belarus to change track ?
there is no other way than through dialogue .
we have set out the conditions , and now we must proceed reasonably and prudently .
it could become a crucial factor in opening up and influencing belarusian culture .
the importance of having democratic neighbouring countries is a cornerstone of our security strategy .
the principles of the rule of law must be respected .
dialogue is essential if our demands are to bring results .
however , to encourage democratic progress , the council also extended the suspension of the restrictive measures .
the commission is supporting the idea of the eib including belarus in the bank's new mandate .
the european union is ready to work closely with minsk and support its political and economic development .
why are these issues happening in belarus ?
we believe that this is important and that it must define our partnership in the future .
i therefore find this preventive censure of the italian prime minister very annoying .
it is not the west that needs reforms , but the belarusians themselves .
we should always give attention to this .
they , too , are waiting for this signal .
today , I have another idea .
we will be much obliged to you for this .
naturally , the european parliament will also seek substantive contact with the belarusian parliament .
this is good .
belarus certainly should be supported by the european union in its reform process and also in its democratisation .
i am afraid this will be very difficult .
we are concerned about certain backlashes lately , for instance , the young student who was expelled .
we have had lots of contact with civil society during this year .
they are weak but they are there and they need our support , and that support will continue .
it shows that we are truly committed , we stuck out our hands .
firstly , to ensure there is no backtracking on political prisoners and politically motivated criminal prosecution .
secondly , carry out a thorough reform of the electoral legislation in line with osce / odihr recommendations .
fifthly , abolish or declare a moratorium on the death penalty .
what could the eu do for belarus ?
the commission believes that the most productive approach to belarus will be one based on pragmatism .
our message to belarus is clear .
written statements rule 149 
as a result , the eu was obliged to extend the travel restriction measures .
diplomatic relations between the democratic republic of congo and rwanda have been restored .
military operations are continuing against other armed groups , including the fdlr and the lord's resistance army .
these groups are directly responsible for targeting civilians and for an enormous amount of human suffering .
at the same time , armed groups are re emerging in other parts of the country .
the illegal exploitation of natural resources is a further major problem .
the council is also concerned about the preparatory work and arrangements for the planned local elections .
in this regard , reform of the security sector is crucial to the country's stabilisation .
the conditions in which monuc may operate must also be clear and unambiguous .
at that point , the international community really will have a role to play .
firstly , democracy must be consolidated .
however , congo does not have to be a heart of darkness .
i remember the optimism of 200however , our optimism has turned out to be premature .
the time has come for us internationally to demand an end to these atrocities .
i would like to make seven observations .
the pillaging of resources , as you said , commissioner , is another factor that is exacerbating this conflict .
if they were quartered in barracks , things would no doubt be different .
lastly , I believe that we must revisit the amani programme .
this is crucial , even though , regrettably , it did not want to put a force together .
as always , the question arises of whose security is being defended .
so what is being defended in the congo ?
humanity ?
this change was suspended when the war escalated once again .
the congo mission simply must not turn into some kind of vietnam for europe .
therefore , we should , perhaps , end the eu's involvement in the un mission in africa .
dialogue and engagement are the only roads toward such a solution .
all these incidents have taken place against a backdrop of famine and extreme poverty affecting millions of people .
a rapid response by the european union is therefore crucial .
it is extremely complex .
they are the future of congo .
they did a tremendous job .
we are a european union , totally united .
the perpetrators must not be allowed to go free .
recruitment for these missions is currently under way .
of course , this is only a small contribution .
in such a large country , it is modest .
i am not going to revert back to my initial statement .
we are speaking about tens of millions and even more than eur 100 million initially .
thank you for your question , mr posselt .
the council also stressed that the reform agenda must be continued .
however , further efforts are needed to increase understanding of international standards .
a national minority council for the albanian population of serbia will be set up in the near future .
the region's weak economic and social development presents an obstacle for the ethnic minorities in southern serbia .
i would ask the council to continue to address this explosive situation .
there are still difficulties there .
it is clear that it did wander off the subject a little , but it was very much related .
employment policy is primarily the responsibility of the member states .
thank you for your answer .
one very important aspect of the strategy is the governance method .
i think the open method of coordination has advantages but it needs to be improved .
referring to your question , sir , I am not really sure that I understood it .
i did not refer to any micro authority .
subject negotiations for turkey to take part in joint frontex operations
a number of such arrangements have already been concluded and others are currently under discussion .
in other words , does turkey accept the external borders of the european union ?
negotiations with turkey have just started .
all member states , including greece , are of course kept informed of the discussions .
president in office of the council . vessels have been the subject of questions during question time on numerous occasions .
we have started , but have made very little progress , with morocco , egypt and mauritania .
this is the usual procedure .
they are being followed .
some are more successful than others .
can the council give an update on the negotiations nearing conclusion in copenhagen ?
they are two major issues as you are well aware mitigation and financing .
firstly , deep and ambitious emission reduction commitments by the developed countries by 20it is also clear that more is needed if we want to stay within the 2 ° c warming .
the eu will therefore ask them to increase their efforts further in the context of an ambitious agreement .
so hopefully , an ambitious deal can be struck .
you have been a star performer .
how does the council intend to reach a compromise between such disparate figures ?
some countries have made a mixture .
if so , why ?
if we are to achieve political unity , we need to produce a text acceptable to every member state .
discussions concerning implementation , dates and scope are still in progress and will continue for some time yet .
it is important that this deadline remains in place , precisely because it is in all our interests .
we had lots of working groups within the council .
subject safeguarding the rights of disabled people
disabled people constitute one of the most vulnerable groups in society .
in truth , the lives of our disabled vary incredibly from country to country .
also , a significant number of disabled people are simply unemployed .
all this when disabled people actually account for around 10 % of our residents in the european union .
our directive would be binding for all eu member states , so that disabled people would not face discrimination .
there are lots of working groups meeting and working all the time and they still are meeting .
we need to have the overall directive first and then work from there .
i think we need to work on the overall directive first .
the reports on this have been extremely contradictory .
this is a very important statement .
subject iceland's application to join the european union
as the author is not present , question 16 lapses .
every day , large quantities of waste are produced in the eu's member states .
how we deal with this waste naturally has a major impact on the environment .
the directive on landfill is particularly difficult to implement .
the council has stated previously in its conclusions of june 2009 that it agrees with the commission .
we know we need to do this I agree we need to do biogas .
furthermore , one public deliberation was held on the initiative of the presidency .
it is also how we implement it and it is about attitudes .
lots of people in our european institutions have realised that transparency and openness is not dangerous .
we still have work to do .
there is still a lot to do , but we have come quite a long way .
that concludes question time .
questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing see annex .
agenda for next sitting see minutes
closure of the sitting
it is nevertheless very good that he is here .
that is the context of the question .
problems also occur in professions with higher levels of cross border mobility of workers such as teachers or tourist guides .
however , the solvit network has proven to be effective in solving many of these problems .
this has brought about enhancements in day to day administrative cooperation between member states .
this will be done during an ex post evaluation exercise foreseen by the directive .
i can only encourage the commission to exert more pressure on the member states .
this is a genuine problem for the citizens of europe .
it is important for us to acknowledge that there will inevitably be problems .
i would like to point out that it will never be possible to bring this subject to a close .
this shows contempt for parliament .
yes ?
well , I am sorry .
there are organisations which are attempting to do this .
the free movement of persons is one of the fundamental rights of the european union's citizens .
protectionism is doubtless another of the reasons .
that is another issue that we will have to address .
i believe it is very important that we look at this issue again .
however , I also have questions for the commission .
i am surprised that these guidelines are only appearing after more than four years .
why is that ?
i would like to ask you to arrange this with the directorate general responsible for this area .
the most obvious example is that of the medical professions .
i understand the scale of the problem perfectly .
ladies and gentlemen , in just under ten days , the deadline for transposition of the services directive expires .
we cannot allow that to go on , because solvit provides us with an excellent service .
mr president , let us get straight to the point here .
nl mr president , I should like to pick out one aspect in this debate .
this is an absolutely ridiculous , undesirable phenomenon that I believe must be eliminated .
however , one problem with this qualification framework is that it has not been implemented by the member states .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 149 
many people in the region I come from work in luxembourg , belgium or france .
i receive numerous enquiries from citizens who cross into one of the neighbouring countries to work .
we need a transparent , simple and clear recognition procedure .
the cohesion policy after 2013 debate 
they are our common european public good .
the challenges are well known the eu 2020 strategy has been opened to public consultations .
development policy with clear targets and tools is needed .
it is legitimate to ask where this energy could and should come from .
this effort involves close cooperation between relevant commission services and between the commission and relevant regional and local authorities .
the focus for my group is on the fact that solidarity between the regions is not negotiable .
we need a european approach which allows citizens to identify with the european union .
in future , we will not be able to subsidise everyone with european money .
we also need to concentrate on urban development .
our approach is to create stronger networks .
we need reform , but it must result in genuine change .
will we have the opportunity to construct transport and technical infrastructure in the coming period ?
will we manage to improve quality of life and make savings ?
unfortunately , forecasts for 2013 are even worse for the workers , especially in less developed areas .
even fewer will have to carry even more , with a possible loss of the rebate for the uk .
the border regions with their problems of cross border workers and cross border infrastructure would simply be neglected .
medium sized companies would be prevented from taking part successfully in international networks .
for this reason , we must retain this integrated approach for the entire european union .
europe becomes stronger whenever european solidarity is shown .
the european commission must , in our view , integrate the following principles .
renationalising this policy would be unacceptable for us .
de mr president , this is a central debate about the character of the european union .
the choice is between the market and social policy .
the structural funds must be strengthened and not weakened .
europe must do more and not less to overcome economic and social differences in development .
i would like to say one last word about the border regions .
in the light of the financial crisis , this is said to be a way of stimulating the economy .
indeed , we believe that , to be effective , this policy must be reformed and enhanced .
we look forward to obtaining clear responses in support of a genuine economic and social cohesion policy .
these are crucial values for regions like madeira , which face permanent difficulties and therefore require permanent support .
i should like to make three brief remarks in this respect .
investments related to environment protection are also extremely important .
it is important that realisation of the cohesion policy be based on regions and macroregions .
i firmly believe that rural development must continue to be a crucial aspect of the cohesion policy .
i sincerely hope that the commission will abandon that path once and for all .
i think it is very important to realise that there are huge poverty gaps within regions .
it is an important means of managing structural change in the regions and in local authority areas .
therefore , I would like to ask the commission to meet these requirements in the funding criteria for 20it would also , of course , have huge economic , financial and social consequences for those regions .
i am going to give you the floor , but you have just one minute .
we will only be able to consider it actually over when employment has returned to pre crisis levels .
we must not put at risk what has already been achieved .
local regions in europe need to continue with the cohesion policy in order to achieve the proposed objectives .
the disparities between the different regions must be reduced at a faster pace , without delay .
the present international economic crisis has bared its teeth .
in my opinion , we go to two extremes here .
cohesion policy must be the same for both urban and rural areas .
i also think that we need to invest more in public transport to develop urban mobility .
i am referring here , above all , to young people .
therefore , concerns that cohesion policy will be detached from the implementation of eu overall strategy are unfounded .
ladies and gentlemen , the debate on the future of the cohesion policy is of paramount importance .
in this context , interregional cooperation plays an important role .
however , there is still work to be done in the future .
this is the route which europe needs .
a new version of the document is currently being written .
it concerns a lady who has supported us in the european parliament for many years mrs birgitte stensballe .
i would ask my fellow members to put their trust in me with regard to the following process .
prominent government representatives from the eu are working to achieve a positive solution .
i do so for two reasons .
now I will ask for someone to speak against the motion .
we were also able to overcome differences of opinion in the same meeting .
loud applause 
i have one final request .
the president cut off the speaker 
i think this is immoral .
this house is irrevocably committed to the cause of human rights and duty bound to honour that obligation .
mr schulz made a proposal to the house this morning .
a decision should then be taken in plenary this afternoon at the start of the debate .
ladies and gentlemen , I would like to ask you for a moment's attention .
we cannot continue discussion on this matter indefinitely .
i repeat , the information should have been passed to us yesterday , before the joint resolution was debated .
mr president , clearly the house is divided .
you have heard everything and you have a full picture .
in accordance with rule 140 of the rules of procedure , I am putting this motion to a vote .
mobilisation of the flexibility instrument 
amendment to the multiannual financial framework 2007 2013 financing energy projects under the european economic recovery plan 
how is it possible that the voting list is so short ?
it is due to the excellent cooperation of the groups .
nonetheless , we hope that next year's budgetary procedure will allow sufficient time to deal with these matters .
being president in office of the council is probably the most distinguished office that I will ever hold .
applause 
congratulations to all !
applause 
the budgetary procedure can thus be deemed to be completed and the budget is declared definitively adopted . 
now I will officially sign the document .
voting time
the next item is voting time .
welcome
that is the oral amendment , and my proposal is to vote in favour of all three parts .
we have some very important work before us next year .
madam president , there is a mistake in the epp voting list .
defence of the principle of subsidiarity vote 
i am pleased that I am always able to wake my fellow members up .
this is good for the circulation .
i would like to remind everyone that we have just voted on the cashman report .
this is a report created by parliament in the course of an ongoing legislative procedure .
for this reason , we should not give in to them .
are we responsible for the convention on human rights ?
violence in the democratic republic of congo vote 
voting time continuation 
his accountants say that the accounts do not give a true and fair view of his party's affairs .
i voted against the budget resolution because it breaches the 1 % limit on gross domestic product .
we need to be aware that every euro we spend comes from the taxpayer .
it is interesting how we often talk about european common values and solidarity with the citizens .
that is why I voted against this budget .
i would be grateful if mr brok and mr saryusz wolski would go and have their discussions somewhere else .
there are reported rapes by almost all fighting parties , including the congolese army .
european military engagement contributed to the prevention of a situation similar to the one in rwanda .
we need seriously to end this now .
further financing of kozloduy in 2011 2013 should be without prejudice to the financing of existing multiannual programmes and actions .
i also endorse the need to extend the 2007 2013 mff to the years 2015 20i therefore voted in favour .
that is why we abstained .
i supported the european union budget for the financial year 20the 2010 eu budget has just been adopted .
this is a budget that will help to fight unemployment and kick start the economy .
i therefore voted in favour .
the creation of another heading to promote the transformation of jobs with no stability into jobs with rights .
this budget will enable romania to continue to enjoy financial support provided from the structural and cohesion funds .
only yesterday , parliament was voting for aid to be granted under the european globalisation adjustment fund .
it also fails to take account of increased social and regional inequalities , unemployment and poverty .
in the past , much vaunted eu programmes have turned out to be paper tigers .
in addition , various eu subsidies have proved to be an invitation to commit abuses of many different kinds .
i am particularly pleased by the inclusion in the budget of three projects which are important to my country .
i would like to emphasise that I am very much in favour of transparency and public access to documents .
negotiations , by definition , demand a discrete environment .
such improvements must safeguard the rights of all citizens of the union .
it is therefore essential to find a balance on this subject .
transparency is important and its importance is growing in the age of globalisation .
there can be no consent , on our part , to other measures .
i welcome the vote on this resolution .
the congolese authorities have recently shown their determination to put a stop to impunity .
the united nations security council should review the mandate of monuc .
united nations resolutions concerning an embargo on the supply of arms to the drc must be implemented .
the international community cannot look on helplessly .
monuc's presence remains necessary .
this morning we held a vote here to justify negotiations that existed between the european union and morocco .
the president must then inform parliament immediately .
applause 
this is in accordance with the rules of procedure .
i object to the fact that was not actually put to the house .
your point of order is therefore superfluous .
i shall be brief .
i have explained my understanding of the rules of procedure to you .
therefore , the procedure is in accordance with the rules of procedure .
however , I must tell you that I will cut you off , if this is not the case .
why should uganda's parliamentarians choose to throw all that goodwill away ?
i was rather worried that evening , as were the ugandan lesbians and gay men .
luckily nothing happened , but it marked the beginning of increasing homophobia in uganda .
we must not allow them to be subjected to hate laws and stand by and say nothing .
the ugandan legislation in force already criminalises homosexuality .
a ban on discrimination because of sexual orientation is nothing new .
the problem is that not everyone wants to recognise this kind of discrimination as a violation of human rights .
i therefore call on the commission to rethink our involvement with uganda if this bill is adopted .
this principle is not open to debate .
today , we need to add the new text to those already adopted .
the only attempt by a ugandan mp to table the anti homosexuality bill deserves a political response .
we must persevere until we succeed in bringing about the withdrawal of this iniquitous bill .
the bill , if adopted , raises serious human rights issues which are of great importance to the commission .
thereby it has the legal obligation to respect them , without distinction or discrimination .
the debate is closed .
azerbaijan freedom of expression
the next item is the debate on seven motions for a resolution on freedom of expression in azerbaijan .
author . mr president , azerbaijan is signatory to a number of partnerships with the eu .
i am pleased that we have succeeded in introducing a resolution which is supported by almost all the groups .
but we must ask why the regime of mr aliyev is implementing such horrific repression .
every concession is punished .
what can we do in this situation ?
such interventions have quite often been successful .
it is significantly more difficult to force institutional change .
however , no matter how important oil and gas are , they are not everything .
we should appreciate this .
in my opinion , we should address all issues that shake the democratic world .
the human rights prize has already been mentioned today .
we will make use of the diplomatic channels and you are causing more harm than good .
i would like to ask the group chairs to give us some freedom to act .
this has nothing to do with party politics .
today it was a different subject , the western sahara .
ladies and gentlemen , the case of azerbaijan demonstrates how important it is to be discerning here .
the country was a soviet satellite state .
now it is slowly beginning to become more democratic .
for over five years , I have been a member of the eu southern caucasus parliamentary cooperation committees .
i had the opportunity to visit azeri prisons .
azerbaijan will also benefit from assistance under the european initiative for democracy and human rights .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
debates on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law

i am pleased that the new members have settled in so well over the last few months .
resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday , 17 december 200statements by the president
teams sent by individual eu countries are also working there .
please stand .
representatives of the european parliament are observing the elections and were present yesterday .
we have not yet received official information on the progress of the elections .
on 1 january , spain assumed the presidency of the council of the european union .
order of business
mr president , it is not the intention that we should now arrive at a resolution .
it is good that we have had a discussion , but one without a resolution .
one minute speeches on matters of political importance
this decision has provoked reactions of disapproval from the british and dutch governments .
i think that this is a strictly bilateral dispute which should not influence iceland's eu accession process .
let us be realistic , there is no such thing as 100 % security .
i hope we will be able to do better than we did in copenhagen .
last week , the mayor of diyarbakir , osman baydemir , was banned from leaving the country .
the leader of our party , geert wilders , has to appear before a dutch court next week .
islam is no religion , it is an ideology that wants to take us over .
islam has no love for western freedom and democracy .
end islamification and end the prosecution of politicians on the basis of their political views !
this area is one of the poorest in the european union .
moreover , is it acceptable that the victims were not even informed of their rights ?
the president cut off the speaker 
romania is also waging a political campaign for the oppression of hungarian minorities .
in order to achieve this , we need a budget .
this is very important .
they were going to launch terrorist attacks in spain using explosives .
it says that the act also complies with international standards and pursues a legitimate goal .
the osce high commissioner for national minorities , knut vollebæk , praised the slovak republic .
i refer to the continuing upheaval of the financial markets .
i hereby demand that olaf mount the appropriate investigation .
individual member states have responded very well .
mr president , two months ago , my constituency was hit by disastrous floods .
so much for solidarity .
thank you for your speech .
we shall not accept that under any circumstances .
please check the list .
you can come to my office and we will check it together .
i am not afraid of such an inspection .

opening of the sitting
recent earthquake in haiti debate 
the losses are devastating and the damage is enormous .
our commitment to rebuilding haiti is long term .
that would only have diverted attention and scarce resources away from the relief effort .
in the meantime , we continue to work flat out on all tracks humanitarian , political and security .
this is ground breaking .
we must ensure that it is properly targeted towards sustainable political and physical reconstruction .
we convened a political and security committee meeting immediately after the council meeting to follow up .
the people of haiti and our own people expect a swift , effective and coordinated response .
this is what we believe we are delivering .
also , the international community has been hard hit .
we have , in fact , to save the country as a whole .
let me just very briefly focus on four main challenges .
that is always very difficult in these kinds of circumstances .
the second point is to build , or rebuild , the basic state capacity .
then we will have to see where we stand .
i will also go to the dominican republic .
there is no point impoverishing this country for another 100 years .
these are the problems that are swaying the balance between life and death for haitians .
it used to produce 90 % of its agricultural needs .
today , it imports more than half .
we must cancel haiti's debt and pay off our debt to that country .
i watched what happened in china .
how can this happen ?
for seven days now , they have been living , surviving in an absolute hell .
european food surpluses must be shipped out to the haitian people as a matter of urgency .
it must have only one objective , one sole concern the people , the children of haiti .
europe ought to demonstrate its own efficiency .
i will give my attendance allowance for today if every british mep will do the same .
globalism has destroyed our industries .
the banks have ruined our economies .
that is not compassion that is stinking hypocrisy .
recent events confirm the need to improve the european union's response to crises .
fr mr president , is haiti condemned to misfortune ?
the european union must participate in this twin emergency and reconstruction effort .
as for the european union , it has an extensive range of tools and solid experience in this area .
it is their development that we are talking about .
it distantly reminds me of a four headed dragon .
more importantly , what can be changed in future ?
it is easy , mrs ashton do this with those who want to do it !
as for the others , they will join us when they realise that this is the future .
parliament will follow you .
it is true that these problems exist and we need to solve them as soon as possible .
why ?
what we need is the rebirth , the resurgence , the re emergence and the redevelopment of haiti .
in my opinion , such talk is neither fair nor appropriate .
what are these people going to do then ?
they have nothing to do .
i am not a fire fighter .
did it work well ?
i hear the frustration . I understand it .
you are right . it should , and must , get better and better .
for the long term , honourable members are absolutely right .
when the cameras have gone , we need to be there .
let me finish on the reality of the situation .
many of the high government officials are missing .
it is a competence of the member states and not of the commission as such .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 149 
what will be the exact nature of this project and when will it see the light of day ?
ladies and gentlemen , the reports reaching us from haiti are shocking .
it can be clearly seen that the mechanisms which coordinate humanitarian aid are not the best .
i look forward to working with my colleagues to do what I can for the people of haiti .
iran is an important country with a deep history and rich culture , and a remarkably talented population .
in many ways , iranian society has the hallmarks and the capacity of a free society .
that , of course , is a matter for the iranians .
we work through the united nations the general assembly adopted a resolution condemning the situation only last month .
we need a serious engagement in meaningful talks from tehran's side .
our objective remains to build confidence that the nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes .
the widest possible unity is key if we are to achieve our objective .
in conclusion , the challenges posed by iran weigh very heavy in my portfolio .
i hope that it will be able to do this by approving the resolution on this topic .
yesterday was martin luther king day .
the disaster in haiti is a terrible tragedy , and I am glad you are taking action .
it is high time that europe takes one stance regarding iran , and the world is waiting .
i ask you the same .
the protests are many and they are still going on .
we must , however , keep the communication channels to the outside world open .
thus , for example , the council can blacklist individuals responsible for the repressive measures of recent months .
despite the rebuffs , we need to seek political dialogue .
isolating iran would help neither its people nor its neighbours in the region .
that brings me to a crucial question for the council , for you , high representative .
i await your answer .
an unprecedented wave of state repression is trying to silence those who are fighting for democratic reforms in iran .
it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the situation inside iran is continuing to deteriorate .
on the contrary , iran's long history shows us this .
why did we not seize this opportunity ?
we have legitimacy , europe has legitimacy .
the clamp down by the government has not subdued the voices of democratic dissent .
what funding does the commission provide to human rights ngos working in iran ?
however , this potential remains untapped .
i think that the iranian side needs to respond to the desire for dialogue expressed by the european union .
iran's current regime is the biggest threat to world peace .
today , however , if we take effective action , we can prevent the same thing from happening .
in clashes with security forces , eight people died , hundreds were injured and hundreds were detained .
the situation in iran is causing rising alarm , and this is also true at international level .
they wanted that .
so I really feel very sorry that this delegation visit could not take place .
people are dying in the streets almost every day in protests against this fascist regime .
no more talk no more appeasement .
that is the only way that we will show the ordinary people of iran that we back their protests .
i would urge you to continue with the dialogue .
the region will not be able to withstand another war .
hu three short questions .
what is the european union's view about this case ?
even today , there are dozens of political prisoners in jail in hungary .
we should seek talks .
we have the foreign affairs council .
mr president , before we break , I would just like to give a point of information .
baroness ashton , you were talking about the iran delegation .
the debate is closed .
the sitting was suspended at 17.30 and resumed at 17.35 
situation in yemen debate 
we traced the detroit bomber's trail from the united states to europe , to africa and yemen .
an inclusive internal political consensus on the way forward remains elusive .
the council adopted extensive conclusions on yemen in october .
a key focus of the meeting will be security .
this is why we need a comprehensive approach .
no amount of aid , however , can substitute for commitment and action by the government itself .
you have talked about coordination with the united states .
madam president , the media are already mobilising the populace for a third front in the war on terror .
we must not provide one sided support of the government against the rebels .
i repeat the local authorities , and not just the government .
indeed , citizens have the right to demand faultless monitoring of the terrorist threat .
conflict , lawlessness and corruption are deeply embedded .
at the moment , the uk is disproportionately providing assistance .
that is clear from the new breakout of hysteria following the attempted terrorist attack on the delta aircraft .
to make three or more is an indication of stupidity , insanity or deliberate mischief making .
what should the west in fact be doing to prevent the threat ?
high representative , might I ask you to please prevent yemen from becoming a second afghanistan .
that is our european path , and it may differ from other paths .
without political stability , yemen has no chance .
that alone will solve yemen's problems .
in late october , yemeni officials reported that they had intercepted a vessel laden with weapons from iran .
however , a catastrophe is not far away .
he would have done this yesterday .
this did not happen by accident .
once again , people are going to die , and we are going to say we are powerless .
i agree with the comment that this is not a christmas tree or wish list .
the debate is closed .
violence today is at its lowest since 200inter sectarian violence , a major problem in 2006 and 2007 , has been significantly reduced .
iraq has a new constitution and has conducted several elections with high participation at great risk .
thanks to the courage of the iraqi people , democratic institutions have taken root .
provincial elections last year went fairly smoothly all over iraq .
we are also developing our relations with iraq .
we want a broader and deeper political dialogue with iraq , which should also cover human rights .
i am confident it will use its new institutions to find the compromises necessary for national reconciliation .
i look forward to our debate .
a mature democracy also recognises the rights of minorities .
human rights watch continues to report that non muslim minorities are being persecuted .
you say that we act in accordance with iraq's priorities .
that is perhaps not iraq's top priority , but it is ours .
on behalf of the alde group . madam president , the fact is that iraq is not secure .
that is a fact .
regarding the energy memorandum of understanding , this is very important , but iraq is not a unitary state .
there needs to be an integrated approach concerning the states neighbouring iraq .
as proof of this , the commission has decided not to send observers because it cannot guarantee their safety .
i believe this decision speaks for itself .
moreover , that truth cannot reasonably continue with the presence of the occupying forces , which is distorting everything .
baroness ashton , european leaders should strive to convince the iraqi authorities to abolish it .
one and a half million iraqis still live in neighbouring countries .
many will never be able to return .
the objective of the terrorists and the sponsors of international terrorism is the destabilisation of iraq .
that must be seen as a positive thing , particularly in an arab country .
are the iraqi authorities not doing just this ?
do you think it is possible to achieve further development together with either mr oettinger or mr de gucht ?
the review of candidates was always part of the pre electoral process .
there is an appeals procedure , which I trust will be allowed to run its proper course .
i will feed that back to the commissioners designate .
there are significant challenges , and honourable members are right to remind us of those significant challenges .
this aid needs to be supplied for a sufficiently long period of time .
how long ?
the sitting was suspended at 19.25 and resumed at 21.00 
we must therefore carry out a radical overhaul of all our policies .
i am sorry to tell you that this is not the case today .
therefore , our intention is not to weaken the jpa .
the commission believes that regional differentiation within the framework of cotonou is more an opportunity than a threat .
this by no means signifies disrupting the acp group , and our acp partners largely share this approach .
let me now briefly comment on sectoral policies which you are stressing in your report .
we see our contribution in all of that .
certain governments , as you know , are reluctant to encourage parliamentary debate in their countries .
reducing these to one session would send out an extremely negative message to our partners .
we keep talking about alleviating poverty .
she says that eight times what we put into those countries goes out .
we would do better to realise that what africa needs is not aid but food self determination .
mr michel spoke about this .
fr mr president , article 13 of the cotonou agreement has not been revised since 2000 .
we should therefore concentrate on legal immigration and mobility .
in this regard , the clear identification of priorities is extremely important .
regular dialogue with local populations will enable a realistic adjustment to be made .
to ensure better cohesion between the different pillars of the agreement is absolutely essential .
we should look to people instead of to money , to substance instead of to advertisements .
this will allow us to utilise our strategies to the best effect .
this is important for both contracting parties .
i urge the commission and the spanish presidency to rectify this .
there are myriad mechanisms that currently ensure that many of these countries remain subject to domination and subjugation .
let us promote self sufficiency .
that would certainly put a stop to social emigration and the flight from social poverty .
we are talking about countries at the mercy of poverty , indigence and disease .
i think that this would be liable to make the debate a little more open .
migration .
so let us use the opportunities that we have within this agreement to establish this rule in europe .
we can change the mandate of our bank .
let us take action in this regard .
yet what is behind this phrase ?
does it , secondly , mean access to information about what has come to be called family planning ?
we have supported the latter because , then , more criminals get caught .
one of those cases is my own constituent andrew symeou .
that was with regard to the council during the swedish presidency .
thank you for this question .
you know how much I value these procedural guarantees .
the commission has worked tirelessly to ensure that european legislation is adopted in this area .
it is true that the roadmap's step by step approach ultimately seemed to us to be a good solution .
this is essential if we want to create a truly european judicial area .
we were concerned about the timetable and scope of application of the future initiatives on procedural rights .
this draft initiative is already with parliament and the first debate has already taken place .
we would like these procedural rights to be considered as a package .
so why is it that until recently , this has been stuck in the council's in tray ?
it has substantially cut the time needed for surrender .
it was never intended solely to cover terrorist crimes it was intended to cover all serious crimes .
they share a small cell with three other prisoners .
they are confined to their cells 23 hours a day .
they are allowed one family visit per month .
they are accused of a white collar crime .
and they are imprisoned only because of the european arrest warrant .
hungary must institute such guarantees .
we must be more efficient and more rapid .
the committee calls for the council to continue work in introducing common european procedural rights in criminal matters .
the eaw is destroying innocent people's lives .
let me make a suggestion .
the key concept is the concept of trust .
i would like to make one final point about the european arrest warrant .
the debate is closed .
preventing trafficking in human beings debate 
this is probably so unbelievable that the interpreters said several hundred instead of several hundred thousand .
i think that europe has an obligation to increase the struggle against human trafficking .
i would like to address two matters .
the first is the protection of victims , and the second the elimination of demand .
we absolutely agree that this is the right approach .
i believe that your idea on the subject of demand is also important .
we therefore agree with the proposal in this question , which seems to us highly appropriate .
you also asked us about preventive measures .
i can say , on this subject , that the european union is working on such preventive measures .
sentences must be severe and the harmonisation of maximum penalties must continue .
i now come to the help and protection provided to victims .
the system for legal aid and representation should be free , especially for children .
following this report , we will see whether it is appropriate to amend the directive .
next I come to data collection .
the commission has invested heavily in the development of common indicators for data collection .
as we have said already , human trafficking is perhaps the very worst form of crime .
my second point concerns the protection of victims .
their rights and their future must be top priority .
that is what I would like to see .
its worst form is the trafficking of children , which is often linked to sexual abuse .
i have been pleased to hear a unanimous opinion expressed here .
unfortunately , however , the numbers refute this .
according to un figures , we have 270 000 victims in the european union .
thank you very much for your attention .
in fact , it is a definition of slavery .
extreme poverty , family breakdown and domestic violence contribute to some of the root causes of human trafficking .
in the uk , we estimate approximately 5 000 victims , of which 330 are children .
demand is a key word as regards the combating of trafficking in human beings .
we really owe it to all the victims .
ordinary people usually have no idea of the enormous scale of trafficking in human beings .
the fact that it mostly concerns women and children makes this immense business all the more inhumane .
sv slavery has not yet been abolished , as many in this house have already emphasised .
it is also an internal problem .
this , too , is human trafficking , and we must not be silent about it .
we must not send them back into the arms of the human traffickers .
sk I would like to congratulate the authors of this question , mrs hedh and mrs bauer .
however , it fails to mention that parents should play a primary role in protecting children from trafficking .
this campaign should alert parents to the risks that their children face .
unfortunately , parents are not mentioned anywhere in the draft resolution .
too few criminals are brought to justice .
the victims do not receive appropriate assistance , shelter or compensation .
it is obvious that this problem does not affect only the european union .
we therefore need great political will to tackle the problem .
it is happening in europe and we must tackle it from europe .
incidentally , minister , this was a strong demand made by the spanish presidency .
as you said , minister , political will does exist in the european parliament .
i believe the commission has already done some good preparation work on this draft directive .
written statements rule 149 
the eu must urgently tackle trafficking in the labour market .
those affected by human trafficking have not taken a free , informed decision about all this .
they are to be treated entirely as victims .
apart from the political will not being there , the police will is not there either .
announcement by the president
at all events , the european parliament is in full control of the situation .
the next item is the statement by the council on presentation of the programme of the spanish presidency .
europe was the dream of generations , of many generations of spaniards .
we need to commit ourselves to maintaining the stability pact and fulfil the commission's indications for 20we know what the european union's strengths and weaknesses are .
we represent almost 60 % of global development aid , which is a great strength for the european union .
what do we need to do ?
we want to take steps to establish a digital market .
what does this involve ?
we want to launch and promote , along with the commission , a plan to develop electric vehicles .
we need to conclude the bologna process .
economic change and political change , and change in the government of the union .
it strengthens parliament , the heart of european democracy , and also strengthens the commission .
i hope that the vote will take place very soon .
everything points in the direction of determined and united european action .
however , I am confident in the capacities of europe .
i believe that an economy rebuilding its strengths has a real chance to redirect its energies .
europe's huge industrial assets need to be re directed to seizing the first mover advantage in tomorrow's markets .
but europe must be able to retain a solid , modern and competitive industrial base .
this also includes our sme friendly approach .
let me just mention one of many examples the follow up to the copenhagen conference on climate change .
today , we are forecasting our role for many years to come .
i would like to thank mr barroso for presenting the point of view of the european commission .
thank you very much .
now I would like to ask the leaders of the political groups for their comments and remarks .
we have held many summits in the past .
applause 
for this , we need new approaches and , therefore , you are on the right path .
i would therefore like to add that we also need more economic control in europe .
so , I wish you good luck , mr zapatero .
applause 
i believe you also have , in fact , two priorities .
first of all , there is the post lisbon eu 2020 strategy .
it is as if the union has become the oecd .
that is the reality publishing one document after another , after another .
applause 
therefore , the strategy has to change .
that meant that there were at least eight european political leaders who wanted to negotiate .
there was scarcely room for mr obama even .
moreover , we must , I believe , be realistic .
tomorrow's world is one of empires , and we must be an empire .
applause 
this was during mr barroso's commission .
you see , I am no sectarian .
that is already one issue for consideration .
however , there is another consideration .
there is a major project that could be developed in europe .
why not develop a major european tramways project ?
in this way , you will be able to give it another mobility related function .
if you go down that path , we will be in agreement , and europe is the solution .
it stumbled in its first few days in office .
socialism does not do that .
that issue is iran .
our group will judge its proposals and initiatives on their merits .
this is the actual reality .
on this specific point , there is no innovation .
we need doctors , architects and people to relieve the pain of the tragedy .
on behalf of the efd group . mr president , thank you .
is this situation I describe going to bring peace to europe ?
deficit and surplus are tools , depending on the economic cycle .
spain has been a victim of this , as have some citizens , not only british citizens .
that is my opinion .
mr schulz , thank you for your words .
mr verhofstadt , I am extremely grateful for your words .
with regard to coordination and the failure of lisbon , open coordination failed .
we are aware of this .
government requires a community method .
also , it works .
a progressive programme is one which sees changes , one which anticipates them and is capable of innovating .
i hope and trust that the european union will keep in step with this .
in the whole of my speech , I talked about sustainable growth , environmentally sustainable growth .
it is for us to join forces .
of course I completely agree I believe that the european union has a clear position regarding iran .
i share your concern and your feelings on this subject .
we will , at all times , promote the defence of human rights .
we do not have to go very far .
that is all on the first question .
without doubt , there will be heads of state or government who will represent their own countries .
the third question concerns economic policy .
that is not the case .
there is , therefore , joint monitoring .
comment made off microphone 
both the letter and the spirit of the treaty of lisbon are very clear .
a stronger europe !
thank you , mr barroso .
what we need to do now is to apply them in the right way .
the measure of a good presidency is not conventional speeches or great words , or common places .
it is a crucial time owing to the entry into force , finally , of the treaty of lisbon .
i therefore believe that the spanish presidency is right to start by reaffirming values the importance of equality .
the crisis necessitates global thinking and local action , but you need to join forces with everyone .
include the regions , build decision making processes with them .
this also means applying the treaty of lisbon , which gives them a role for the first time .
that is illustrative of the importance which it ascribes to consumer protection .
the further large scale immigration you are advocating can only lead to large scale problems .
however , what do you really have to say ?
i would like to make one thing clear europe cannot afford a 20 % unemployment rate .
how have you responded to the crisis ?
he is the example you should follow .
those in your ranks who played their part in causing this bear the responsibility .
mr zapatero , with regard to the social pact in particular , you have our full support .
mr zapatero , you have broken the fine tradition of the psoe in europe .
reforms help nations to progress more than revolutions and europe is a model of good practice in this regard .
come here with humility and learn , do not seek to lecture .
what has happened , mr zapatero ?
pt mr president , this period should herald a sea change in european union policies and priorities .
the spanish presidency says it wishes to increase immigration .
at present , all this appears to me to be clearly contradictory .
do we want new immigrants who have no homes or jobs ?
the president cut off the speaker 
it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , welcome , mr rodríguez zapatero .
these really are challenges which again require more common resources and better political coherence .
other presidencies will use you as an example .
you are therefore creating the blueprint , so to speak .
i would like subsequent presidencies to have to measure themselves against you where cooperation structures are concerned .
that is the only way of building the confidence required for accession .
for now , we cannot see the factors that will make it different and more credible than its predecessor .
so far , we have heard only about slogan like targets , and an extremely tight schedule for adopting it .
when working under pressure there will be no time to answer all these questions .
haste comes at the expense of quality .
i have two questions .
there is too much wage dumping and too much crude exploitation .
it is a european problem .
it is a problem of european citizenship .
i am sorry , prime minister .
mr president , one of the changes the prime minister spoke of this morning is the citizensinitiative .
secondly , this morning , you mentioned food security , prime minister .
the programme also includes the review of the ten t action guidelines .
the european economic recovery plan has included the european union's involvement in funding the nabucco gas pipeline .
thank you , above all , for that reference to the european social charter .
presentation of the programme of the spanish presidency continuation of debate 
i must therefore voice some concern about the direction in which this debate on values is heading .
at this time in europe , we must not fail to live up to these expectations
mr president , I welcome the prime minister's very positive and ambitious programme for the spanish presidency .
you have committed yourself to this .
prime minister , on behalf of the portuguese socialists , I wish you luck .
the president cut off the speaker 
i would like to ask the commission to do so in time .
to what interests do you refer ?
the president cut off the speaker 
initially you mentioned further integration .
after drawing a lesson from the crisis , we need real economic revolution .
your response would be most welcome .
allow me to say a few words about the interventions of my compatriots , the spanish meps .
applause 
applause 
i refer to the work carried out by mr durão barroso .
applause 
applause 
there was a question concerning the area of foreign policy .
the middle east , latin america in particular , and an allusion to israel .
we know what the aims and the conditions are .
we know that that dialogue must include the recognition of the palestinian state as one of its fundamental conditions .
those are european interests .
currently , after making such significant progress , we are experiencing the economic crisis , which is affecting employment .
it would be a response of support and solidarity .
written statements rule 149 
based on my knowledge of these objectives , I have noted points in common with those of romania .
moldova is in need of financial and political support at the moment .
everyone is aware of the interdependence and interconnectivity between our respective economies .
the eu must remain a union of diversity and of nation states it owes that to its citizens .
it also owes it to its citizens to finally do some plain talking in the negotiations with turkey .
a mass influx of turks and exploding parallel societies would finally finish the eu off .
all these are ambitious objectives and , at the same time , of fundamental importance to europe's citizens .
thank you , mr zapatero , for your inaugural speech .
however , it lacked a clear reference to the problem of huge deficits .
once again , the spanish presidency of the eu has come at a crucial time .
however , will the newly appointed high representative for foreign affairs and security policy do this ?
such action is especially in the interest of spain , which has been hit by the recession exceptionally hard .
how should the fight against the crisis in europe and the world be coordinated ?
it is especially important to ensure a smooth transition between individual presidencies so that continuity of work is maintained .
mr president , I would like to welcome the spanish presidency very warmly .
i must admit that I have specific expectations of this presidency .
firstly , because one of the priorities of the spanish presidency is energy security .
i am very pleased to note this fact .
it will receive my full commitment .
the eu 2020 strategy must find solutions to meet these expectations .
ladies and gentlemen , spain is going to lead the union for the fourth time .
thank you .
election of the european ombudsman vote 
the tools are transparency and service minded institutions .
we all have a responsibility to support him in that work .
temporary suspension of autonomous common customs tariff duties on imports of certain industrial products into madeira and the azores 
for details of the outcome of the vote see minutes 
explanations of vote
oral explanations of vote
i must point out that this is a positive vote for all of us , for all european citizens .
after all , this actually promotes the brain drain of the most skilled , dynamic and enterprising africans .
the week has been given over to backroom manoeuvring .
this is the reality of so called circular migration .
i welcome the re election of nikiforos diamandouros to the office of european ombudsman for another term until 20in writing . I fully support the re election mr nikiforos diamandouros to the office of european ombudsman .
in the vote to elect the ombudsman , I voted for pierre yves monette .
i therefore voted in favour .
we agree with the content of the proposals contained in the document .
i recall that this matter was subject to a simplified legislative procedure so as to speed it up .
this is why we must monitor closely the impact this suspension has on competition .
the outermost regions can act as the prime intermediaries for the eu in economic partnership agreements .
issues that relate to child labour must be given top priority in eu trade agreements .
the situation has changed since the agreement was first signed and new challenges and problems have arisen .
global warming , which predominantly affects developing countries , may also present an opportunity for us .
natural resources should be used properly and the development of renewable energy should be encouraged .
i therefore voted in favour .
that agreement is a symbol of the european union's complete adherence to the ultra liberal logic of the wto .
the european union must constantly re evaluate its trade policies and the impact they have in this regard .
neither has happened , to the ultimate shame of the european commission .
it is time we admitted that fair access to natural resources really can help lift people out of poverty .
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
swift debate 
these are things that we regard as important .
we want to cooperate with our partners in the fight against terror .
careful consideration is also needed here .
as parliament , we are capable of working quickly and we will be able to deal with this quickly .
someone stuffs some explosives into their underwear and flies over the atlantic .
that is what the intensive security work carried out by the american secret services has so far achieved .
that cannot be what it is dependent on , though .
this therefore means that we now have one week to discuss it in parliament that is the reality .
i would like to ask you one more thing .
mr president , this house has been treated in an insulting and almost humiliating way throughout this whole process .
only one mep was present in brussels . that mep happened to be me .
however , the council did not sanction this procedure , it legalised it !
obviously , I do not have that information .
therefore , it is valid .
it is not a matter of gaining time , mr weber .
i understand that the european parliament would have liked to have this version earlier .
parliament will be able to , if it wishes , cut short the validity of this provisional agreement .
one exception soon becomes many , and I cannot deny mr schulz the floor .
please proceed , mr schulz .
this is a legislative chamber in which serious work is required !
that is something that I am now formally requesting to know on behalf of our group .
the facts will show this .
i will not give the floor to anyone else on this matter .
our policy on climate change is one of the key identifying characteristics of the european model .
i volunteered to substitute for stavros in this very important debate .
the contacts with your delegation throughout the conference proved most useful .
it contains no reference to mid term or long term mitigation targets .
one striking lesson certainly is that we must learn to speak with one voice .
the same goes for global economic governance and international security .
let us take copenhagen as an alarming warning of that scenario .
europe's political performance was simply poor .
as a fellow member said recently , europe was absent .
that only increases the risk of the mistakes being repeated .
however , we definitely need to change our strategy we need a new strategy .
we also need a new form of climate diplomacy .
it is not enough that our experts know their way through the technical jungle .
this is a crazy economic policy because it has no net benefit for the environment whatsoever .
what we need is a comprehensive worldwide agreement .
clarity is needed .
however , I cannot help asking whether we are going the right way about it .
the problem these islands face is that they are under threat from rising water levels .
this is not a victimless crime .
carbon credit trading makes billions for city sharks at the expense of families in poverty .
they must and will be called to account , as should their collaborators in places such as this .
i would like to add one thing to what has already been said .
it was the first council configuration under the spanish presidency .
that is not a good sign .
it is your job and your responsibility to find the common denominator among the 27 member states .
in terms of showing credibility , the eur 7.2 billion must actually be realised before mexico .
the countries in africa need to be able to see that the first measures are already in progress .
mr president , and fellow collaborators , we need to move on from copenhagen .
the truth is we do not know the way .
thirdly , the climate .
it is true that we agreed on two degrees , but this figure also means something .
the science says that two degrees means rich countries must reduce their co2 emissions by 40 % .
and what were the lessons ?
we need objective , impartial scientific research , and not an agenda driven political activism .
commissioner , minister , I hope you will look at these questions with an open mind .
there is no agreement on how we are to effectively limit the further warming of the planet .
it is the same in poland , korea and china .
when are you all going to wake up ?
climate , mr davies , is what we all have to put up with .
it ended in failure .
canada signed the kyoto treaty , and then increased its carbon dioxide emissions by 26 % without any consequences .
i still remember the debate we had here in this house before copenhagen .
the us and china together account for almost half .
obviously , we can criticise the us .
a transatlantic market for carbon emissions could be the start of a global market .
the eu must speak with one voice in these negotiations .
we need a climate jobs strategy .
under these circumstances , it is clearly easy to knock the un process .
reread parliament's resolution and immediately opt for an unconditional 30 % .
the measures needed for this , however , have remained a mystery .
so what should europe do now ?
unfortunately , the results from copenhagen were well below par in the circumstances .
that is the first main reason we are expressing our disappointment .
this is not the role we would wish for or the role which befits us .
so what needs to be done ?
the eu needs to commit itself now to a 30 % cut in emissions for three reasons .
we cannothalf committo investment in renewable energy sources and low carbon transport .
secondly , politics will get back to genuine topics that really concern people in today's economic recession .
thirdly , it will prevent the waste of taxpayersmoney on controversial green projects .
fi mr president , the copenhagen climate summit was a complete flop .
a few days before it began , emissions trading fraud worth eur 5 billion was exposed .
this was shameful , and is the eu now at all worried that these abuses will be investigated ?
that is to no avail workers and employees should not be made to suffer .
it all went wrong in copenhagen .
it could also be called a defeat .
a second set of questions also needs answers .
other states are taking different approaches , but it is not the case that they are doing nothing .
mr president , I do not want to depict a doom scenario , as has been done here .
we must be able to convince others to be as ambitious as we are .
well , we certainly know it there is nothing right now .
we have nothing . so we had better have a planbnext time .
europe really needs one voice .
copenhagen stood for much more than a climate summit .
we failed to understand the commitment of china and other developing countries .
the eu should reposition itself and set a new mandate by the time of the negotiating round in mexico .
they talk and talk until they have all melted .
to be frank , on a bad day , this debate does remind me a little of that .
finally , as many of my fellow members have already said , we must speak with one voice .
the eu and this parliament need to examine honestly how it approaches such matters in the future .
europe must win that race regardless of what our friends do or do not do .
what is more , we have to attach greater importance to science .
how is the european union going to organise itself in order to reach an agreement ?
over the next few months , we shall have to see if things can still be put right .
can you tell us that ?
hu mr president , we should not embellish things .
what do we need in order to achieve this ?
europe can no longer accept a situation in which certain imported products do not satisfy environmental requirements .
i would , however , ask all of you to keep your speech under one minute .
ro in line with expectations , the copenhagen summit did not end with any concrete results .
that is why the eu is cut out of the final negotiations .
why talk to a negotiator who cannot move at all and has no flexibility ?
the intergovernmental panel on climate change said in 2007 that they would disappear by the year 20it must not be manufactured and it must not be invented .
i do not believe that any of these issues should make us lower our guard .
now , more than ever , we must maintain our position , minister .
so , please , when are we going to acknowledge that agriculture .
the president cut off the speaker 
mr president , the next steps from copenhagen should improve the position and negotiation abilities of the united nations .
the european union needs to reclaim the role of leader and make itself heard with one voice .
allow me , however , to say a few more words following my opening speech .
no one knows better than the european union how hard it is to build this collective leadership .
we must stand shoulder to shoulder in our work , facing the future .
we need to make every effort to fulfil our kyoto commitments as we are approaching the finishing line .
this obliges chinese manufacturers , too , to change course .
in the meantime , copenhagen has undoubtedly made sure everyone is alert , greatly heightening our environmental awareness .
this is an important sign .
the current liberal trade regulations encourage higher carbon dioxide emissions .
these measures result in additional costs for businesses .
meanwhile , many developing countries do nothing to reduce their emission of greenhouse gases .
the copenhagen conference on climate change was disappointing .
there were no legally binding commitments determining the future framework of international climate protection .
accordingly , the european union should work on polishing up its internal regulations on climate protection .
the regulations of the union should be made more efficient without causing competitive disadvantage for european industries .
mr president , it was with some dismay that I heard these complaints of a poor outcome at copenhagen .
the problem of climate warming is one of the main issues troubling the modern world .
recently , in copenhagen , a climate summit devoted to this issue was held .
question time council 
the following questions are addressed to the council .
i would remind you that the whole financial system was in danger of meltdown at the end of 200the council appreciated that the measures adopted by the states had been significant in keeping credit channels open .
it is doing this is a systematic manner .
i am sorry , but I have to rule your question completely out of order .
we know perfectly well that the situation is very different in different member states .
i believe there is a later question which deals with exactly the same issue .
these conclusions were endorsed by the last european council on 10 and 11 december 200 de president in office , I have two further specific questions .
however , as I said , the primary point is the visa arrangements .
as you know , the commission is working on the details of this .
subject devastation of the tropical rainforests
this has even led to the modification of the european union's rural development policy .
i agree with the first speech .
we must tackle tropical deforestation in developing countries .
subject european level action on combating alzheimer's disease
can the council give further details on the recently announced joint programming initiative on combating these illnesses ?
it is therefore important that there is cooperation on a european level in this respect .
what the council and the european union have done is put forward these guidelines regarding this disease .
i do not know about the rest of europe .
the council spoke about guidelines .
that is what it is there for .
subject corporate social responsibility csr 
the spanish presidency will continue to promote it .
the problem is that these subsidiaries are separate legal entities .
why not use this method with regard to social matters , too ?
we intend to get this agreement completed during the spanish presidency .
de thank you for your statements , mr lópez garrido .
this is the place to achieve that agreement between the two spheres .
in the treaties of the european union , there is a clear division of competences .
it must be remembered that an excessive deficit procedure anticipates supervision of economic policies in justified cases .
at the same time , there has been the transfer of certain amounts towards the modernisation of a region .
minister , thank you very much for your participation in this first question time with your presidency .
questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers see annex .
composition of committees see minutes
the next item is the council and commission statements on democratisation in turkey .
member of the commission . madam president , I welcome this very important debate on turkish democratisation .
simultaneously , pkk terrorist attacks continue unabated in the south east and put the lives of turkish soldiers at risk .
i agree with commissioner rehn that it is terribly important that turkey move towards democracy .
i have called on them to follow the debate with very specific measures to flesh out this opening .
this also threatens to put an end to this opening and I have a nasty feeling about this .
these promises must be realised .
in modern europe , quite simply , they are not .
ladies and gentlemen , I , too , regret the ruling of the turkish constitutional court .
we must make an unambiguous commitment .
after all , turkey is more than just the politicians and negotiators it is also the people .
this leaves a question mark hanging over this decision .
therefore , turkey now needs our support , our unfailing support in this process of democratisation .
thirteen parties have been buried by supreme court judgments .
the democratisation process in turkey undoubtedly depends on the solution of the kurdish issue .
it has helped the democratisation and modernisation process in turkey .
here , in this parliament , we are used to saying what others should do .
let us play it by ear .
it needs and deserves democracy .
i look forward to welcoming him soon in his new portfolio .
i have to say that I completely disagree with that .
in contrast , we must speak out against any part of the journey that leads in the wrong direction .
madam president , turkey holds elections but is not a democracy in the accepted western sense .
this is hardly a positive vision for a proud nation .
the european perspective is a driving force for democratic reforms .
we europeans should support the reforms .
i think we should pledge to support them on this path .
the results several years later are , unfortunately , very poor .
reforms have ground to a halt and those implemented are basically dead letter .
the accession process is an open ended process , which was also stated when we opened accession negotiations .
madam president , I am not exactly sure why we are having this debate at this particular time .
of course , banning political parties is generally a bad idea , although there are exceptions to that rule .
of course , the pkk has its political fronts .
the status of children and women needs improving , especially in rural areas .
orthodox believers have suffered discrimination and there are probably now only around 3 000 of them in turkey .
eighteen months ago , the governing justice and development party akp narrowly escaped the same fate .
in addition , a party system that results in better representation of the turkish population must be introduced .
this can be done by drastically reducing the 10 % electoral threshold .
the use of party bans as a stake in a political game must be prevented .
it remains for me to thank commissioner rehn for his tremendous cooperation .
this development must continue .
that is dishonourable and creates uncertainty not just in turkey , but also in other candidate countries .
naturally , turkey cannot join the eu until all the criteria are met .
there are still major shortcomings .
i believe that my fellow member from denmark has already touched upon this .
every time turkey opens a door to democratisation , it slams another door shut .
the question is what measures will you take to protect the rights of kurdish citizens ?
another important matter is the ability of women to participate in public life .
i would also like to mention the kurds , and namely to recognise them as a national minority .
the progress reports on turkey presented to the european parliament are the result of the balances between these forces .
trade unionists are prosecuted and sentenced in sham trials .
turkey continues to deny fundamental rights to kurds and other minorities .
it is threatening greece with casus belli and putting forward territorial claims .
the ban on the activities of the party is a typical political ploy .
despite the reforms and the progress made in turkey , numerous laws are not applied .
therefore , stop the negotiations !
i regret that the eu fails to approach this issue thoroughly .
we need to draw a distinction here in order to be fair and honest .
therefore , that process will be of benefit to both interests .
negotiation is a strategic element and should be upheld as outlined by commissioner olli rehn in his speech .
we must be very clear with turkey .
that outlines the situation .
member of the commission . madam president , I am glad to say my last word on turkey .
today's debate has focused largely on the party closure and rightly so .
mr van baalen and mr schmidt raised the issue of the court of auditorsrecent report on turkey .
i think it is important , apart from party closures , to discuss the democratic transformation more broadly .
many authors and journalists are still facing prosecution and conviction for their work .
that is essential for this project to succeed in the end .
we must be very cautious in merely taking a didactic approach in guiding turkey's democratisation process .
pre accession negotiations with a candidate country should be aimed at the given country's accession to the european union .
pre accession talks have been open since 3 october 200turkey's historic affiliation with europe is undeniable .
however , where has thissoft powergot us ?
now there is yet another party ban .
however , this applies to turkey , too !
financial resources are also needed .
romania has the largest section of the river danube among all the riparian states .
it is therefore almost possible to see the reunification of europe along the danube .
we have already seen evidence of this in connection with the gabčíkovo power station project .
that is something that we should give particular consideration to in this connection .
this is exactly how we need to approach the danube .
sustainability and mindfulness of the natural environment are of the utmost importance here .
let us not repeat the mistakes of the past !
the danube region is a very specific and indisputably vast territory .
hence , it is certainly positive that this region has been receiving specific attention .
the european commission will provide technical and coordination support .
the creation of opportunities for cooperation with non member states of the european union is envisaged in the project .
such a new impetus for economic growth will also create many jobs .
how many of the countries have launched the process of public consultations ?
i am thinking of local government agencies , non government organisations , businesses and ordinary citizens .
we can say that this facilitated cultural and economic cooperation long before the idea of european integration was born .
so real ownership of the process is needed here .
what we already agree upon rather are principles and things that go without saying .
however , as we all know , the devil is in the detail .
however , these countries vary in terms of their economic development .
the individual projects should not be mutually competitive .
however , I also expect the efficient use of resources , both financial and human .
i expect a rise in the quality of life and numerous good and inspiring ideas .
i believe that this project will help the region develop more actively .
i hope that this project will help improve cooperation between the union and these countries in the region .
talking about the development of the danube , we should also look at education , social integration and acceptance .
this is why regional authorities respond in different ways to the problems they are facing .
sk slovakia welcomes this initiative .
the baltic strategy has been instrumental in opening up the prospect of macro regions .
thank you .
we have many initiatives and forms of cooperation of this kind .
today , we see it as a symbol of cooperation .
in 1823 , andrews and prichard were granted exclusive rights for arterial navigation within the austrian territories .
maybe it was because the hungarian , romanian , german and austrian interests could not be reconciled .
some aspects have already been mentioned .
i would like to raise a slightly different point that has occasionally been mentioned in today's discussion .
we sincerely hope that we will move in this direction .
i want to congratulate you on your level of interest and dedication to the subject .
so , in conclusion , I would like to thank you for your support for the danube strategy .
the debate is closed .
throughout history , the danube has played a central role in europe .
closure of the sitting
eu tunisia relations debate 
furthermore , it has always played a constructive role towards regional integration in the maghreb .
we also expect that tunisia will show a real drive towards more democratic reforms and freedom of expression .
the next item is the speeches of the political groups .
the indicators speak for themselves 59 % of students in higher education are female .
obviously , I am not insensitive to specific cases that some people have raised .
you have all rightly pointed out that tunisia was our first partner to sign an association agreement .
no .
there is a huge , ongoing decline in human rights and democracy in tunisia .
can you name one single newspaper , party or union that has been authorised in the last 20 years ?
no .
there has been no further progress since that time .
we should respect tunisia as our euro mediterranean advanced partner .
i would like to welcome you to the gallery .
all along , I have defended human rights , but human rights are the same all over the world .
i regret that this debate should not have been accompanied by a vote on a resolution .
students are being arrested and arbitrarily convicted , as are others .
why did it refuse to host eu observers if the elections are as democratic as it says they are ?
yes , I am in favour of equal partnerships !
they have the most stable society in north africa .
its official policy is the pursuit of cultural unity the creation of one nation .
so maybe we should learn something from the tunisians .
but look at what tunisia did .
law no 108 bans the hijab , which goes much further than anybody else has proposed .
de mr president , trade relations between the eu and tunisia are close and multifaceted .
de mr president , we have a good foundation for our cooperation with tunisia .
mrs kroes said that we are talking about integrating the tunisian economy into the single market .
however , in this connection , we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater .
we had a frank exchange and debated our respective views .
the debate on this issue , as it appears in tunisia , is crucial and relevant .
aside from trade relations , we must also take account of social issues .
real progress in the field of human rights is now crucial .
there are problems .
there is indeed a difference in approach .
having said that , I would like to touch upon a couple of the issues that were raised .
the project has many components .
i certainly agree that working in that area exposes us to certain political risks .
written statements rule 149 
people have a universal right to freedom of religion as well as freedom from religion .
yet state emergency laws have been in place in egypt for the past 28 years .
a free debate is perhaps the most powerful medicine against extremism and violence .
precisely because of its history , europe must commit itself on this front .
the egyptian authorities react quickly .
we must act resolutely , or else those who persecute christians will think they have our tacit blessing .
mr president , freedom of religion is an essential element of human rights .
that is the case , amongst other places , in egypt .
over the last 10 to 20 years , specifically , violence against copts has grown enormously .
more than 100 attacks , with thousands of victims , have already been reported .
the egyptian government's attitude , in my view , is spineless .
three men have been taken into custody , but , generally speaking , the violence against christians is tolerated .
this is an outrageous disgrace !
the place of anti christian communism has today been taken principally by militant islam .
unfortunately , the bureau did not adopt the proposal , but perhaps such a report would be worth writing .
the resolution we are adopting today should give a clear message .
in the letter , he gives his assurance that the events of which I have spoken were isolated incidents .
we must not confuse the acts of one criminal with the policy of an entire country !
we keep hearing the same complaints and proposing the same measures .
christians are usually persecuted by extremist groups .
however , this presents a danger to all christians , jews and muslims .
this is why the provocation that occurred at the christmas celebrations last january was particularly blatant and premeditated .
that is to say , there are many quarters where religious values are not respected .
so I welcome this resolution .
egypt's constitution provides for freedom of belief and free practice of religion .
unfortunately , no country is immune from this .
the vote will take place at 12.00 .
written statements rule 149 
the fact that he is referred to by different names is absolutely secondary .
europe views all this with relative indifference .
another year , 2010 , has started with the bloody persecution of christians in many parts of the world .
a few weeks ago , the chinese government disregarded an eu appeal not to execute a british citizen .
author . mr president , china has demonstrated impressive economic progress .
the naming and shaming strategy that we apply every month is a last resort .
it is this respect that is missing in the resolution .
the hosting of the olympic games in beijing last year did not have the results that some had expected .
the relationship that the european union is able to maintain with china is of particular importance .
it is our duty as meps to say loudly and clearly what we consider important and what is unacceptable .
however , that fact should not stop us from raising these issues in parliament .
we take it seriously because china really matters .
i believe , as also suggested by mrs hautala earlier , that dialogue is not sufficient for human rights .
moreover , entrepreneurs who invest in china must be asked to follow precise rules regarding workersrights .
if this does not happen , we will remain accomplices who wish to deny these people their freedom .
gao's open letters to the regime in 2005 set the tone for charter 0i believe the authorities should now produce gao zhisheng and release him .
at the same time , google is visibly calling for freedom of speech for chinese internet users .
everyone assumes that he has probably been killed in one terrible way or another .
we all hoped that it would , but it did not work .
therefore , we should not let up with our urgent appeals .
the strength of our relationship allows us to discuss those matters frankly .
to achieve this , we must continue to work on the development of our strategic partnership .
i would like to react to a question from mrs de keyser .
the vote will take place at 12.00 .
it was , in fact , about the way in which it was conveyed .
their decision to start to operate an unfiltered search engine in china deserves the warmest congratulations .
there have been recurring violations of human rights in china , and we cannot omit to condemn them .
since that day , neither his family nor his loved ones have had any news of him .
murders are committed with total impunity , and the perpetrators are very rarely brought to justice .
this makes it the greatest massacre of journalists in world history .
the perpetrators belong to a local militia and some local police officers were involved .
the government has not shown any discernible will to take decisive steps to counter this development .
there is a danger of there being further political murders .
quite recently , 57 people were murdered , half of them journalists .
so many mistakes have been made in the investigation that it almost authorises the use of force in politics .
we cannot always be acting based on headlines .
pl mr president , defence of human rights is the trademark of the european union .
this is , truly , an absolutely unacceptable situation .
i will be very brief , because we want to vote .
on this occasion , the government has acted swiftly and has taken decisive action to prosecute the perpetrators .
that is very welcome .
debates on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law
human rights violations in china , notably the case of liu xiaobo vote 
we have just voted through a series of resolutions condemning human rights abuses in china .
see how hypocrisy has been elevated into a governing principle !
let us remember that the danube is the second longest river in europe , after the volga .
i am also talking about member states of the european union .

monday 
i will talk to mr barroso about this .
does anyone want to speak against the request ?
they can therefore be seen together , examined together and debated together .
mr president , if I can make one very small point of order .
mr president , we believe that the item on madagascar is not particularly important today .
mumia abu jamal has been sentenced to death and has been waiting on death row for 30 years .
in any case , the death sentence is one of the clearest violations of human rights we know .
i think that we can save madagascar .
one minute speeches on matters of political importance
the next item is the one minute speeches on matters of political importance .
i think it would be important to have adequate communication and dialogue between the eu institutions .
please convey this , to ensure that my work is not hindered and that I receive the answers requested .
mr president , sometimes , colleagues in this parliament make life very difficult for its friends .
i have been dealing with codecision legislation for more than 10 years .
we should not be doing things for which we cannot account .
in addition , there is also an ecological aspect to the unfavourable impact of building the gas pipeline .
they also discussed other major issues .
this does not improve airport security .
this begs the question as to whether our concern with security in airports is exaggerated .
however , the second matter is belarus .
thank you very much .
this would be another terrible blow to the standard of living of working people .
the prophet says kill the jews . 
these statements are downright loathsome , and I take the view that this cannot be without consequences .
finally , we will fight in favour of permanent and up to date support for fisheries in the outermost regions .
sl europe is full of minorities , and ethnic minorities represent a significant part of those .
such a situation was incongruous .
what obstacles can the eu erect to prevent gambling operations in member states ?
mr president , I wish to speak on energy policy .
this is a further act of repression against the polish minority in belarus .
the report by mrs alvarez on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation ,
the report by mr domenici on promoting good governance in tax matters ,
this is all about loyalty between member states and their tax administrations .
the third new element is the lifting of banking secrecy .
finally , I should like to thank my fellow committee members for their work and their willingness to cooperate .
they are to be congratulated on their attitude .
this type of fraud , as I have already mentioned , is known as missing trader intra community fraud .
these are issued by national governments and between 5 and 10 % of these are auctioned off .
we must put a stop to the practice of creating fictitious legal entities to evade tax .
the point is that we need increasing tax cooperation and collaboration in the european union .
i do not wish to dwell on the tangible proposals that the report contains .
the commission has tabled several proposals in order to improve good governance within the eu .
these limits have to be respected , so a public register may not be the best solution .
the other concern is transfer pricing .
let me now turn to the commission's proposal on mutual assistance for the recovery of taxes .
i very much welcome the supporting attitude to this proposal shown in the report by mr stolojan .
i regret , however , that their struggle for citizensfreedoms is changeable and inconsistent .
yet that is not the case .
have a happy retirement , commissioner .
the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under rule 149 8 
pt mrs lulling , I would only like to ask you one question .
we must also emphasise the extent to which a healthy fiscal policy is essential .
i wish you all the best .
taxation , particularly any form of harmonisation , is always a sensitive issue .
tax competition is a jolly good thing .
cooperation would cease and national security would be put at risk .
i urge members to approach these reports pragmatically .
we need to ensure that we do not indulge in needless harmonisation which endangers national security .
back then , we used to pay millions of schillings every year .
the domenici report gives an account of how to close those back doors .
i know that commissioner kovács has doubts about this , but I think work could begin in that direction .
i think that by continuing on these paths , we can move towards a more honest tax policy .
the work on the report on the reverse charge mechanism has been very constructive .
first , administrative cooperation between states on fiscal matters is a key question for the internal market .
i sincerely hope that it will be adopted on wednesday at our plenary sitting .
an answer of which , I believe , we can only be proud .
firstly , high rates of tax .
the higher taxes are , the more taxpayers will look for ways to circumvent their tax obligations .
the second important reason for tax evasion is the opacity and complexity of tax systems .
the more exemptions , the more fraud .
however , introducing this system of automatic information exchange would inevitably involve increasing the size of the bureaucratic machine .
to sum up , then , an automatic exchange of information upon request .
this document goes much wider and demands automatic exchange in all areas .
laws must be transparent and administrative bodies must also act in an appropriate manner .
these four reports , particularly those of mr domenici and mrs alvarez , are along these lines .
we may criticise the tax burden in our own countries .
the most effective way to exchange information is to do so automatically .
it has been a privilege to cooperate with you .
thank you and good luck .
it is necessary because tax evasion is no mere peccadillo .
it affects countries across borders .
it may well be though that such purchase is necessary .
we need to strike a balance between the two and not allow one interest to prevail over the other .
furthermore , cross border dual taxation should be a subject of greater focus .
we have to consider that .
finally , I would like to wish commissioner kovács every success in his future endeavours .
that can hardly have been the intention at least , not in my view .
nevertheless , many citizens do not welcome the paying of taxes with open arms and with a smile .
that came up in the lisbon treaty in the guarantees given to ireland .
a good tax system relies on a fair and broad tax base and reasonable levels of taxation .
as we have heard here , gross domestic product is now at crisis point in different parts of europe .
most controversial of all with respect to these directives has been the matter of information exchange .
however , those being crucified on the euro are not pigs but people , scourged by utopian one size fits all dogma .
the eu needs common legislation , enforced uniformly in all member states for combating tax fraud and evasion .
compulsory social security contributions will also be included from the start of this year .
therefore , the main message of these reports is that we must forge better cooperation in europe .
de mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the fight against tax fraud is a necessity .
germany's neighbour , switzerland , has voiced concerns that it is being placed under pressure .
my personal view is that switzerland cannot afford to treat the eu any less well than the usa .
therefore , that means that switzerland must actually join in our concerted efforts to fight tax evasion .
i was pleased to hear that many of you encouraged the commission to be more ambitious .
i also see general support for the three proposals .
it cannot be justified by resorting to such feeble arguments as the high tax regimes in certain fiscal systems .
we must certainly persevere in our efforts to simplify the various fiscal systems .
they are also eager for their representatives to take appropriate measures to deal with the matter .
we have to ensure that we do not penalise honest citizens who pay and do not evade tax .
the aim is to make everyone pay , so that each individual has to pay less .
in writing . I just wish to raise one particular point regarding cooperation on taxation between member states .
there is just a note of caution I wish to give my colleagues in parliament .
we need strong measures , simple , transparent laws and , by extension , less bureaucracy .
therefore , I shall be endorsing the report by mrs alvarez with conviction .
gm / opel current developments debate 
the commission will continue , of course , to monitor closely all developments within the opel group .
the possibility of belgium presenting a request for assistance under the european globalisation adjustment fund has been discussed .
we believe that the position of general motors in europe is unacceptable .
there is just one item on the agenda the enhancement of european economic cooperation .
thousands of people men and women and their families face a gloomy future .
perhaps .
i am also disappointed with your response and position today , however .
only then will there be a clear vision for both industrial policy and a social europe .
state aid can be provided only for the development of new , innovative products .
we have already held this debate , last september .
this is the way people feel .
noels believes this is the reason for the closure of opel antwerp .
let us look to the future for once .
what is the situation with the chemical industry in flanders ?
the car industry must also contend with the consequences of an anti car policy propagated by the greens .
cars are being rendered unaffordable , as people should be taking the bus .
cars are becoming too expensive for people on lower incomes .
all that you have done is defend the general motors plan .
in other words , the european taxpayer pays and the whole deal is underwritten by the swedish government .
why are we saving jobs in mexico with european taxpayersmoney ?
can we not rebody vectras at the ellesmere port plant in my constituency ?
for that is all saab has been reduced to .
i should like to conclude by addressing a few words to the representatives of the belgian parties in office .
the european taxpayer and opel's other workers in europe should not foot that bill .
nobody will understand that over there !
yet your colleague , commissioner kroes , made us very clear promises in the september plenary .
some months ago , we discussed here the possibility of financial assistance to opel from the german government .
globalisation will bring changes and we are seeing enterprises relocate their operations to other parts of the world .
this situation will affect the plant at figueruelas in spain too , and all who are employed there .
the commission cannot remain a mere observer .
i endorse it completely .
what lies ahead for europe's industrial policy ?
this figure is 20 % in countries such as latvia and spain .
what does this have to do with morality ?
it is clear that the commission has room for manoeuvre within the framework of the treaty .
this is what we did and this is what we continue to do .
we must keep them in mind too .
equality between women and men in the european union 2009 debate 
i believe therefore that men must also make a commitment to combat violence against women .
59.1 % of women work today .
obviously , I believe that we have to combat sexist stereotypes .
sexual and reproductive rights are an important chapter because women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights .
let us turn to paternity leave .
by way of illustration , I will mention three of these .
the current european parliament , for example , has its highest ever percentage of women 35 % .
the third notable initiative is the introduction of the european institute for gender equality .
no .
the latter exists today to prevent pregnancy at a very early age .
first of all , my compliments to the rapporteur .
let us just concentrate on specific measures .
it is brimful of plans that we want carried out .
we hope that the commission will take action accordingly .
no faith at all is needed , today , to see a person in an unborn human foetus .
therefore , every responsible legislator should do everything possible to make the number of abortions fall .
it says that women are of a lower status than men .
it says that , under inheritance law , a man's portion must be double that of a woman .
surely this is a case of blatant gender discrimination .
europe is boldly marching backwards to sixth century arabia .
and we do not really know yet what the consequences of the crisis will be .
in a europe struggling with a demographic crisis , this in itself is disturbing and totally unacceptable .
the majority of the almost 80 million people living in poverty in europe are women and children .
women are suffering more than anybody else in the economic and social crisis .
you , mr špidla , have recognised that we need new legal action .
i would like to highlight two things in particular .
what would be the use of a new charter of women's rights ?
there is none .
it is a mistake to believe that a charter will solve women's problems .
no one can say that the legal instruments ignore women's rights .
that would be intellectually dishonest and factually incorrect .
we must acknowledge that definite progress has been made with regard to equality .
i want to emphasise three particular points .
if we truly wish to move towards real equality , then paternity leave must be introduced at european level .
i want to stress , therefore , the great importance of implementation and supervision .
tomorrow , we will be ratifying the new european commission , of which women make up only a third .
however , it does not refer specifically to domestic violence .
in greece , for example , 35 spouse murders have been recorded over the past eighteen months .
and yet , support structures for abused women are basic or even non existent .
the police found her resting in a sitting position buried two metres below ground .
the pvv wants to see this backwardness combated with vigour .
it is time for a new wave of emancipation .
women in business , women at work that is what we clamour for .
therefore , the economy should be working to support families and women .
first and foremost , however , we need to effectively put all the equality laws into practice .
de madam president , we have the european year against poverty and exclusion .
women are still at a very high risk of becoming poor or having to live in poverty .
they then decide to have children , which often leads them to only be able to work part time .
these periods add up and , as a result , women's professional careers progress much more slowly .
thank you and good luck !
we must , together , make such proposals .
we have the results of polls which show this .
critical mass is essential to bring about change .
important efforts are being made and we need to emphasise that .
we need to create the conditions for that to become a reality .
quite simply , our competitiveness is at stake .
we have had a recent court case involving an incident of that kind in ireland .
then there will be no need for quotas .
heckling 
well then , in your case , we can talk about real equality .
equality does pay off !
ro while welcoming this report , I would like to highlight one thing .
i would like to emphasis one further thing .
thirdly , the area of entrepreneurship .
the european union currently has waiting lists for children to be registered in crèches and nurseries .
in the private sector , women are much better represented , with a third of them .
i believe that we cannot adopt a negative or positive opinion a priori on any remedy .
i wish you all the best and god bless !
the vote will take place on wednesday , 10 february .
written statements rule 149 
we have the necessary legal instruments to act on this .
closure of the sitting
the sitting was closed at 22.50 
opening of the sitting
welcome , everyone .
we have completed the hearings , and I have received 26 letters of recommendation .
for the first time in history , we are electing the european commission as a co equal legislator .
this puts us under an obligation to work especially closely with the european commission .
there are also many solutions in our new framework agreement which we did not have before .
it shall exercise coordinating , executive and management functions , as laid down in the treaties .
thus , today , we are seeing european democracy in action .
the team standing before you today is ready to rise to the challenges ahead of it .
this is a team for which you can vote with confidence , a team that deserves your support .
then what ?
our task is to use the new mechanics to bring on new dynamics .
let us move the discussion from institutional input to policy impact .
the european union has the necessary framework to address all challenges that can appear in this matter .
and the answer isyes.
frankly , I believe we have to do more .
to achieve these goals , we must recognise that the interdependence of our economies requires better and more coordination .
during this mandate , we will also focus on the budget review and new financial perspectives .
this is no time for our institutions to pull in different directions .
let us work together to make it a real success for all our citizens .
the presentation was given by mr barroso .
we are discussing both of these matters .
that is an order that has taken a vow of silence .
the commission is strong when it acts as a collegial body .
an answer to the question of whether the european union counts in the world could be seen in copenhagen .
applause 
i am delighted that there are eight liberal commissioners in charge of some very important portfolios .
in tomorrow's world and in the multipolar world , we need much more than that .
we need socio economic governance of the european union .
i do not believe you , but I am going to vote for you anyway.
so , this is really .
you are not the president of parliament yet !
we have some large groups , which are going to support the barroso commission .
we need to know whether this commission will have a vision , ambition and determination .
what has been said is true .
in spain , where is it ?
the problem is cyprus it is the relationship with turkey .
the same point has been made with regard to haiti .
baroness ashton , I know that you are not a fire fighter , a midwife or any other such person .
we want a political europe .
when , in copenhagen , europe was due to make progress , we blew it !
he is not saying why he did not play his role .
we are against , we are against , but we will vote in favour . 
we would be delighted if you fully lived up to that reputation in this election period .
i would like you to return to that idea , as it was a good one .
i wish you much success in this .
poor greece , trapped inside the modern day völkerkerker for which it appears there is no way out !
what greece needs , mr barroso , is devaluation , not sado monetarism .
today we haveshared values.
article 121 will be invoked with all of those .
it cannot work .
we need democratic solutions to this .
we must put the future of europe to people in every member state in free and fair referendums .
hu the european commission is the european union's defining decision making body .
this means that I am trying to find a coat to match the button .
in the course of the hearings , the commissioners designate scarcely said anything concrete .
we are simply doing what our voters many million european citizens expect of us .
ladies and gentlemen , when my computer is not working , I press the restart button .
let us not always make ourselves out to be worse than we are !
we now have a member of the commission who was responsible for the council .
this is not the case here .
we work on them so that our own ideas , too , are incorporated .
let us seize this opportunity with the new commission , a new treaty and a new framework agreement .
let us , as parliament , be confident in our dealings with the commission .
mr president , I hope it is worth waiting for .
today , in wales , the national assembly is starting the process for a referendum on more law making powers .
in catalonia , in scotland , in flanders and elsewhere , there are changes taking place .
do you really think this composition of the college will allow the union to strengthen its position ?
in my group , however , we completely disagree with this political project .
let me give an example .
i therefore draw the conclusion that this commission accepts social dumping .
fi mr president , in finland we are commemorating the winter war .
they cannot .
the eu is a bureaucracy and not a democracy .
here they might get 300 votes , but that is about it .
what lies at the heart of democracy ?
you are going to have many people to deal with .
we therefore unreservedly support the commission led by mr barroso .
we all need to change our attitude .
unfortunately , however , this does not surprise me .
de mr president , I finally have the feeling that things are starting to happen .
please be courageous and make europe strong , both inside and out .
the internal market is not functioning well enough for small and medium sized enterprises .
for this , we need a strong europe .
i am pleased that the commission has now put forward a proposal .
the single vote must end .
there is no point in telling me that joaquín almunia did not say what he did .
that is the first problem , and the second is one of signals .
i am not completely happy with the results of the impact assessment .
what I fear most is the widening gap between citizensexpectations and brusselslittle world .
i believe we cannot impose one size fits all solutions .
you will need to be visionary and creative to take europe out of the gloomy past .
de mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we now have a second barroso commission .
the first two commissions , led by mr santer and mr prodi , were both collegial bodies .
that is better for europe and better for cooperation with parliament .
the citizens have expectations you spoke of being bold with regard to the european agenda .
two groups have decided to totally oppose you the greens and the communists .
the president cut off the speaker 
the first aspect was cast into doubt during the hearings .
can we trust the commission ?
there are , in fact , many things to be done .
my best wishes , president barroso !
he has succeeded in this .
so , mr barroso , do not be scared , be bold !
the prospect of a return to strong growth has never been so distant .
the disparity between our competences and our financial resources has never been so great .
applause 
i believe that we all need to be interested in making this a success .
now , all of them will do so .
you said that social impact assessments are important to you .
we deplore the fact that we are absent from the high level group .
we think we should be involved in the process which was always requested by this house .
otherwise , it will be weaker , whereas both sides want it to be stronger .
mr president , the european community is more than 50 years old now .
baroness ashton , you are the one who should and must be the united voice of europe .
it is not only a matter of good coordination or consulting the member states .
you need to lead the way , including in matters relating to the financial crisis .
political observers agree that the new commission contains no real political heavyweights .
i wish the new european commission every success and good luck for the future .
that is what the 500 million europeans who are watching us are expecting right now .
pl mr president , the european union is in a completely new situation .
the initial experience gained over the past two months gives rise to a variety of doubts .
the point being that we need strong personalities and strong faces .
no !
mr president , structural funds have been so important for regions like wales in the past and currently .
they have helped many individuals , communities and businesses .
the biggest reason for that , in my experience , is the absence of bank managers .
then we will have overcome the crisis .
i would like an answer to that .
of course , it was affected by the crisis .
non euro area countries were also affected by the crisis .
we have yet to reap the full benefits of the euro .
such analyses usually come from non euro area countries .
we have our system of fiscal rules , the stability and growth pact , which must be properly implemented .
in the case of greece , we have the capacity to assess and monitor its fiscal adjustment programme .
i welcome clear indications that all member states are aware of the challenge and will act accordingly .
there was a concrete question asked about consumer policy , I think by mrs gebhardt .
more and more issues are transversal or horizontal by nature .
we are committed to introducing this social impact assessment in our work through the impact assessment board .
some members of this parliament put questions to me regarding energy security .
that is not what we are proposing .
i am very committed to this , and we must strive to achieve it together .
applause 
i am in favour of enhanced governance of europe , and europe needs this enhanced governance .
the international financial crisis has shown just how interdependent our economies are .
where in the world does europe count ?
it is respected in trade terms , I can assure you of that .
we have a common policy .
we have the basis on which to act .
this is not about making things more difficult , quite the opposite !
we need the various institutions .
that is our system .
we have a system that is an improvement on the internal system .
i shall conclude by making an appeal to this house .
with power comes responsibility .
i can tell you that I am ready to make efforts along those lines .
the commission does not want their support .
however , the commission wants and requests the support of all the european forces .
applause 
we are aware of the responsibility which rests on the european parliament .
the debate is closed .
i should like to add a thought on the citizensright of initiative .
parliament has no power of initiative but it does have the power to request that the commission initiate legislation .
a new era in the integration of a fairer europe which shows greater solidarity .
we cannot but vote against this new commission .
the sitting was suspended at 12.10 and resumed at 13.30 
thank you very much , and congratulations once again .
thank you , mr lópez garrido , secretary of state for european affairs in the spanish government .
we are proud and humbled by the vote .
but let me just make a comment .
in the european union , we have a democratic european parliament , and this is democracy .
there are 16 members who wish to give an explanation of vote .
each of the speakers will have one minute .
it is overcoming it , although we are not yet out of the woods .
applause 
that is , I know , what the new commission is going to strive to achieve with us .
it must not deprive itself of the tools that come with its power .
europe is a permanent compromise .
applause 
of course , we all enjoy a tussle .
we asked whether we could introduce a social impact assessment into european union legislation as a regulatory mechanism .
in recent weeks and months , we have voiced many concerns , including in our debate this morning .
when I sayyou, I mean the college of commissioners .
the s & d group will support this commission .
our support is conditional , more so than during the last five years .
a strong commission may be helpful , but a strong commission in that respect is indispensable .
high representative ashton , we ask you to use these new tools .
applause 
not with us , the european greens .
the council tells us you will be told that at the end of the negotiations.
if you want to solve the cyprus problem , you will have our support .
some of them made a thoroughly positive impression on us .
we are less enthusiastic about the new arrangement of many of the portfolios .
however , we found many of the candidates disappointing in terms of their specialist knowledge .
in what direction should the european integration process go ?
nothing has been said about consistent disarmament , especially with regard to nuclear weapons within europe .
applause 
there is more .
i promise you , there is more .
the politicians in charge became very greedy they wanted money for themselves and they wanted power .
but they did not need to use any bullets to do it .
what they did is they put in place a new treaty it was called the lisbon treaty .
these would have been the people who made all the laws .
presumably not .
mr barroso , there are very many experienced parliamentarians here in parliament that you could adorn yourself with .
because you are not allowed to .
that is a type of democracy that we had in austria in the 19th century .
no true european .
the president cut off the speaker 
no true european and no true democrat can , in all conscience , support these candidates .
the agreement adopted today will form an important basis for this .
i very much expect us in this house to be able to debate the swift agreement once more .
quite honestly , there was no alternative .
mr verhofstadt , the liberal alternative , and mr juncker , the federalist alternative , were not acceptable .
there is also another fact .
a number of its members were members of the communist party , or were associated with it .
europe is sleep walking towards disaster .
at the end of the day , only an effective europe can also be a social europe .
when signing international treaties , european parliament experts will also be included in the discussions .
for this reason , I have voted against the motion for a resolution .
however , we are pleased to vote with anybody , if we agree with what they propose .
the barroso ii commission is a mixed bunch .
that does not make it any easier to assess this commission as a whole .
yet what they really stand for is even now still unclear sometimes .
however , there are other things going on .
one commissioner , who is also the first vice president , gives us fundamental concerns .
we cannot support this unjustified institutionally risky venture .
it is , in fact , a fine team bringing together individuals with varied and complementary backgrounds .
the majority of the commissioners represent the liberal stance of the european union that we reject .
the new barroso commission has been approved by the european parliament by a large majority .
of course , I also voted in favour of it .
moreover , recent developments have sadly highlighted the inability of that team to get to grips with events .
no criteria relating to specialised knowledge were applied in the selection process .
i voted in favour of the newbarroso iicommission .
consequently , the vote to appoint the commission was a mere formality , anadministrative yes.
europe cannot , therefore , afford to have commissioners who are only now going to learn their portfolios .
in writing . we all wish this new commission well .
she will play a critical role in europe's recovery and I wish her well with this .
the framework agreement between the european parliament and the commission on their future cooperation also leaves many questions unanswered .
however , the interinstitutional agreement does contain some important steps in the right direction .
the impact of all measures taken by the commission is to be assessed regularly by an independent party .
finally , the european commission will undertake to submit a report on its legislative initiatives within three months .
i have therefore votedyestoday to the new barroso commission .
therefore , I call strongly for the european commission to begin taking action without delay .
we have had to wait a long time for the new european commission .
it should , however , be admitted that the new commission did receive the overwhelming majority of the votes .
the committee on industry , research and energy is responsible for research , energy and developing the information society .
research and innovation are major driving forces for change .
mr barroso committed to 3 % investment in research and development .
the commission has made a clearer commitment in this regard .
the future of the economy is the future of the green economy .
barroso is not the powerful leader we need .
he allowed five extremely crucial years to pass by .
as we all know , the european parliament votes only on the composition of the entire commission .
we can be truly proud .
this will save valuable taxpayersmoney .
there are also some who definitely have the potential to develop .
the european parliament is not giving a blank cheque to mr barroso and the college of commissioners .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting see minutes
difficult monetary , economic and social situation of eurozone countries debate 
we need to move from monetary union towards true economic union , as stated in the treaties .
plans for the later years of the programme are less detailed at this stage .
some of the fiscal consolidation measures have already been submitted to the greek parliament and should be implemented shortly .
what are the next steps in this very detailed process of surveillance ?
the same must also apply to other countries in the danger zone .
i would also like to extend this wish to your successor , mr rehn .
i wish him courage and luck for the important tasks he is taking on .
there are three things we can learn from the present situation .
there are also countries that have to do more , because they are able to do more .
the third thing we can learn is that the european union must be armed .
i would say to the council and the commission be prepared for the need to negotiate .
neither should it be said that nobody was aware of greece's problems .
you will have our political group's full support in this undertaking .
what does this mean ?
if so , which ones ?
the eu , through the ecb , cannot impose fiscal criteria on these member states .
when the market questioned the business model and refused to lend , the business model de facto collapsed .
greece has to raise eur 31 billion over the next few weeks .
they have failed resoundingly .
the crisis does not only concern greece .
with the lisbon strategy , we have dismantled the social state .
we therefore need to change the stability pact and replace it with a development and employment pact .
i never imagined the euro area becoming a zone in which there is no solidarity .
nl greece only recently gave an insight into the actual extent of its debts .
europe must not bring in a trojan horse .
you are continuing as normal with your disastrous policy .
lastly , courage must be shown in order to tax speculative capital movements .
now it is strangling greece and other client states of the euro .
this should be a warning for any country outside the eurozone .
believe me , ladies and gentlemen , without a sustainable economy , it will be impossible to balance finances .
we have to say how we have ended up here .
what are the affected countries doing to get themselves out of debt ?
the lisbon strategy did not work because it had neither means nor instruments .
the speculators did indeed profit from your statements .
however , they should not form this basis alone .
both strategies need to be supported by sustainable growth and employment policy .
when the euro was strengthened , what were the speculators then ?
in fact , the dollar and the euro form a duopoly .
a duopoly will always be unstable .
what these countries need is solidarity and the right signals .
they were unfortunate and imprudent statements which had immediate effects on the market .
behind them , however , the entire euro area is at risk .
of course , reductions in defence spending have been planned in the budget for 20the ministry of national defence has a budget of eur 6 billion , down 6.63 % .
i wish we would see a change in the arms diplomacy that has brought us to this impasse .
greece has no colonies to exploit , but it does have staying power .
instead , they take the opportunity to seize greater control while you are on your knees .
who is next , spain , portugal , italy or ireland ?
for this , absolutely crucial and forceful measures are needed .
the problem is not that the markets were reserved , as you said .
pl the situation which has arisen in some countries in the euro area requires serious consideration .
secondly , the discipline of the stability and growth pact was not maintained .
how can we fight this ?
i think that today's test does not have any one country's name on it .
madam president , thank you for indulging so many one minute speeches on this issue .
there have been abundant rumours in this regard .
how do you intend to deal with such a difficult issue in future ?
no government can long afford to spend more money than it collects in tax revenues .
furthermore , we do not believe that the stability and growth pact is in crisis .
mr canfin asked me what proposals the spanish presidency has in this respect .
the union shall take measures to ensure coordination of the employment policies . 
the union may take initiatives to ensure coordination of [ . ] social policies . 
allow me to say a few things , which I will say in four points .
this is not a statistical matter .
eurostat receives notifications from the member states .
the commission asked for those powers and the council did not grant them .
i have told the council that we are going to ask it for those powers again .
it is a special council meeting because there are not many matters on the table .
this system should function almost in real time .
the sitting was suspended for a few minutes 
others gave background support .
the best response to the terrorists is criminal convictions .
it is exemplary . it must serve as an example .
es madam president , I would like to emphasise the point raised recently by mrs flautre .
ladies and gentlemen of the council and the commission , this historical responsibility cannot be allowed under any circumstances .
pl madam president , I would like to start with what the previous speaker said here .
the european union and the united states have worked very thoroughly on this issue .
i think that this is very clear when we look at the measures that president obama has adopted .
he has put an end to theenhancedinterrogation techniques , also by the cia .
the debate is closed .
this means that there will only be restrictions and prohibitions on international fishing fleets , not local fishing .
it is therefore difficult at this time to give detailed answers on these issues .
the european union is one of the major markets for wildlife products .
the first is atlantic bluefin tuna .
i have to repeat here that there is no final position on this issue .
we also believe that it is worth checking how any additional threat to this species might be mitigated .
bluefin tuna is in immediate danger of extinction .
so the scientific part of the debate has been resolved .
we have a commissioner and a minister just going through the motions .
species have dropped by 80 to 90 % .
we are facing extinction and you have a body which is set up supposedly to look after the tuna !
the targets which it has set itself will fail completely .
it ignores scientific advice it keeps setting quotas far , far too high .
however , we must concede that attempts are being made to weaken that resolution behind the scenes .
this is crucial for the survival of this species .
we are talking about fishing quotas , conservation , maintaining habitats , and so on and so forth .
it also explains the enormous illegal catches which are estimated to be twice the size of the set quotas .
the only salvation for the bluefin tuna is an international trade ban .
this is the real problem for bluefin tuna .
over the last 50 years , the population of this species has fallen by as much as 75 % .
it would therefore weaken international governance of the seas and the principle of responsible fishing .
we need to get to the root of the problems .
for example , in 2006 , the total allowable catch was 36 000 tonnes .
that is certainly not a sensible way to proceed .
sv mr president , ladies and gentlemen , look around you in this chamber .
fr mr president , today there remains less than 15 % of the original bluefin tuna stock .
nevertheless , we should not forget about the jobs affected by the decision that we are discussing today .
what will the new control and penalty measures consist of ?
it is deeply flawed to put tigers , polar bears , elephants and tuna on equal terms .
in some ways , the same goes for the issue of coral and for its inclusion in appendix ii .
the canadian coast provides a good example of how man succeeded in totally destroying cod stocks .
that is something that we should reflect on .
nonetheless , I think that the committee's proposal is a good one .
in my view , the best and most appropriate way is to include it in appendix ii .
european fishermen face strong often unfair competition from north african countries .
unilateral viability of tuna populations makes no sense .
we must ensure that everyone is playing the game by the same rules .
in catalonia , hundreds of jobs are at stake .
if not , then I would like to be told that .
however , ladies and gentlemen of the commission , I would go one step further .
it is possible to reconcile these two .
i advocate the need to control fishing .
i therefore propose that this identity marking be taken to doha as a useful contribution to the debate .
we know that the council has parliament's full support in this .
this is an important matter because it relates mainly to the catches by the eu fishing fleets .
the practical impact of such a listing would be uncertain .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on wednesday at 12 noon .
including coral in appendix ii therefore seems excessive and uncorroborated by scientific data .
for these reasons , we are against the inclusion of this species family in cites appendix ii .
of course , we have to be pragmatic .
putting bft on appendix I of cites would cost my country's economy close to 2 % of gdp .
it is no different than asking to close down the whole salmon industry in scotland in one swipe .
nearly 1 % of the labour force would lose their jobs .
it was linked to other areas , which is why an agreement was not reached under the swedish presidency .
furthermore , the arrangement will apply to every country in the european union .
the idea of cohesion continues to be a combination of social cohesion , economic cohesion and territorial cohesion .
i think it really is very good that we are now able to take this decision .
the creation of new marginalised areas , although with decent and erdf supported houses , is definitively not our objective .
this , in turn , has led to the most disadvantaged families being driven away from the city centres .
people living in these places earn the lowest pay and are often unemployed or dependent on social handouts .
i firmly believe , however , that mere physical investment in infrastructure will not solve the problems of ghettos .
they will be angry should any of these measures facilitate yet more eu mass immigration .
it is about space , not race .
it focuses , in particular , on the roma people and also on legal migrants .
it helps to finance specific projects to the benefit of regions , towns and villages and their inhabitants .
in the 21st century , there are many groups of people living in demeaning conditions .
the issue of the living conditions of the roma is linked to that of the opening up of borders .
this is an eminently european issue .
to own the hearth , the stool and all !
the new text stipulates a rate of 4 % .
i firmly believe that this financial imbalance must be corrected .
this would dramatically expand the range of possible interventions and increase the effectiveness of the measures .
local governments and non governmental organisations should join the efforts to help in the area of tackling social exclusion .
i want to stress that all people deserve and need social housing that is fit for purpose .
these are issues that we need to address as well .
i would encourage this house to look at this as part of the problem of housing in marginalised communities .
the vulnerability of these communities has tangibly increased during the current period of economic crisis .
secondly , two comments on the substance of the debate .
finally , let me welcome this debate which sets out parliament's commitment to the inclusion of marginalised communities .
a second point is that it is , in a manner of speaking , a voluntary framework .
the debate is closed .
we must focus on the real solutions .

2009 progress report on croatia
the agreement was signed on 4 november in stockholm and ratified by the croatian parliament on 20 november .
as I said , we have a great deal of work ahead of us .
the european parliament , as you know , has taken note of these council conclusions of 8 december 200all of these topics are reflected in various sections of parliament's resolution .
i would also like to congratulate him because it is his first day in office .
your report thus reinforces the messages and supports the work undertaken by the commission .
croatia has come a long way over recent years but important challenges still remain to be tackled .
as regards the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , 2009 was a good year as regards its reform process .
this is a landmark achievement in civilian military relations .
we continue to support the democratic opening launched by the government .
croatia has shown that no one is outside the law or exempt from measures to combat corruption .
this sends out an important signal .
i hope that the same thing will happen soon in slovenia .
the point has already been made that the fight against corruption is an important element .
nevertheless , I hope that croatia does everything in its power in this respect .
2009 was a good year for the candidate country of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia fyrom .
secondly , fyrom was the first country in the region to comply with all the visa liberalisation requirements .
last week , the fyrom parliament passed a resolution on srebrenica .
solidarity must be mutual .
we need to bear in mind that the balkans is like a bicycle ride .
i will begin with open debate , democratic opening .
mr president , we have clear expectations of the council and the commission .
we expect negotiations with croatia to be completed and negotiations with macedonia to be started this year .
this will allow croatia , if it is treated fairly , to complete the negotiations this year .
i believe that this will also be the case today .
croatia is their homeland , too .
let me conclude by wishing mr füle , our new commissioner , every success .
i know he will do an excellent job .
i think there was good cooperation in the process and I thank my colleagues .
we would like to see more transparency and less political influence in this area as well .
however , candidates must be subject to rigorous and exacting standards as laid out in the copenhagen criteria .
we mean this and we believe in it .
as such , we declare that we disagree with the position that the relevant energy chapter should be opened .
i am sure that everyone will help .
however , is this not unacceptably making everyone equally responsible , making the victim and the occupier equally responsible ?
we need to send out a clear message on that point .
in montenegro , for example , the existence of homosexuality is finally being recognised .
however , we also need to avoid watering down the power of the accession process by erecting extra obstacles .
bilateral problems , in themselves , should not represent an obstacle to the accession process .
i am sure that you will also begin the process of negotiation with macedonia soon .
our new ally has bravely supported our fight against terrorism in several nato missions .
let us remember this , too , when we look at our eastern neighbour , ukraine .
is it heading towards a multicultural europe or towards a pan islamic state ?
the issue of the abolition of visas , in particular , has outraged the secular state in turkey .
neither of these promises has been kept .
this context , commissioner , means that the turkish case needs to be handled with great caution .
mr president , first , could I repeat in public my own congratulations to commissioner füle .
on turkey , the socialist and democrat group remains pro accession , pro reform .
to our cypriot colleagues we understand the pain of injustice you feel .
to others in this house , constructive criticism of turkey is needed we ourselves are critical friends .
the fact is , a few years ago , these crimes did not make the headlines .
first of all , could I call for more honesty in our approach to turkey .
why are so few chapters open ?
i agree that the turkish garrison in northern cyprus should be much reduced .
i would request that the commission look into this and act proactively in relation to it .
both of these things relate to the european perspective , but they use different toolboxes .
for this reason , you have an interesting job and I hope very much that you enjoy it .
i am pleased to follow my distinguished friend , mr brok , who mentioned the copenhagen criteria .
why is this important ?
bring in anti discrimination legislation now .
turkey is moving forwards and backwards .
we think that is very good .
there is also theprivate waragainst the doğan group .
another example is that of the role of women .
i would also like to say something about what mr howitt has said .
our primary responsibility is to the european union .
there is an accession perspective , but accession will only come about when all the criteria have been met .
you said that the group of the greens / european free alliance wanted enlargement at any price .
this is very important .
a europe without that balkan lung is not europe .
fathers still sell their daughters or swap them for cattle .
this is a political reality .
on this matter , the progress report indicates that there is still much to do .
we must give a clearyesorno.
when they reform , they are becoming neighbours .
the time to act is now .
in the case of both countries , issues concerning neighbourly relations have stalled progress .
these reforms must be initiated and implemented and , above all , they must be supported by the population .
however , good intentions are not everything .
turkey has indeed made good progress , but many points of concern must be addressed urgently .
the horrible phenomenon of honour killings must be stamped out as well as the killing of transgender persons .
just yesterday , we learned of the umpteenth killing of a transgender woman in antalya .
applause 
madam president , I should like to welcome commissioner füle and the minister .
however , there are important differences .
we are all delighted that this country will shortly be joining the european union .
however , we cannot have à la carte accession tailored to turkey .
we expect an equally honest stand from the other side .
bg madam president , commissioner füle , welcome to the house .
i wish to thank mr swoboda , mr thaler and mrs oomen ruijten for their balanced , objective reports .
history must bring us together and not tear us apart .
they must not contain descriptions inciting a hostile attitude towards other member states .
these people are subjected to verbal and physical abuse and even legally persecuted for fabricated reasons .
in this case , mr posselt , the principle of pacta sunt servanda applies .
the process will never be linear .
however , the treaty of lisbon will also have brought about lasting changes to the european union .
when things are good in the neighbourhood , they are also good for the people who live there .
turkey and cyprus are neighbours .
un secretary general ban ki moon last week indicated a belief that a solution for cyprus is possibly within reach .
it is not just turkey that has to make an effort , however .
ultimately , that is , of course , what we all want a solution .
there is still a need to complete the programme of small scale privatisations and reduce state interference in the economy .
madam president , I welcome commissioner füle and I would like to congratulate the authors for three well balanced reports .
in this decade , enlargement policy has been the european union's greatest success , along with the euro .
given the time restrictions , I shall just make a few brief comments .
we are european citizens with european rights .
macedonia has fulfilled the conditions and has been waiting for negotiations to start since 200as mr swoboda said , many things cannot be resolved in the way that we imagine they will be .
my third point concerns the cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
croatia handed over all its wanted war criminals years ago .
the latter has made impressive progress despite manifold difficulties and should be encouraged to continue .
turkey , too , has made significant progress .
that is one of the comments that I would like to make .
turkey is adapting to the eu and this includes the area of privatisation .
therefore , we must put the focus on the social aspect of the eu .
i know we should not talk about the end of the new parliamentary term on the first day .
we also wish this for the countries we are talking about today .
this has to stop and this must be a strong message sent to ankara by the european parliament .
decisions must be taken on the performance of the applicant country .
we support the statement that mr lópez garrido gave us this morning .
these minorities are suffering from constant violations of their rights .
mr lópez garrido , I have a personal comment ideology and human rights do not mix .
the united kingdom is full .
we certainly need a discussion in our country about whether we should be in the european parliament or not .
do we still consider the values , the shared european values , important ?
these values are based on the teachings of christianity , irrespective of the proportion of actively religious people .
unfortunately , it needs more than a minute .
i can assure you that greeks are neither nationalists nor expansionists .
serious academics in skopje do not support the nationalistic trends of their prime minister .
in fact , the report we are debating today is the last progress report produced by the european parliament .
fr madam president , a question , yes , but which question ?
i mentioned this just now in my speech .
candidate countries , like member states , must therefore show the utmost sensitivity in matters such as this .
we all agree , of course , that turkey has to comply with the additional protocol .
in any case , madam president , the presidency's position on negotiations with turkey is absolutely clear .
let me make two general observations .
first , I take the promises I made during the hearings very seriously .
thirdly , the process being honest and reflecting credibility on both sides and at all levels .
i know , however , that the turkish government is still committed to the democratic opening .
i am looking forward to a very fruitful and close cooperation over the next five years .
the vote will take place during today's vote .
this represents a major step forward .
croatia's accession to nato in april 2009 has definitely strengthened her claim for accession to the eu .
measures must be taken against corruption within the institutions .
at the moment , the country which is closest to acceding to the eu is croatia .

2009 progress report on the former yugoslav republic of macedonia 
explanations of vote
mr president , the greatest constraint on a government is external competition .
the good news is that the electorate does not like it .
it does not avoid taxation .
what it tries to do is avoid double taxation .
it is the main international donor .
we would have preferred her to hurry out there to do her job .
only rarely can earthquakes such as this be predicted .
how successful the aid and cash effort is will be assessed with reference to these criteria .
and what thanks did they get ?
we are about to mandate a bail out in plain violation of article 125 of the treaties .
i am also saying this on a special day for italians , because today is the day of remembrance .
all this has been possible partly due to the wait and see , over tolerant attitude of the west .
fi mr president , it is very obvious that the situation in iran has reached crisis point .
in any case , we must be clear and defend european values even in our relations with the iranians .
is it the case that we are appeasing our conscience by having formulated such a resolution ?
that must not be so we need concrete action .
we have taken a strong stance , however , and we have to proceed from that .
this making of excuses is irresponsible and indefensible .
we therefore need to make a commitment , and we cannot afford to wait any longer to do so .
mr president , I welcome the opportunity to support this resolution .
i believe that it is more important to focus our attention on saving resources .
we have to ask ourselves how we can make progress jointly with other states .
recently , there has been an increasing number of reports of climate scientists having faked data .
it is important for us to discuss this and make our opinions known .
however , I cannot understand the scaremongering that has been associated with the phraseclimate change.
the environment is altogether too important to be left to the left .
let us look at our own behaviour here in this european parliament .
i have been concerned about climate change throughout my 10year career as an mep .
glaciers are not melting everywhere .
in any event , contrary to what the ipcc announced , they are not melting in the himalayas .
water levels are not about to rise and cover bangladesh , quite the contrary .
white bears , which are said to be disappearing , have never been as prolific as they are today .
it is probably astronomic in origin and not caused by the alleged greenhouse gases .
we already opposed this difficult topic during the electoral campaign and included it in our manifesto .
how are we to explain this difference between the two unions ?
we have resisted plans for this parliament to have europe wide taxes .
although some considerations may be well intentioned , let us not forget that too much protection destroys all protection .
i am persuaded that how we view abortion is our own internal matter .
equal rights , equal opportunities and equality between the genders in everyday life is definitely in all our interests .
perhaps they have not read it .
we all think we understand what that means .
how is an employer supposed to judge that ?
is it a question of how hard it looks like someone is working ?
result explosion of elephant numbers .
we in this house do not think of the elephant in the way that the african does .
and yet , this principle has not been enshrined in the arbitration agreement .
cs I will be very brief again .
despite this , a majority of meps supported the start of accession talks some years ago .
written explanations of vote
it is with great conviction that I voted in favour of mr casa's report .
missing traders then fail to remit the vat to the national exchequer .
i welcome the application of the reverse charge vat system .
meanwhile , subject a does not pay vat , as he is not the end seller .
the only references which anyhow are already in the commission's proposal concern the roma population .
i welcome the amendment made by parliament , which supports territorial cohesion .
this is a global problem , and it affects thousands of families all over europe !
these are the reasons that led me to vote in favour of the following amendments .
therefore it makes no sense to limit the regulation to only the new eu 12 member states .
it will thus be possible to establish an integrated and sustainable approach at eu level .
this report gives the eu concrete means for helping its citizens .
this would make it easier for the member states to legally implement the cofinancing for rural home renovation .
the objective of the proposal is to provide acceptable housing conditions within the framework of an integrated approach .
i believe that the compromise agreed today will be a useful tool in combating fraud and evasion .
this inconsistency cannot even be justified in the name of efficiency .
the automatic exchange of all data on every non resident in europe will lead to an unmanageable flood of data .
the precedent in the field of taxation of savings should set alarm bells ringing .
the aim of the directive is to improve administrative cooperation in the field of taxation .
it is hard for the member states to assess the amount of taxes and duties correctly .
with this in mind , I voted for the proposal on mutual assistance in this area .
national provisions relating to recovery only apply within the territory of each member state .
that is why I voted in favour of this resolution .
i had the pleasure and honour of contributing to the drafting of this resolution by parliament .
on the other hand , as after the asian tsunami , we need to draw lessons from what happened .
haiti and its people need fire fighters , doctors , hospitals and basic necessities .
unfortunately , too much time was wasted on protection , and not everything has gone smoothly .
after emergency aid , our focus should gradually turn to the long term development of haiti .
while the sympathies of europeans are with the relatives of the victims , there is a need to act .
the largescale and prompt commitments in the form of assistance from the eu are obviously vital .
there is no aggregate consciousness that would suffer more distress than a single one .
the distress of the masses is always the distress of the single person .
i think that the eu needs to promote better coordination and a higher profile in supporting the haitian state .
in the event of a natural disaster , humanitarian aid needs to arrive without delay .
this leads us to condemn the policies pursued by the iranian regime .
there are many countries where democracy and human rights are in a precarious position .
the eu must continue its attempts to change this situation by means of appeals and similar methods .
we should not be surprised by the actions of iran and its attempts to become a nuclear power .
i am glad the eu is taking a very clear position on this matter .
for these reasons , I have abstained .
in writing . the ecr supported a strong resolution on iran .
it should also be clarified that fortunately there are noeu embassiesin tehran .
there are national embassies .
the islamic republic of iran is unstinting in condemning poor treatment of muslims throughout the world .
the european parliament will have a crucial role to play in combating trafficking in human beings .
i voted for this resolution because the european union must combat illegal immigration and human trafficking .
such a situation can be exploited by criminal gangs .
all member states must take severe measures to fight against human trafficking , ensuring the coordination of national legislation .
i therefore urge the european commission to take strict and robust measures to combat trafficking in people .
you are irresponsible !
it is horrifying how common this terrible phenomenon is .
human trafficking is a negation of liberty , dignity and equality .
those who call it a modern form of slavery cannot be accused of exaggeration .
it is an activity which is exceptionally profitable , and is controlled by dangerous , organised criminal gangs .
the detection rate for this type of crime is very low .
therefore , I endorse the resolution of the european parliament on preventing trafficking in human beings .
giving incidental , individual items of information about cases of human trafficking which have been uncovered is not sufficient .
references to the treaty of lisbon strengthening eu action in criminal matters ,
in writing . ukip believes that environmental protection is important .
we cannot repeat the same errors that occurred in copenhagen .
what we need is another economic and social model that opposes capitalism .
these last two stipulations are missing from the resolution , and I therefore voted against its adoption .
this problem , which is a matter of concern all over the world , needs a fast solution .
the eu must be capable of taking a leading role in the fight against climate change .
i therefore believe we need to propose a new economic and social model to challenge capitalism .
the copenhagen climate summit was rightly considered by most observers to be a failure .
in my opinion , we are still at a stage when making binding and final decisions is inadvisable .
parliament reiterates its aim of increasing this reduction to 30 % .
i have voted against the resolution .
apart from any environmental romanticism , we must not forget european industry .
there is a need for continued detailed debate on the various issues it raises .
it requires transparency , exchange of information , cross border cooperation and fair tax competition .
we will not be used as a moral alibi for such a policy .
there are much more efficient ways of combating the issue of double taxation .
such statements must , however , be followed by the conclusion of legally binding agreements .
every member state must ensure that workers of both genders receive equal pay for work of equal value .
the victims of human trafficking are mostly women .
also , the adoption of this resolution integrates two dimensions , which I consider to be fundamental .
it also promotes a much wider awareness of sexual health matters for both women and men .
this is primarily a statement of principles which I am comfortable in supporting .
it is consistent with the principles espoused by labour and social democratic parties across europe .
equality between women and men has long been a fundamental principle of the european union .
the report of marc tarabella clearly emphasises the greatest barrier to gender equality .
i do not even think that this should be difficult to achieve .
once again , parliament has acted as a mere sounding board for the most extreme agendas .
the report also emphasises that women must have access free of charge to consultation on abortion .
i remain firm in my commitment to promoting a responsible sexual culture .
thanks to the crisis , the number of insecure jobs and compulsory part time positions are increasing .
that is why I voted in favour of the measures relating to the protection of these rights .
this charter is legally binding and enables women to be protected in the same way as men .
women should have control over their sexual and reproductive rights .
it divides rather than unites men and women .
thus , parliament is aiming to destroy the natural family as a place of socialisation and solidarity between generations .
this resolution does not offer any added value to women or to men or to the union .
human activities are adding to this rate of extinction and are endangering biodiversity .
the european parliament is calling for a total ban on the marketing of bluefin tuna internationally .
we must be ambitious and demand the protection of all species that are at risk of extinction .
it aims to prevent the excessive exploitation of these species for international trade .
we must be fair there is a vast difference between industrial fishing and traditional fishing techniques .
all the member states are party to it .
within the eu , national legislation varies from one member state to another .
the report adopted by the european parliament plenary includes amendments which I have tabled .
it is a rocky road and is fraught with difficulties we portuguese know that only too well .
i know that croatia can live up to its aspirations .
for our part , croatia can count on our complete support .
it is not croatia that I am opposing by voting against this progress report .
the implementation of the community acquis is , of course , an essential requirement in this respect .
this is very important for stabilisation in the region .
there is no need to hurry and there is no time pressure that justifies this process .
the resolution on croatia is a political resolution with no legal binding force .
there is therefore no reason to suspect that croatia is a nation hostile to the lgbt minority .
some of these are of a material nature , while others are more historical or political .
the eu introduced a visa free regime with this state .
this in particular fosters the development of people to people contacts .
it is our partner in nato and deserves to be treated as such .
for its part , turkey must commit further to the reform process that is under way .
the people of turkey do not deserve to be ostracised in any way .
there are other basic issues .
turkey has an islamic identity that is very different from the judaeo christian identity of most eu countries .
very significant progress has been made in terms of complying with the standards of a market economy .
it is also a territory which could provide routes for the transfer of energy sources to europe .
turkey must understand that it cannot change its past .
as you know , the european parliament has been very active in this matter .
our parliament is composed of members directly elected by the citizens of europe .
we are fully aware of this .
therefore , finding the right middle ground , here , was important .
the measures we have taken will also be helped by our discussion today .
data exchange without an agreement has worked uninterruptedly for many years .
the decision that was taken is well known .
that was the decision taken .
it is very important to us .
the report also highlights that tftp is a valuable source of reliable information necessary in the fight against terrorism .
that means that the data held on the tftp database are effectively anonymous .
this is important .
i can assure you that only a fraction of swift data will be transferred under the interim agreement .
finally , the interim agreement is only an interim agreement .
thank you , mrs malmström , for your explanations .
we wanted it to be a strong signal .
we are directly elected members of the european parliament .
our responsibility to defend citizensrights is of fundamental significance and we always stress this .
our response to the text for the negotiations is to make two very clear points .
it also became clear that it was only after this that things started to move .
the serious problems regarding data protection have already been referred to .
who is storing it ?
all of these factors represent serious failings in this agreement .
if you can do this , we will support the new agreement .
the objective of a new round of negotiations must be to find a compromise between these two things .
this is about european citizens being entitled to a proper democratic and transparent procedure .
so , if the council wants the consent of this house , it will have to meet our demands .
we have told the citizens of europe in the course of the public discussion that we would do so .
we have big brother's little sister waiting for our approval .
we find ourselves in a situation in which parliament must stand up for its beliefs and make a decision .
mt let me make it clear that the european popular party is in favour of this agreement .
this means that a new agreement will have to be drawn up that will provide better guarantees regarding security .
this is an issue about whether a badly drafted agreement serves the interests of security and anti terrorism .
es mr president , I reject the methods and the time used for this agreement .
i trust the government of the united states and the great democracy by which it is established .
an interinstitutional agreement is urgently needed .
but you could not do even this today .
the bulk transfer of data , the commissioner said , is not a problem .
only some data will go there .
where are they ?
these attempts to threaten us can be described in one word ridiculous .
therefore , I believe that we should aim for a postponement and then ultimately ..
the president cut off the speaker 
if terrorists can hide among ordinary people , security is reduced .
what do they cost and what is their collective effect on privacy and liberty ?
show us how effective these measures are using open documents , not secret ones .
i would like to raise two matters .
unexpectedly , they have listened to this institution , something which I hope will be repeated in the future .
we should pick up on this and take the opportunity to improve the agreement .
we have already been promised before this agreement that this time things would be quite different .
our backs are not against the wall .
we certainly hope that the final agreement will be properly negotiated .
i would like to make three comments regarding the issue itself .
the agreement under debate today is probably not perfect .
the council is making a commitment to do this .
we cannot ignore the fact that this agreement has come in for a great deal of criticism .
member of the commission . mr president , this has been an extremely important debate .
some of them are answered in the bruguière report , so I would really encourage you to read that .
we must take a decision tomorrow .
even more importantly , I have asked for time to consult with the united states .
thank you very much for making this possible .
mr rubalcaba , you have put your finger on it .
i think it is very unfair to use that as a form of argument .
the netherlands and belgium cannot end up being thedupeof all this .
the threat of terrorism is not getting smaller .
we should make every effort to ensure that the final agreement guarantees the necessary protection of personal data .
body scanners operation of intelligence services in the context of counter terrorism strategies debate 
firstly , detroit highlights the fact that terrorists continue to target civil aviation as a priority .
secondly , detroit highlights the importance of collecting data , but also of integrating and analysing it .
this brings us to the debate on information management .
these considerations must be taken into account in our next debate .
my priority as transport commissioner is definitely the safety and security of passengers .
as the minister just said , terrorists develop .
we must develop as well , and body scanners are only one element in this variety .
i look forward to bringing this evaluation to you and to discussing it with you .
there can be no freedom without security and there can be no security without freedom .
we will also have to revise how we use our financial resources .
you gave us a very hopeful prospect .
looking back , we have to say that terrorism is a real threat to the people of europe .
now we must look to the future .
what will we be faced with over the next few years ?
the first concerns cooperation among the authorities in europe .
every document comes with a headline emphasising the importance of collaborating and strengthening our cooperation .
once again nothing happened in toledo with regard to practical cooperation .
that is where the problem lies .
we need more security in this area .
they are already in place in the us , in the netherlands and in other countries .
just a few green or red dots or the whole person who is being scanned ?
there are a lot of questions to be answered and we are in the process of doing this .
we need to search for the bombers and not the bombs .
these specifications covered privacy , data protection , human dignity , health and freedom of choice .
if such spots are seen , the passengers in question are checked separately on the spot .
no surprise there .
european citizens also need to know that we in parliament have a responsibility .
can there be any greater mockery of human rights ?
mr president , you said that there were three commissioners who are responsible here .
we are very happy about this .
that is exactly the kind of statement we should be making at this early stage .
i have been stopped many times at airports .
he owes me and , more importantly , the british and european public , an apology .
i fundamentally object to that policy .
we cannot wait any longer because the terrorists are not waiting .
however , there are also three institutional elements .
the first is cosi , the standing committee on internal security .
fr mr president , one of the means of preventing terrorism is information .
a parliamentary supervisory body on the matter is urgently required .
it seems that no one is willing to deal with the subject .
i have even heard in this chamber today that terrorism is hysteria .
what utter nonsense !
in terms of security , do these scanners make it possible today to really guarantee security conditions ?
some governments have legitimately started to test body scanners on more sensitive routes .
i shall call the speakers in the order that I have 
mr matula
and mr mölzer .
the president cut off the speaker 
it is no longer possible for individual member states to do what they want .
this applies in particular to body scanners .
the president cut off the speaker 
the only aim of terrorism is death .
we need to ask ourselves two questions .
i would like to see this assessment completed before we do anything else .
i would have to do so at least twice a week .
therefore , I am calling for clear answers and not for hasty reactions .
indeed , we should be aware that frequent exposure to low doses of radiation can cause cancers and malformations .
my question therefore concerns justification of the risks .
the president cut off the speaker 
despite this , the usefulness of the various anti terrorism measures has never been called into question .
mr president , I have listened carefully to the speeches by all the groups and members on this topic .
we have heard some extremely interesting views , and I welcome them .
europe has a strategy for its counter terrorism policy .
we have an important figure , a counter terrorism coordinator , whose speeches are very interesting .
we are also keen to ensure the correct exchange of information .
that is the information that needs to be transmitted .
there have been significant improvements recently in the european union in that regard .
ideally , we will be able to decide on a common solution at european level .
once the reports are available , we will adopt a common position , which I believe is necessary .
mr president , I asked a direct question to the council and I would like an answer .
so this is what we will do in the near future .
we will come with a report and then we will continue this discussion .
member of the commission . mr president , this is indeed an extremely important debate .
counter terrorism is an important tool for fighting terrorism .
terrorism remains a high level threat in the european union .
therefore , this is the issue which has to be addressed .
therefore , once we have evaluated the existing situation , we must continue our work in this sensitive area .
body scanners may be one of the ways of strengthening security in airports and on board aeroplanes .
i await with great interest the study that the european commission will submit on this matter in march .
safety is a key issue in our lives it is the most important issue .
in writing . we cannot wait for another catastrophe before acting to protect air passengers .
i eagerly await the conclusion of the commission report of the impact of body scanners .
the terrorist threat has made us agree more readily to the restriction of our own freedom .
i totally agree with finding viable solutions for enhancing our citizenssecurity .
to fight terrorism effectively , we need coordinated action , including eu rules on scanners .
there is no point talking about it at all if the scans are to be voluntary .
the research should be coordinated by the european commission with the full cooperation of member states .
the scanners used must have a safety certificate allowing their use in all member states .
alongside the current forms of security , full body scanners have been brought into use .
it is important because a democratic ukraine will serve as an important example to its neighbours .
the statement issued by the high representative on monday expressed this sentiment .
ukraine has consistently held good elections , and has a vibrant civil society and free media .
we expect to see concrete steps forward .
it is up to ukraine to choose the model it wants to adopt .
we have many tools to do so .
he is certainly responsible for the failure of the orange revolution .
we must give them perspectives .
the recent presidential elections can be seen as another step in the consolidation of democracy .
this is true , but ukraine remains a state even after these elections .
in recent times , the tempo has been slowing , and we must speed it up again .
gas is one subject which always causes a great deal of consternation .
i only need to mention sevastopol , where we are facing a major conflict .
we cannot simply let things go on as they have before .
you have taken on a significant responsibility in this area .
the close election result reflects the fact that the country is split into two camps .
it won , because it was all about having rules from which everyone could benefit .
however , this is good this is how it should be .
commissioner , be bold and be the first person who starts to say that there is room .
not today , not tomorrow , but there will be room .
everyone must feel that they have an opportunity .
someone must , at last , after these five years , say it .
in the meantime , we should encourage and do much more for integration at the grassroots level .
however , let us not push the new president of ukraine into the arms of moscow .
the question is whether the ukraine can consolidate democracy internally .
this means establishing democratic norms and protecting human rights .
many reforms were never implemented , and many never left the drawing board .
however , we should say something to the european union .
perhaps these presidential elections will help bring the country out of political stalemate and will provide more stability .
ukraine is a european country which must have the right to take decisions on europe .
sl commissioner , your report on ukraine today was very clear .
otherwise , the results of the next elections will already have been decided .
the eu must provide close support and assistance for this stabilisation process .
again , I apologise to all those to whom I could not give the opportunity to speak .
the vote will take place during the second part session in february .
ukraine is currently faced with two value systems .
another group of citizens look at european integration with distrust .
one of the most important areas of cooperation will be the issue of energy supply .
this regulation will require member states to approve coordinated action plans in the event of gas supply disruptions .
in writing . ukraine continues to be crucial for the stability and democratic development of europe .
election promises must be fulfilled .
question time council 
the next item is question time b7 0006 / 2010 .
the following questions are addressed to the council .
madam president , the internal energy market and security of energy supply are inextricably linked .
the member states concerned should also act as one on this matter .
the public consultation about the eu 2020 strategy on the commission website is over .
i can assure you , mr posselt , that religious freedom forms an integral part of those criteria .
i have two brief additional questions .
what constitutesnormal religious activities?
de thank you for your accurate answers , mr garrido .
however , I would like to ask for some even more detailed information .
a number of other trials are under way , notably in poland and the uk .
what measures will it propose to ensure that these circumstances are not repeated in the future ?
the question is this will we denounce the human rights violations that are inherent in all of this ?
in this respect , I believe that the role of the press is an absolutely vital one .
the sitting was suspended at 19.25 and resumed at 21.00 
in this case , eu industry needs to retarget its export markets and possibly the future of its products .
by and large , only a few countries resorted to trade protectionism .
external sources of growth will be crucial to eu economic recovery .
promoting a strong contribution to development goals is already an important part of the eu's trade policy .
it is a pleasure to see you here .
a year ago , I was extremely concerned .
however , no trade war came about .
i would say that it is too early to declare the crisis over .
the crisis has not passed .
it is , in any event , an expression of a mercantilism that I believe to be damaging .
that would amount to considered action and leadership on our part .
this has an extremely powerful effect on employment .
what commercial policy instruments does the european union have available to tackle the financial crisis and its repercussions ?
i am counting exclusively on this europe 2020 strategy to find these answers .
madam president , commissioner , thank you for having put the fantasy of crisis related protectionism into its proper context .
the problems begin when the economy slows down , market indices fall sharply and problems start with unemployment .
this can be seen clearly in the current situation .
but what does the commission do ?
last year , the uk economy contracted 4.8 % .
so did italy's .
however , this would incur a much higher social cost .
these countries are thus extremely sensitive to crises .
the eu can and must act as a beacon for the liberalisation of world trade .
protectionism is an evil and has always been an evil .
one of the international trade actors which have enacted additional and counterproductive trade barriers is russia .
as a consequence , a total of 30 % of the eu's product lines have seen increased tariffs .
in my country , there is a saying that attack is the best form of defence .
i look forward to hearing your answer , mr de gucht .
time is working against us , even more than before as a result of the crisis .
how does the us rate the importance of these relations ?
to my mind , this third way must be embodied by the creation of a fair trade framework .
i would like to propose looking at the differences between these two guiding principles in three areas .
is it good for the environment that goods are delivered from great distances ?
the president cut off the speaker 
we must fight against any protectionist tendencies .
we are also facing a new world order .
i would be very grateful if you could devote your attention to the tec .
also , within asia , the other asian countries are facing very fierce competition from china .
being a member state of the european union also implies some obligations .
this is the point at which we must start .
secondly , we need regulations for the companies that have suffered damage as a result of the crisis .
that is a very good thing .
however , the main protests are coming from the car industry .
these terms are reciprocity , european interest , the fight against dumping and the fight against tariff barriers .
this is the scenario in which our major businesses are forced to operate .
the president cut off the speaker 
free and fair trade forms the basis for europe's prosperity .
the level of duties that korea can refund under the duty drawback are gradually being reduced .
the negotiators are convinced that the economic relevance of the duty drawback will therefore diminish over time .
what evidence does the commission have to support this argument ?
commissioner , I look forward to working closely with you in the new agreement that is coming up .
after more than two years of negotiations , the free trade agreement was initialled on 15 october last year .
throughout the negotiating process , the commission remained in close contact with parliament .
the provisional application is decided by the council on a proposal by the commission .
it is of great importance that we apply the agreement as soon as is feasible .
the economic benefits of the fta are mostly in the eu's favour .
the commission has paid particular attention to creating a new market access opportunity in korea for european fruit and vegetables .
we find ourselves in economically tricky times , but we know that you are not afraid of them .
mr caspary also made this point .
and they are not , as one of my colleagues indicated , insignificant .
we called for non tariff barriers to be tackled and this will be of particular benefit to the automobile industry .
we wanted improved trade in environmental goods .
is this a perfect deal ?
well , of course it is not .
is it a good deal , potentially , for the world economy ?
every european citizen expects all of us , commission and parliament , to demonstrate political sensitivity .
mr president , as you said , this agreement breaks new ground .
just what do these figures mean , however ?
i am an elected representative for the west of france region , and more specifically for brittany .
we have heard them here tonight about the car industry .
so we must do all we can to break down the barriers that are in that particular region .
these complaints give rise to questions that continue to go unanswered .
what are the key elements of this programme ?
mr president , I do not see this in the same way as the previous speaker .
consequently , china is also the country's main trade competitor .
this free trade agreement will , as has been mentioned , remove tariffs worth eur 1.6 billion a year .
even the usa has shelved its fta with south korea partly because of similar objections from the car industry .
employees in the eu deserve better .
we expect answers from you today , commissioner .
the commission has drafted a regulation on the methods for implementing safeguard measures within the context of this agreement .
the proposals put forward provide for complicated procedures for invoking and enforcing the safeguard clauses .
they keep signalling to me to tell me that they cannot keep up with you .
also , the european trade unions federation has criticised this free trade agreement .
therefore , it is my conviction that we should act as follows .
i expect the commission to produce a very comprehensive analysis of the consequences of bringing this agreement into force .
my first question concerns the need for fair competition conditions .
i am not able to understand this fully .
this includes approving safeguard clauses and implementation as part of the codecision process .
if it was the other way round , we might have cause for concern .
this concerns mainly telecommunications , environment protection , transport , finance and legal services .
the president cut off the speaker 
so you should not be so worried about it and about ratification by parliament .
that implies , of course , that there will be a debate in your committee .
opel announced back at the beginning of 2009 that it intended to cut capacity in europe by 20 % .
the agreement with south korea was only concluded afterwards .
this may be related to policies that I was recently involved in in belgium .
the debate is closed .
the risks of infection following an accident are not insignificant .
this proposal never came , but stephen hughes and I did not give up the fight .
our healthcare workers cannot wait and should not continue to be placed in danger .
it is really time now to act decisively .
if this ambiguity is not clarified , then we risk seeing dramatic variability in the application of the directive .
needle stick injuries are the most common and most dangerous form of medical sharp injuries .
all of these things are necessary , not just one or two all of those things are necessary .
it is no coincidence that all are the same in this respect .
that is another area that we need to think about for the future .
i am aware that this is a long standing concern of this house .
it was indeed the commission's wish to have these points in the agreement .
such measures , which are also minimum requirements , are not only much welcomed but above all absolutely necessary .
this agreement therefore represents an important step towards an increase in safety within the hospital sector .
firstly , the importance of health and safety in the workplace .
what is the price paid for a lack of hygiene and safety in the workplace ?
secondly , the importance of prevention , as prevention is better than cure .
we do not want any more needle stick injuries unnecessarily during that waiting time .
i am not entirely sure whether that includes cleaning staff , and I would welcome some clarification on that .
an issue was raised about the cost .
we have here a real health issue , which we must regulate as quickly as possible .
my husband is a doctor and , a few years ago , he was infected by a needle .
the days spent waiting for the results were extremely difficult .
sometimes we say that europe needs to get closer to its citizens .
with this debate , we have certainly managed to do so .
i am sure we are all grateful to the initiators of this debate .
let us hope that things improve .
that cannot be right .
let me start with your first question .
this includes the need for the restrictions to be appropriate , coherent and systematic .
we must undertake a closer examination of the reasons why member states restrict online gambling services .
i find that to be a rather odd conclusion and do not believe it to be the case .
how can we best protect the interests of our citizens and consumers ?
how can we best prevent fraud and criminal activity ?
how can we best protect our citizens from harm ?
perhaps I should add that a consultation would be better than an infringement procedure .
this is not the open europe or the transparent europe that I want .
it is the europe which says ,do as I say , not as I do.
as we wait for that , the european court of justice's verdicts continue to roll out .
i have great faith in you , commissioner barnier .
for young people , in particular , it constitutes a real threat .
if anyone has a romantic notion of gambling , then I have to disappoint them .
essentially , it is a billion euro business that is all too often associated with criminal activities .
we are striving to ensure that communications between people are as open as possible .
that also implies open access to the internet for children and young people .
ladies and gentlemen , I ask you , what kind of nonsense is this ?
who creates the legislative framework , who creates the rules for such businesses ?
rather , they should be supporting those that elected them and to whom they are accountable .
effective controls are no longer possible without an agreement on common rules for all 27 member states .
we therefore asked the commission last year to propose a framework european regulation for online gambling .
da mr president , welcome to parliament mr barnier and good luck with your job .
here we have a good opportunity to demonstrate this in practice .
i would have liked to have heard a somewhat clearer answer , however .
that is what I would have liked to have a very clear answer on .
there is no responsible or immediate management present to ensure that the gambler is of age and acting legally .
gambling addiction leads to serious social problems , such as broken homes , money problems and crime .
therefore , member states should make every effort to combat gambling and the associated problems with maximum force .
member states should not be facilitating any markets that promote social misery .
el mr president , the question indirectly calls for new community legislation .
the situation has , of course , changed since the internet became the largest gambling den in the world .
internet gambling is , moreover , viewed as agrey areaof law .
one is called the diagnostic statistical severity index and the other , the canadian problem gambling severity index .
whether we like it or not , people enjoy gambling .
there are huge social issues involved where people who have an addiction go beyond what they should do .
the loneliness and the basic invisibility of gamblers characterise a generally unacceptable addiction .
good luck .
we have to look at these things together .
the member states and the various operators are all involved .
the old commission very often drafted too many green papers and white papers without any decisions being taken .
the court accepts that , as it explicitly expressed once again in its judgment last september .
i am not an advocate of online gambling .
i would say more that I am against this activity .
we must protect minors and those who are vulnerable .
we must also prevent addiction and avoid organised crime .
it is sufficient to mention the effects related to the development of addictions , organised crime and money laundering .
in my opinion , regulation should focus on consumer protection issues .
there are upsides and downsides .
it is a huge revenue earner for the member states and we have digressed into huge areas .
we need a common policy because gambling transgresses borders .
it goes right across the entire european union .
so we are talking about action and we are talking about the timetable .
in the fourteen years since 1996 the gambling market has grown dramatically .
the services directive , orbolkestein directive, which was discussed here , expressly excluded gambling .
our current legislation is based on physical borders , but we reached the age of virtual borders long ago .
addiction to gambling is a major problem right now .
one study has found that people start gambling as early as sl commissioner , I wish you every success with your new portfolio .
we all know it it is a kind of escapism for the modern man and woman .
if need be , they can be banned from playing .
however , banning young people from gambling will not get us anywhere .
of course , I have been in office for 48 hours .
it is this , therefore , that is going to change .
that question , ladies and gentlemen , is assuredly one of a new and meaningful kind of european coordination .
there are other serious issues that pose just as great a challenge to the public interest .
i think that it is impossible .
i have spoken of challenges and trials , madam president , and I shall finish with them .
applause 
applause 
we salute him .
we truly hope that it will be a success .
we heard the council and the commission yesterday .
by withholding our consent on the interim agreement the security of european citizens is not being compromised .
applause from the left 
member of the commission . mr president , the commission would support a postponement of the vote .
i am ready to come to you personally the same day to present the mandate .
the commission will then immediately launch negotiations with the us to try to conclude them as soon as possible .
we will , within those powers , keep the european parliament fully informed at all stages of the process .
the commissioner declined to do so . 
parliament rejected the request to refer back to committee the report 
the next item is the vote .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting see minutes
we protest against the death of two venezuelan students who protested against this shutting down of the free media .
let us not forget that the most perverse way of eliminating the media is to initiate self censorship .
democracy simply does not exist .
i will resume because there is no point in wasting time .
if you want to make fools of yourselves today , be my guest .
there will be plenty of you at voting time , make the most of it .
however , this is not the right place .
there are many flagrant cases of violations of human rights in latin america .
then let us talk about colombia and honduras .
however this is not today's debate .
this diagnosis is also true , today , for venezuela .
the european commission should take appropriate action .
much diplomatic skill and sensitivity is required for this task .
i doubt that they constitute a majority in this house .
i personally denounce human rights violations when it comes to freedom of the press .
these desperate attempts to censor information and expression remind me of mahmoud ahmadinejad's behaviour .
trying to limit this vehicle is not only unjust , it will also prove ineffective .
mr president , press freedom and free democratic government are the foundations of the eu .
his response to a tv station critical of his rule was simply to take it off the air .
i therefore believe that socialists should not defend him .
one of the victims of the recent demonstrations was actually a socialist student .
we are , certainly , seeing disturbing events in venezuela .
the closure of radio and television channels and the violent suppression of student demonstrations speak of a totalitarian regime .
accused people must also be given the chance to defend themselves and appeal against their convictions .
we are talking about rights , plurality and freedom .
in this regard , the eu has noted with concern the continued suspension of media , including rctv international .
the september elections are widely seen as a milestone for the future of the country .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
written statements rule 149 
we must not forget this .
the maputo agreement foresees the establishment of a national unity government with a transition period of 15 months .
the situation is therefore tragic , catastrophic , for a population living on less than a dollar a day .
human rights violations are increasing .
that is as it should be , because this topic is very important .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
it awakens hope for the introduction of change and for democratisation .
neighbouring countries ?
tens of thousands of people have been displaced against their will .
like mrs de keyser , I think that their sole purpose is to legitimise the government in place .
we are once again going to ask the chinese , indian and russian governments to exert their influence .
within this context , it is impossible to contemplate free , fair and democratic elections .
in this regard , I must make an explicit appeal to the commission .
the reduction in funds which are destined for this area and for these refugees is of great concern .
we are talking about hundreds of thousands of people who require our help .
hence , I believe that it would be a good idea to avoid cutting these budgets .
the opposition parties are rightly going to boycott them .
many have fled to neighbouring bangladesh and have been brutally persecuted en route .
last year , karen refugees fleeing the repressions took refuge in thailand .
the list of human rights violations is endless and the situation does not appear to be improving .
corruption brings poverty and impunity .
hu the military junta has promised free , democratic elections for 20this may put an end to the recurring ethnic conflicts .
in fact , eu delegations and parliament's self righteous resolutions will also not achieve anything .
ro someone was saying earlier that we have already discussed burma in this house .
the current trend is to arrest people for expressing political views .
in addition , the eu has strongly supported the united nations efforts .
now the military government has promised elections in 2010 as a step towards its gradual exit from power .
by saying this , I make it very clear that the eu does not want to isolate burma .
we are , in fact , the biggest donors of humanitarian and related assistance to that country .
we have to remain committed ourselves .
the debate is closed .

eu 2020 follow up of the informal european council of 11 february 2010 debate 
so what has changed ?
greater continuity is fundamental to building relationships and carrying out a serious task .
some commentators have seen a great deal more in this role others have seen less .
where do we want to be in 10 or 20 yearstime ?
as I said , I cannot report any formal conclusions to you from an informal meeting .
applause 
hoping for a return of the good old days is no option .
one option is limited change the lowest common denominator which brings some reform and some growth .
but we could never get back what we lost in the crisis .
on the contrary .
this requires a joint effort .
it will centre on three priorities smart growth , inclusive growth , sustainable growth .
that means giving people jobs and skills and it means tackling the scourge of poverty head on .
it is also why we have been wise to reform financial markets .
we need strong and true coordination in the economic field .
by properly coordinating their budgets , the euro area states would acquire unprecedented influence and room for manoeuvre .
can we tolerate this any more ?
the crisis has gravely undermined europe's global competitiveness and weakened its political influence .
what answers can you give them ?
i would urge president van rompuy and president barroso to reconsider the nature of the so called exit strategy .
europeans deserve a more balanced and socially responsible policy approach .
the second point is that we also have to tackle the problem of the greek debt .
the problems with greece are proof of that .
applause 
be sure .
my colleague , mr giegold , will probably talk more about the eurobonds later .
i would just like to say one sentence about the eu 2020 strategy .
even before the recent crisis , the economies of europe were losing ground to our major rivals and competitors .
europe 2020 must not go the same way .
i am very pleased that my group was among the first to submit proposals to help with its progress .
we must recognise that governments do not create productive jobs or raise living standards .
only competitive business and successful entrepreneurs can do that .
we hope those states will liberalise .
this has so far resulted in more debt for each individual country and catastrophic savings rates for citizens .
heckling 
i fear that it will primarily be those who are already finding it hard to make ends meet .
well , I am afraid what we got was you .
loud protests 
reactions 
but since you took over , we have seen greece reduced to nothing more than a protectorate .
mr chair , will you take a blue card question ?
mr farage , are you willing to apply article 9 of the treaty to ask to simply leave europe ?
applause 
we must keep order and all the regulations of our parliament .
however , let us not get too worked up about that .
it is also that same eurocrat obstinacy which is now ramming turkey's accession strategy down our throats .
the 2020 strategy must be built on such a foundation .
our task now is to produce a new lisbon strategy , in other words , eu 20however , we need resources if this is to succeed .
we have had enough of that here today in parliament .
the method of open coordination has turned into a closed collusion and open humiliation .
however , we will not achieve these results without two absolutely vital ingredients .
i wonder where the group of the european people's party christian democrats stands on that .
following sme friendly procurement policies and allowing smes to participate in public / private partnerships will be a start .
an eu 2020 strategy focused on innovation in areas of existing expertise .
on the one hand , we have the european central bank for harmonising financial supervision and on .
remainder of speech not available for technical reasons 
moreover , the commission was not courageous enough , mr barroso .
that is the task that this strategy must allow us to fulfil .
firstly , that of knowing how we organise ourselves politically .
to achieve goals in public policy , a budget is needed .
it depends on two elements .
then you would have been able to do everything that you are proposing to us today .
they have both feet on the brakes .
that is what we need to see for the europe 2020 agenda .
the alternative is that dramatic .
the european union should not , as a general rule , employ despotism .
instead , it must guarantee the prosperity of the citizens of europe .
es beginning of speech not available for technical reasons .
it should not be the goal of a strategy .
you said very clearly that the market is not enough .
yes indeed , we want a social market economy .
european economic governance has been called for in many different ways by parliament .
such proposals have been put forward in parliament .
the member states and governments and the peoples .
do not fear the peoples and their representatives .
love them and they will love you back .
firstly , do we already have a europe 2020 strategy that promises success ?
i have one institutional and one substantive comment .
as for the substantive comment , the most important goal must be job creation .
through cohesion , the eu's competitiveness will grow as well .
that is what will lend credibility to the whole thing .
greece is not asking for money .
we all know that , through greece , speculators are targeting the euro area and the euro .
applause 
these issues have been very well presented here .
moreover , our country has never asked for financial support .
the commission will closely work together with greece and monitor how it implements the recommendations .
we have drawn consequences and learnt lessons from the crisis of the 1930s .
that did not happen during the 1930s .
why do we have this positive growth now ?
because we have taken measures .
therefore , we have protected our internal market , which is not perfect .
however , we have not lapsed back into the protectionism of the 1930s .
there are also some very positive things that have been produced .
i think that we have conducted and we are continuing to conduct a wise policy .
that means that some budgetary choices will need to be made .
this is where it gets difficult .
i have made quite a few proposals , which I believe are more intelligent than binding measures .
take a close look at article 121 so that you are fully aware of this .
one final word about greece .
if necessary , there is , of course , an element of solidarity .
naturally , we must draw conclusions from what has happened in greece in recent years .
we must learn lessons from every crisis .
thank you very much , mr president .
it was indeed a great pleasure to have you here with us for your maiden appearance in plenary .
it is actually the economic model which needs to change .
we cannot have a dynamic economy unless we have motivated workers .
exiting from the crisis is basically not a problem about economic or fiscal policy .
explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with rule 170 of the rules of procedure 
europe 2020 must not repeat the failures of its predecessor , the lisbon strategy .
at the same time , we must make up for our neglect .
we need a new approach to these new challenges .
the eu 2020 strategy must mark a breakthrough .
eu 2020 must clearly mark the start of the post lisbon phase .
the second is an education system which prepares the workforce based on the demands of the market .
the presidency is therefore going to have an active presence in the work of the council .
the eu would also actively participate in a panel on the rights of persons with disabilities .
the hardest test on human rights for any nation is when we stand accused of human rights abuse .
this cannot go on we also have to investigate these matters inasmuch as they affect us .
clearly , therefore , this body has little substantive moral authority .
secondly , this resolution makes reference to the cia and extraordinary rendition .
however , it should take a critical look at itself .
therefore , my electorate awaits self determination , along with the kashmiris .
welcome
it is outrageous and despicable that this parliament should take this terrible council seriously .
this mechanism is vital so that the human rights council can fulfil its mandate in whatever way possible .
i would like to refer to two other parliamentary priorities .
contrary to expectations , the human rights situation has not improved , but is worsening .
i would like today to stress mr milinkevich's message .
on the other hand , israel respects the rights of prisoners .
the iranian regime asserted that respect for human rights is guaranteed there .
in particular , they seek to make any opposition to immigration a criminal offence .
book burning is alive and well .
the commission calls upon cuba to change its policy and to live up to its obligations under international law .
i have many reservations about the unhcr's overall credibility .
this investigation should be in accordance with international standards .
a population was thrown into panic , trapped and unable to escape .
however , there has been the goldstone report .
we should not let it pass .
it is quite unacceptable that the council still has not endorsed the recommendations of the goldstone report .
i stress that this report is completely unbalanced .
it attempts , in fact , to absolve the terrorist activity of hamas .
every country has the right to defend itself against terrorists .
we have an obligation to exert pressure to achieve a fair solution and peace .
when have we ever seen hamas investigate its own actions ?
you only need to visit the middle east !
israel was exercising its right of self defence .
so let us not try to rubbish this report .
let us act on it .
the us congress called the goldstone report irremediably biased and unworthy of further consideration or legitimacy .
clearly , the 2008 war and the inhumane policy towards civilians are intended to be forgotten .
europe must not continue to look away .
this certainly holds true for the conflict in the middle east .
this is why the report has simply been ignored .
cs it is always deceptive to compare numbers which conceal the fate of individual human beings .
how can a state defend its citizens in such a situation ?
what did the international community do to prevent this form of terrorism ?
the truth is that violence remains a disastrous policy .
i also ask myself why the european union is not standing up for international law .
why does it allow impunity to reign in this region ?
any credibility in our respect for international law will be lost if the eu leaves these war crimes unchallenged .
this report is about major human rights violations .
there is therefore no conceivable argument why the recommendations of this report should not be implemented .
the israeli government has rightly taken the initiative in this regard and has launched a criminal investigation .
this is scandalous !
it found evidence of wilful torture , inhumane treatment and wilful causing of great human suffering .
that is the first step we should be taking .
while it makes far reaching demands of israel , it says little about hamas .
el mr president , the goldstone report hits the nail on the head .
there are witnesses to this .
we are letting the perpetrator go unpunished and are playing fast and loose with the victim .
over 1 400 victims in the gaza strip are obviously too many .
the question of the extent to which hamas used civilians as shields has not been adequately investigated .
it is also going to be debated in the human rights council .
we in the commission are very keen that two issues should always be high on our agenda .
civilians were attacked indiscriminately and houses were bombed .
the accusations are so serious that it is imperative that they be investigated , and quickly .
justice goldstone did not show sufficient care when examining the evidence .
reliance on the report of justice goldstone alone will not contribute to this .
mr president , my thanks to the spanish presidency and to the commission for their words on this situation .
it is included in the eastern partnership .
we have seen that mr yanukovich has been elected in ukraine .
we have not been open enough to the idea of genuine access to these countries .
let us look at our energy policy and let us attune it more to countries like belarus and ukraine .
if lukashenko does not understand the language of european values , he will certainly understand the language of sanctions .
this issue cannot be considered a polish belarusian internal affair .
it could have happened to any other minority .
therefore , it started with us .
i have had the opportunity to speak to mr milinkevich and mrs borys twice , now .
we , too , should proceed like this .
therefore , I would like to say one more thing .
tomorrow , the first official european parliament delegation in many years leaves for belarus .
harassment of national minorities is part of the political practice in undemocratic regimes .
i suspect that mrs georgieva's statement would have been the same two weeks ago , before these events .
this is certainly not acceptable .
what commissioner georgieva said to us aboutpeople to people contactsis important .
the commission's services have prepared a draft of this joint interim plan for reforms .
let me make my fourth and last point .
this is why frequent meetings between representatives of civil society and the government must be encouraged .
it is in his interests to polarise and divide public opinion in poland and europe .
i would like to thank our colleagues on the committee very much for their good cooperation .
the platform for action adopted was the first global document of its type .
the 15th anniversary of the beijing platform for action .
the swedish presidency has taken stock of what has been done in the eu with regard to equality .
we therefore have no other choice in the matter .
we will do it together .
we are on our way , with the goal firmly in view .
there is an old german saying many roads lead to rome .
we are still far from beijing's strategic objectives .
here in europe we still have a lot to address .
poverty is the greatest single determinant of health .
what we really need to do is empower women .
the commissioner rightly said that we need to get women out of the recession and back working .
this represented a significant step forward towards bringing about equal opportunities .
access to these rights is a particular problem , since legal redress is often extremely expensive and complicated .
you have given us positive messages and confirmed your willingness to act .
one of the tasks of the european institute for gender equality is to handle comparable data .
mr president , I thank colleagues for their contributions to this debate .
i think we need to look at these issues if we are to have genuine gender equality .
i think the spanish presidency is very concerned , for example , about the role of women in agriculture .
women's rights campaigners from islamic countries approach us , hoping that something will be done about it here .
the answer is , quite simply , because equality is not implemented in many areas .
it is nice to dream , practice is there , and we have to take things in hand .
i would therefore like to take this opportunity to congratulate it on this initiative .
one form of discrimination is violation of the reproductive rights of women .
in poland , it is this is an objective measure of the violation of women's reproductive rights in poland .
is it not time to tackle other obstacles as well ?
a significant problem in this situation is the lack of appropriate solutions concerning retirement pension entitlements for these women .
one minute speeches on matters of political importance
it is my belief that the european union will welcome this major agreement .
lithuania is a member of the european union .
court enforcement officers are being sent to enforce this order .
polish names are being lithuanianised .
the future of the union is currently in the balance .
es mr president , I would like to report something to parliament and ask for its support .
ro last week , I attended the meeting of the european union moldova parliamentary cooperation committee .
the republic of moldova shares the european union's values .
it might seem that if a state does belong to the european union it should observe all european standards .
there are significant problems over the operation of education with polish as the medium of instruction .
it is time for an elementary and civilised response .
this would be a clear gesture of support to those incomparably brave chinese democracy activists .
we must put an end to the massacre of stray dogs in romania .
anyone who does not love animals does not love people either .
i would urge the commission not to ignore this important area .
consequently , the agreement has been suspended , and no data is being transferred .
this constraint is particularly harsh in times of crisis such as the period we are experiencing at present .
monthly data on the level of unemployment in the union is increasingly depressing .
there are currently over 23 million people in europe who are without work .
i ask you .
all of those members had spoken in the previous sitting .
this is what happens .
i will inform you right now .
mrs paliadeli , you are on the list of speakers from the socialist group .
mr president , on what grounds ?
i have explained the criteria .
what else do you want to know ?
the one minute speeches come in , we get allocated time but it is pathetic .
thank you .
i should remind you that mr barroso is the president of the commission , not of the european parliament .
every one of us comes here to voice the demands of our electorate .
i understand your frustration .
written statements rule 149 
however , this process needs to be reciprocal .
on 6 and 7 march , mr hahn will visit madeira in order to see the damage first hand .
it is feared that the number of victims could increase .
the economic and social impact of this catastrophe is preventing people from returning to a normal way of life .
we also need to send a message of solidarity , hope and confidence to the people affected .
that is why we must fight for planning and development policies which are directed at the public good .
de mr president , this is certainly not a nice reason for this debate .
we also need to look to the future .
tragedies are not fair almost always , those who have the least are those who lose the most .
i am sure it will be treated with the utmost expediency by all concerned .
disasters definitely have no national borders .
i also call for immediate support for the victims in madeira .
as someone who lives in a mountainous region , I understand very well what happened here .
where they provide some leeway , the commission will use that for the benefit of madeira .
that is the order in which things need to be done .
it is currently still with the council .
rapporteur . madam president , I fully appreciate your presence in the plenary this evening .
the aim in the end is to ensure secure and cheap energy for both our citizens and our companies .
i have also noticed the temptation in this house to include everything in this regulation .
we also need some certainty about future investments to ensure proper and solid policy making .
i am stopping here .
this is intended to help to improve transparency for all market operators .
how we go about this needs to be dealt with in the context of specific energy policy initiatives .
this data needs to be aggregated at national and regional level .
more effective , in particular , if it took into account all the decentralised energy sources .
it will involve eu bodies in the area of competitive relationships between companies that are mostly privately owned .
the second layer concerns the level of confidentiality and the ensuing obligations of the commission to maintain secrecy .
and I am worried about duplication in that area .
i learned recently there were 45 different groups doing research into salmonella bacteria .
solidarity between member states must be translated from an idea into reality .
increasing investment in it systems for monitoring and reporting on fuel stocks during a crisis is also important .
the vote will take place on thursday , 25 february 20written statements rule 149 
the report enriches the contents in a meaningful and up to date way , and does so for two reasons .
the principle of solidarity must provide the platform for devising the european union's energy policies .
this regulation will provide the european commission with information about energy structures so that it can obtain an overview .
at the same time , coordination between future investments leaves a lot to be desired .
in hungary , for instance , this form of heating supplies some 2 million people .
district heating investments cannot be left out of consideration during harmonisation of energy investment policies .
if europe is to confront these problems , it must have effective and complex instruments at its disposal .
we would also point out that we have reduced the buildings reserve by eur 4 million .
however , this has given rise to debate concerning the 20 % rule .
in this context , I would also like to mention the slogan of legislative excellence .
myyesto the amendment to the parliamentary budget is conditional .
however , as parliamentarians , we are also obliged to conduct our legislative work in the best way possible .
this dual requirement must be met .
however , there are a number of questions on the timing and the funding of these proposals .
colleagues have raised some of those issues .
i think we should have been given that information as well .
this is going to be a difficult decision for members tomorrow .
the aim is to assess whether resources are being used in the best possible way .
my thanks also to our technicians and interpreters for eventually getting us through the evening .
this budgetary amendment provides a response to a real need .
closure of the sitting see minutes
he died after a long hunger strike .
because the common fisheries policy is one of the flagship policies of the european union .
i could not agree more that we need radical reform to turn around the structural failings of our policy .
as you all know , the last reform in 2002 was not sufficiently successful .
the public consultation has shown clearly that there is broad support for this reform .
i am very thankful for your constructive input .
together with the spanish presidency , a broad conference of cfp reform will be held in may .
i am sorry that you cannot attend this workshop .
today , however , the european parliament finds itself in a different position .
we need to ensure widespread introduction of environmental criteria and differentiate between coastal fishing and deep sea fishing .
we need to reduce the overcapacity of certain fleets .
we must bring them to the forefront and make an extra effort for them .
our common fisheries policy needs to be reformed .
i certainly do not .
i am very happy to see how far the reform has progressed .
a similar logic is in evidence in the baltic sea .
we believe that all types of harmful subsidies must be stopped .
this is to give an equal chance to all fishermen in all countries of the european union .
the european conservatives and reformists endorse the report , in the hope that the current system will change .
protecting the sustainability of resources requires other measures , such as guaranteeing a fair return within the sector .
the reality of fisheries in the eu is complex and diverse .
this is very different from the mere decentralised implementation of a centrally defined policy .
i thought the whole point of quotas was to prevent diminishing stocks .
it just goes to show where the commission's interests lie .
regretfully , we are not living in this ideal world .
and this was absolutely demonstrated by the debacle around the december fishing council and the decisions on quotas .
the market for these products will undoubtedly continue to grow but it seems that it will grow without us .
we have succeeded in incorporating important social democratic concerns into the report .
these include specific support for small scale fisheries .
we social democrats want to make it clear that one of the central problems is the outstanding overcapacity .
it is a fact that environmental sustainability is a fundamental prerequisite for the economic survival of fishermen .
finally , I would like to make one more fundamental point .
european fisheries policy is a hot potato , because it involves so many powerful national interests .
it will come as no surprise that these have led to heated debates within the groups in recent weeks .
we must leave the trivial problems of national greed to the council .
i am particularly concerned about fishermen operating inshore and from small coastal islands .
most importantly , there is no alternative source of employment for many of those people .
again , the commissioner has recognised this and I look forward to working with her .
the over centralised , inflexible cfp has failed miserably and we must accept that .
i have tabled amendments for which I seek support from colleagues .
no more micro management from the centre , no more top down regulation , no more one size fits all approach to policy .
it must involve the stakeholders in the day to day management of stocks .
we have to put sustainability and conservation at the heart of our agenda .
new technology must come to the rescue .
i commend this invention to the commission and indeed the whole world for consideration .
all of that seems to me to be both very relevant and very purposeful .
that is not a view I share .
mrs damanaki , we are counting on you .
el mr president , commissioner , mr martín fragueiro , the current common fisheries policy has failed .
eighty eight per cent of fish stocks are being fished beyond the maximum sustainable yield .
this long term approach to species conservation must also be applied in all our international fisheries agreements .
i support the drift of the commission's solution regionalisation .
in addition , compliance with the rules is poor at present .
the good are the victims of the bad .
this is remarkable .
we cannot talk in generalised terms about the overcapacity or the overfishing or the lack of compliance .
a regional , sector specific approach calls for nuanced language in this respect .
i shall turn my attention to three points firstly , overfishing .
chronic overfishing has resulted in smaller and smaller catches for european fisheries and lost jobs .
fish , man , cormorants and seals are competing systems in the same ecological environment .
we expect the commission .
cs I welcome the submission of the green paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy .
this is a fundamental problem , which should be solved by the introduction and monitoring of appropriate market mechanisms .
the green paper rightly evaluates current fisheries policy , highlighting its many imperfections .
however , the proposals do require further discussion .
i have always been rather fond of this organisation .
i think this gives credibility to the retailers who support the mse .
the issues are similar .
i like , in particular , the idea that we could fish less and earn more .
if we achieve that , we can perhaps do the same for agriculture .
the report also lays out a large number of principles and jointly agreed routes .
the reform must focus on responsible , sustainable and competitive fisheries .
it must accentuate the social dimension , give priority to the ecosystem and be integrated in the marine policy .
it is also essential to step up controls and put an end to unfair competition .
shellfishing activities must be completely integrated into the common fisheries policy .
da mr president , I think that the european common fisheries policy is important .
the president cut off the speaker 
pt I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and the azorean fishermen present here today .
the president cut off the speaker 
mr president , I , too , would like to begin by adding my congratulations to the rapporteur .
the common fisheries policy is a discredited policy and this reform gives us an opportunity for a fresh start .
it is important that the countries with small fishing industries are also represented .
however , we must not only discuss the environmental and economic aspects .
many families depend on these fisheries for their livelihoods .
we must take all of this into account .
and finally , the whole question of research has to be looked at .
having so many speeches is very encouraging .
i cannot answer all the points that were raised but I would like to underline some priorities .
second priority regionalisation .
in all honesty , we realise that it is impossible for a report to please everyone .
europe has always taken an interest in the fisheries sector .
we should , therefore , draw the right conclusions with regard to both institutional and practical solutions .
one of the fundamental mistakes of the 2002 reform was excessive centralisation .
the european commission must not treat the baltic sea on a par with the atlantic or the mediterranean sea .
excessive fishing quotas and illegal fishing are wiping out fish stocks at an alarming rate .
the eu must take the crisis in fish stocks seriously .
it is always difficult to find words of consolation for these sad occasions and silence is sometimes more telling .
it is the responsibility of the belgian investigation body to carry this out .
more than 20 different national systems are used in europe today to ensure the safe movement of trains .
the system is known as ertms european rail traffic management system .
the ertms specifications have been available since 2000 .
ertms was created primarily with a view to promoting interoperability .
overall data show that the belgian performance is average .
after accidents have occurred , new proposals are often made in a political context .
i must say that in this case , everything was in place , both the legislation and the technology .
firstly , we must not , under any circumstances , cut back on training in the rail industry .
of course , there are also associated budgetary consequences .
i would cite the example of directive 2004 / 49 / ec on safety on the community's railways .
that is a task I should like to entrust to you .
i hope you take another good look at this , commissioner .
indeed , there was a time when this would not have been so .
the investigation is under way , and we shall not speculate on its results .
it is , of course , evolving , and it will continue to evolve .
this is what it takes to preserve a very high level of technology .
such integration would make it possible , for example , for the equipment to be type approved .
the belgian railways sncb receive relatively the highest subsidy in the whole of the european union .
belgium gives 32 euro cents per passenger / kilometre to its railways .
despite all these subsidies , the sncb still has debts of eur 10 billion .
when I look at the infrastructure of the sncb , the neglect is striking .
let us dismiss straight away the idea that all accidents are , by nature , unforeseeable .
it greatly increases the likelihood of accidents .
without change .
the president cut off the speaker 
in 2001 , a train crash occurred in pécrot that was similar to last week's in buizingen .
i do not want to give any lectures from a german point of view in this situation .
who has benefited from them ?
the commission must therefore consider the role of public services in more general terms .
surely he cannot disregard the fact that the belgian railways sncb receive the highest subsidy in europe ?
if the politicised rail system ran the railways better , these things would not happen .
the investigations are under way they must be allowed to run their course .
the evaluation was only completed a short time ago .
well , it should be stipulated that safety certificates must be obtained before operating licences can be granted .
we shall , of course , await the investigations .
the consequence of this is the establishment of so many different systems and the emergence of safety problems .
it is then safety and competitiveness which suffer because of this .
there is no competition on the rail passenger transport market in belgium .
the question is why was it not installed ?
i was the rapporteur for the ertms .
that is a task for the individual countries .
this was not the first time that a train has passed a red signal .
however , safety still remains the responsibility of member states , whatever system is used .
by 2020 , 20 000 kilometres of railways will use this system in europe , including belgium .
that will be very important .
there is always some small possibility for human error .
the safety of the rolling stock must be improved , as well as the safety of the signalling systems .
against this background , I am calling for higher safety standards on the railways .
others are still in service when common sense suggests that they should not be .
delays are becoming the norm , including in the case of tgv services .
mr batten , the previous statement was a statement made in reply to something said yesterday in parliament .
situation in ukraine 
mr president , this is only a factual correction .
parliament's priorities for the un human rights council geneva , 1 26 march 2010 
in this house yesterday , commissioner georgieva strongly and forcefully condemned this event .
beijing + 15 un platform for action for gender equality
τhe next item is the vote .
for details of the outcome of the vote see minutes 
explanations of vote
alongside food security and a common foreign and security policy , energy policy plays a crucial role .
pl mr president , I will speak very briefly .
the whole idea is quite right .
i must say that the ukrainian people passed the exam .
the elections were very transparent and democratic , despite the last minute changes which were made to the electoral regulations .
the new president of ukraine , on his first foreign visit since taking office , is coming to brussels .
it is unacceptable from that point of view .
thirdly , one of the basic reasons why I voted against the motion is the reference to bandera .
ukrainians are an educated and industrious people , but they enjoy relatively cheap costs and relatively competitive exports .
all they want is the opportunity to sell .
the european union needs to intervene in the work of the un human rights council .
we are reversing 300 years of democratic development .
el mr president , the question of gender equality faces yet another challenge at the present stage .
we can cut undue expenses and then debate how we can increase our means for law making .
we have a duty to set a good example , but today we are setting a bad one .
lt I greatly welcome the decision adopted on new rules in the fishing sector .
i also hope that this decision will help save disappearing fish species .
yet the fact remains that for my fishing industry , the common fisheries policy continues to wreak havoc .
the focus here mainly needs to be on wild salmon and stocks of wild fish .
we need to draw up a special programme for the recovery of wild salmon .
as I said , the argument is now effectively academic .
it is over .
our fishing ports are sterile .
our oceans are empty .
this will therefore make it possible to intervene in time when any gaps or problems appear .
hence our final decision to abstain .
the effective promotion of our energy policy requires adequate information on infrastructure and I voted accordingly today .
energy infrastructure will be the foundation of our future economic growth .
for these reasons , and in order not to encourage bureaucracy , I voted against the report .
rather , additional financing for new infrastructure investments should be used to improve energy efficiency .
ukraine today is a european country , which has the right to take decisions on europe .
it remains in the period that now follows for these words to be demonstrated by actions as well .
ukraine must steadily build up and strengthen its economy , and come to an agreement over its own needs .
the doors of the european union must stay open for ukraine .
at the beginning of 2010 , ukrainian democracy has shown that it is alive .
for the consequences of bilateral relations between ukraine and russia also concern eu member states .
from my point of view , there were two controversial amendments .
the second amendment was the one about the nord stream pipeline .
sexual and reproductive health and rights need to be acknowledged and furthered in europe and at a global level .
its agenda includes the economic and financial crisis and the united nations declaration on human rights education and training .
this is a provocation .
the trials there are farcical .
torture is used .
i could go on .
the world needs governance that is based on universal values .
to come together to ensure that these rights be respected is our solemn duty .
father joseph wresinski.
it is also a prerequisite for achieving the eu's objectives of economic growth , employment and social cohesion .
in this respect , the european union must continue to make efforts to resolve these issues .
thus , the union has a specific mission of promoting and mainstreaming equality between men and women .
we can address all this only if women will decide for women !
her assessment presents a mixed picture .
for these reasons , we have voted against the resolution .
it is out of the secretarial allowance that mepsassistants are paid .
the treaty of lisbon means greater powers for parliament .
it is out of the secretarial allowance that mepsassistants are paid .
for this reason , the fdp in the european parliament abstained from voting .
this justifies an increase in staff for parliament's and the groupssecretariats in these committees .
however , we do not share the view that we meps need more staff .
in this amending budget , we have reduced the buildings reserve from eur 15 million to eur 11 million .
the crisis is here , and it is true that a large number of companies and citizens are struggling .
it is not a case of us asking for money for ourselves , as alleged by the press .
this budget is not even extravagant .
savings have been made and will continue to be made .
it damages the reputation of this institution .
where are the new assistants to be accommodated ?
now we may be leaving the door wide open to abuse .
it does not differentiate between the measures needed in fisheries areas and overlooks their individual peculiarities .
overfishing , illegal fishing , pollution and climate change are factors which are jeopardising marine ecosystems .
the european union cannot expect europe's fishing fleets to be resized naturally , based on economic realities .
i would also stress the protection of the interests of community fisheries .
we find this unacceptable and therefore elected to voteno.
i would like to begin by highlighting the excellent report produced by mrs patrão neves .
it is important to retain the current quota management system and I do not support mandatory privatisation of quotas .
fisheries management must be returned to the fishing nations those fishing nations must not lose their historical rights .
the fisheries industry is very important in the eu .
this is yet another reason why we must opt for small scale , innovative and sustainable fishing .
we must recognise that a new approach is needed .
this should lead to better management of stocks and have a positive effect on the marine environment .

i have several things to say at the beginning of the session .

i would also like to inform you about something else , about another theft which has taken place .

the president cut off the speaker 
i consider this far better than such a rushed debate .
please keep to the rules .
we will take the vote now .
international women's day
the committee on women's rights and gender equality is an extremely important committee .
it is the hundredth anniversary of that occasion .
only 5 % of world leaders are women .
women account for 75 % of the world's poor .
i should like to devote my closing remark to ourselves here in the european union .
the basic prerequisite for justice in society is that it is administered regardless of a person's gender .
we must rid the eu of this shame .
my fellow member , mrs wortmann kool , has mentioned other examples .
mr president , you exhorted that there should be more women in this parliament .
the achievements are good but they are still not good enough .
on friday , the commission presented a charter of women's rights containing very many fine words .
we can provide educational opportunities and employment , but the pay gap still remains .
as a parliament , we should be working towards assisting women to have a choice in what they do .
the phrasejust a housewifeneeds to be outlawed .
today , we have had the chance to read the commission's document .
there is a major risk that it will not be worth the paper it is written on .
this is what the women and the men of europe need .
however , I do have specific requests for this parliament to defend the women of this world .
both are related to globalisation , the neoliberal economy , liberalised free trade and their drawbacks .
this calls for urgent redress .
international women's day is an excellent opportunity to remind us all of this commitment .
however , coordinated intervention is required in order to protect the common currency against speculation .
so I will say it again endometriosis .
they are treating people in wales like fools .
this paragraph in our resolution has attracted much criticism in western ukraine .
the award should have been accompanied by an effort for reconciliation with the families .
hu slovakia's language law has been the object of numerous critical comments lately .
the opinion deplores the lack of reasonableness and proportionality in the language requirements .
i request that the commission takes the necessary steps to ensure that community law continues to prevail without fail .
this legislative package must also feature in the european union's 2020 strategy .
the rights must be tailored to eu standards and the ilo conventions .
women do not want to and must not pay the price for this reconciliation .
the taliban are still demanding the suppression of women's rights and the return of sharia .
responsibilities therefore lie with politicians .
buckfast wine should , apparently , be banned because it contains both alcohol and caffeine .
the majority should not be punished for the actions of the ignorant few .
nobody forced us to form a monetary union without political union and without social cohesion .
when a euro economy is under attack , it is the euro that is under attack .
it is 19 kilometres long and has a perimeter of 69 kilometres .
the implementation of this law will be positive in areas devastated by urban development .
these facilities are the island's livelihood and have been legally established for between 30 and 40 years .
i believe high representative ashton should act to de escalate those tensions .
the congress of estonia presented a unique democratic alternative to the existing soviet institutions .
i believe that you will all agree with me that any person who breaks the law must pay .
this is an unacceptable situation that should be eliminated urgently .
mr president , my contribution addresses the need for a unified approach to the recognition of kosovo .
one of these is the new integrated and unified proceedings in foreign and neighbourhood policy .
whenever there is an economic crisis , politicians line up to denounce protectionism .
we do not exist to serve economic forces .
at the time , it did apparently find a sympathetic ear .
we gave the floor to about 35 of you .
i would also like to thank the council and the commission .
i hope that colleagues will support this work through their votes .
indeed , our joint work has been complicated and slowed down by this alignment .
on the comitology issue , our group supports the compromise that has been negotiated .
we think that parliament should have parity equality with the council in legislation .
de mr president , commissioner , welcome to the european parliament .
the document covers many areas .
here , the expense bears no relation to the benefit .
free movement for dogs and cats was certainly the goal of the 2003 regulation .
now , for the third time , we are making an exception .
in the eu , some things take a really long time ten years to tune such regulations .
that was an uphill struggle , but it was worth it .
mr president , I just wanted to say a few words in praise of the legislation we have .
of course , we have also kept the balance right .
under the eu pet passport system , this important bulwark against the spread of disease was summarily removed .
as a farmer , I know something about vaccination .
i understand there is no standardisation of enforcement of the scheme .
i think the future is much more important .
however and I know this from our experience in austria there are phenomena that threaten this .
i welcome his statement to the parliament this evening .
as he said , the substance of my report agrees with the approach of the commission's proposal .
written statements rule 149 
revision of the package travel directive debate 
this consultation was closed on 7 february 20the commission is now examining more than 170 contributions , which will feed into the impact assessment .
the commission is planning to present its proposal early in 20the key challenges for the revision will be to define the scope of the directive .
we also launched a public consultation on the future of air passengersrights on 15 december 200these elements will serve as a basis for the impact assessment .
the very fact that the law is still called the package travel directive shows how outdated it is .
consumers must be told where they can get this information and be informed of their rights in the circumstances .
the president asked the speaker to speak more slowly for the sake of the interpreters 
finally , one other idea that the commission might consider is how much does a flight cost ?
now , however , we are talking about people travelling .
that is an important right in europe .
we want mobility and freedom of movement for people and we have considered how we can ensure that .
that was 20 years ago .
now people are frequently booking on the internet themselves and that then leads to loopholes in the system .
i should have liked to hear the commissioner's opinion on this .
therefore , the role of travel agents should be regulated much more precisely .
we have already discussed bankruptcies .
i think 20 years is definitely too long .
we need transparent systems .
i would like to remark that this topic is included among the priorities of the spanish presidency .
i also feel that it is important that websites which offer travel services are accredited .
i think therefore that it is important and necessary to review this directive .
thank you .
cross border problems call for a cross border strategy and approach .
nowadays , more and more people are putting their holidays together themselves and booking trips on the internet .
well , then , what do I believe to be the essential components of this new directive ?
this is only one of the examples of insufficient protection for consumers / airline passengers .
members who have spoken before me have talked about this .
we cannot allow a situation in which we do not know what comes under the directive .
such a situation is not good either for consumers or for business .
all the rest is a matter for the free market .
it would be a good idea to mark journeys covered by the directive with a special european logo .
the latter is only liable if its guilt is proven .
all this is important , but citizens need to know about it in order to exercise these rights .
however , I should like to focus on four points .
finally , there is the question of security .
who could have predicted the rate of change that we have seen in the past 20 years ?
we need to do more so thank you , commissioner .
more and more people are making their own travel arrangements by purchasing services from various operators and service providers .
we are now in the middle of a consultation process .
thank you very much .
the debate is closed .
the original tobin tax idea of using a financial transaction tax for development aid has also strongly resurfaced .
some may say that does not matter .
however , there are also other ways that taxation could be raised within financial services .
are these truly complementary ?
this is our first and preferred option .
this asymmetry points to the need for global solutions , including about the sharing and allocation of revenue .
as a first step , the commission's services are currently examining the issue of innovative financing instruments overall .
if so , how do you then plan to curb them , or what might contribute to curbing them ?
i cannot believe that .
that is what parliament wishes .
i hope that the investigation will be both serious and effective .
the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under rule 149 8 
that is something that we should handle politically in our country .
it is the tax with the least negative consequences for the global competitiveness of the european economy .
if they have , no problem .
if they have not , then we can deduct an entry or exit tax .
we have done so for years in the real economy with the common external tariff .
my concerns are twofold with this financial transaction tax resolution as it stands .
i would not be able to support something that actually raises taxes for other purposes .
saying this is saying to people that the tobin tax will never exist on a global scale .
i have an entirely different view .
citizens would understand this very well .
is it useful for economic development to have a tax on financial transactions ?
firstly , we have 30 years of enormous economic growth thanks to well functioning global financial markets .
i suggest that you take a slightly closer look at that .
why would we rule out a method which could be good for the united states ?
that is not what it is about at all !
that must be paid for another way .
i am , therefore , a fervent supporter of a tax on financial transactions .
these countries are now being forced to borrow from the same banks , thereby paying them twice .
de mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , what is this all about then ?
that is the crucial question that we must answer .
i think that together , we have developed a very balanced text .
that is going too far .
it is a question of involving the financial markets in an internationally coordinated manner .
those who maintain that we can stop speculation with such instruments are clearly deluding themselves .
in doing so , you have our full support commissioner .
we must put an immediate end to this lethal speculation .
should there be earmarking ?
we must resolve all these matters .
please give us an answer quickly .
in this context , a tax on financial transactions designed to fulfil a triple purpose could be very helpful .
what would happen if only europe had this kind of tax ?
there are several elements that must be taken into account .
it is not by means of a new tax that we will solve the problem of public finances .
those in need of credit are the ones who suffer with a new tax .
secondly , there is a series of technical problems to discuss .
is there one european administrative system that might implement a tax such as this one ?
can anyone tell us the cost of this implementation ?
can anyone tell us what its effect on liquidity and credit will be ?
the number of global policy objectives has , however , increased .
this measure could prevent the accumulation of speculative capital .
thank you .
third , we need to get the analysis right .
we are carrying out an analysis and analysing various instruments .
the commission will compare its findings with those of one of its international partners .
on this basis , the more promising instruments will be identified which the commission will assess in further detail .
i would like to thank parliament for its interest and involvement in this topic .
the debate is closed .
banks have not picked up fraudulent cheque practices .
this has happened four years after the uk financial services authority closed that loophole .
that is the fraudster's charter .
a deadline presupposes legislation .
nevertheless , I would like to make several comments .
the court's final rulings should contribute to giving this a firmer legal basis .
the fourth point relates to the future of governance .
my final point concerns respect for the interests of users , a subject which you mentioned , mrs bowles .
there are two issues involved .
secondly , it must , of course , also work for the benefit of the economy .
that is our approach to the discussion .
small countries like my native austria would have otherwise come under immense pressure during the financial crisis of 200firstly , who is responsible for the lack of control in the euro system ?
this will allow all participants once again to present everything that still has to be done .
mr president , I would like to thank all those who spoke for their contribution .
that is confirmed by the draft resolution .
this directive we are now discussing dates from 197it was aimed at large and medium sized businesses . it was never intended for micro entities .
i will stress again that the value is practically zero .
that is why this problem is not of any relevance to the single market .
against this background , we should now bring this never ending story to a conclusion .
so , here we are .
it could even be several years before these provisions were applicable .
we are all in favour of simplification .
firstly , the advantages of implementing universal standards are certainly fewer than in the case of large companies .
this leads to a cost benefit imbalance with regard to application of the standards .
having said that , it is quite clear that the simplification of the accounting obligations for smes is necessary .
we just think that , instead of simplifying things , this proposal creates insecurity for businesses .
it seems that it has very limited reach .
however , in this time of economic hardship , it is important to remember that every little bit helps .
the best hope for the unemployed is with small and micro enterprises .
in the uk , we have over 1.7 million micro firms .
ninety six years ago , britain entered the first world war in order to protect the territorial integrity of belgium .
enterprises that are completely different cannot be dealt with in the same way .
small and large enterprises cannot be dealt with in the same way .
and this was precisely what the party I represent here presented to the portuguese parliament .
micro entities are often not so tiny .
none !
many of us collaborated on the small business act .
if it is so attractive , why is there not applause from all sides ?
we want european solutions and simplifications , not national solutions , not legal fragmentation .
thank you .
i would like to restate my conviction .
this proposal can be implemented quickly .
it is an opportunity to help small businesses that must not be missed .
this global review I have told you , early 2011 will take time .
i clearly heard mr karas and mrs ranner mention minimum requirements or minimum standards .
i also noticed that mr lehne's report does not rule out minimum requirements .
we need time for that .
we will see what we can do about that with the council .
mr president , I would like thank all my fellow members and the commissioner for the debate .
i have six basic comments .
secondly , it is , in fact , completely correct that the compromise provides for minimum provisions .
fourthly , the tax balance sheet provisions remain the same and are not affected by this at all .
all the others are in favour .
the vote will take place at 12 noon on wednesday , 10 march 20written statements rule 149 
the greatest obstacle reported by smes is compliance with administrative formalities .
areas which are unnecessarily regulated should be urgently identified , and such regulations eliminated .
that brings me to the first big issue , namely that of cartels .
they are reprehensible .
sanctions must have a sufficiently deterrent effect .
a second key issue is state aid .
in the context of the economic crisis , huge amounts of state aid have been granted .
exceptional circumstances call for exceptional measures .
it distorts competition and it leads to record levels of public debt and budget deficits .
we have a duty to justify every single cent that has been spent .
to deny that it happens , frankly , is an insult to our intelligence .
on substance , the commission proposals allow for discrimination against online retailers who do not have a bricks and mortar shop .
in the 21st century , we must encourage , not stifle , competition from online retailers .
2008 , the year in which this economic and financial crisis started , was very distinctive .
mr president , the rapporteur referred to cartels .
i think that the report underlines clearly those areas to which the commission should draw particular attention .

by mr buşoi , on behalf of the committee on the internal market and consumer protection , on solvit .
it is over 100 internal market directives .
the member states must do even more for the internal market to become something which benefits all europeans .
we can warmly congratulate the commission on this productive , hard work .
i very much welcome the second edition of the consumer markets scoreboard .
it is incredibly important that we are patient and give the scoreboard time to develop .
it is still in its infancy .
cross border e commerce is also developing more slowly because of border obstacles that leave consumers concerned and lacking in confidence .
we often have problems implementing european internal market legislation .
providing solvit with additional staff obviously incurs some costs as well .
these are just a few of the ideas on which the solvit report is based .
we are talking about the internal market .
this will be our working practice .
it now needs to be translated into concrete action .
free , open , well policed markets encourage competition on quality and price and drive competitiveness .
this benefits not only consumers but also the eu economy as a whole .
what options are available to the citizen who encounters a difficulty ?
secondly is the very poor use made of solvit as a practical instrument .
the situation in france is far worse .
according to the statistics , solvit is looked after by just one individual on work experience .
this is the wrong approach .
that is not the case .
we therefore reject this concept , because it is the wrong one .
not any kind of consumption , however .
we fear that this will lead to the fragmentation of your responsibilities .
the president interrupted the speaker 
this has been proven very clearly once again .
however , the internal market obviously requires citizens to have confidence in it .
we need more instruments that make it clear that citizens are protected in the internal market .
solvit is a very important instrument in this regard .
solvit can provide an important and key addition in this respect .
although we support them , we do have one point of criticism .
the subject of subsidiarity must also be given adequate consideration in this regard .
however , several days ago , the commission published the internal market scoreboard for 200finally , I would like to express support for the two main proposals contained in the thun report .
this paragraph proposes the creation of an internal market test for all new proposed legislation .
we could not agree to it in those circumstances .
i think this is a really significant development that all committees in this parliament need to engage with .
this requires a balance , which parliament needs to find in cooperation with the commission .
the team are integrated into the european regulatory division within the department for business and industry .
it is important that solvit centres are well staffed .
in conclusion , why is there not a solvit day in the european parliament ?
why do we not have a poster in all our constituency office windows advertising solvit ?
i hope we will continue to support solvit and help the people we are here to represent .
another good thing is the focus on enforcement .
as the last speaker mentioned , we could in fact instigate a solvit day here in parliament .
i have personally met the staff who are responsible for solvit in the czech republic .
we are europe .
let us make this act a hallmark of the internal market .
the third strength is the competitive export economy .
this is of particular importance with the increases in cross border trade and e commerce .
in this respect , we must stop hesitating and finally get down to action .
i am pleased that commissioner dalli is taking this up .
we all know that these days , most jobs are created in the services sector .
we need a functioning market in health care services .
that will result in better care , more freedom of choice and shorter waiting times .
of course , promotion is not everything .
it is not enough for the package leaflet to be readable .
however , confidence comes from knowledge .
the president cut off the speaker 
i think possibly and probably the latter .
that brings us to the solutions that are required .
obviously , there is a shortage of staff .
the fact that there is agreement makes me optimistic about the future of the internal market .
it is an extraordinary mechanism but it still requires a great deal of help .
created in 2002 , this network saw its workload increase by 22 % in 200even though the resolution rate remains quite high at 83 % , the number of cases resolved is decreasing .
recently , we have been saying a lot about the need to revive the internal market .
the president cut off the speaker 
the president cut off the speaker 
but can I tell you about some practical examples of consumer problems that come to my office .
just this morning , I had one relating to property transactions across the european union .
the second one relates to business directories .
perhaps at this stage , I might respond to the constructive criticism of mr harbour concerning the 2020 strategy .
at any rate , all these ideas are worthwhile , as mr schwab and mrs roithová stated just now .
i support mrs gruny's idea of organising consultations and seminars .
the commission will carefully evaluate the different options .
we must continue to develop instruments which will help in development of the common market .
we should not react negatively to the wordmarket.
i would like to add a few points of my own .
the report contains some of these solutions , while others have been raised for discussion in this debate .
this is why I am asking all groups to vote for this report .
thank you .

these systems still do not function properly and cannot be relied on in all member states .
it is also necessary to pay attention to the correct application of directives .
this can be achieved through effective cooperation between bodies at national , regional and local levels .
in writing . serious consideration has to be taken as regards existing union wide redress mechanisms such as solvit .
schengen stands for freedom of movement .
however , this does not happen in the vast majority of member states .
in this way , we have responded to any fears of decreased security .
it is essential for this to occur in order to avoid an omission in the law .
i want to thank the rapporteur for his constructive approach to this .
to give a few examples , the proposal shortens the period of validity for long stay visas .
after this one year period , the proposal established the obligation for member states to issue a residence permit .
it is here that I believe the eu's greatness lies .
this type of barrier to freedom of movement must not exist within the eu .
that is to say , they do not use the framework provided by the schengen regulations properly .
they should be the most important beneficiaries of this regulation .
the member states should also take appropriate measures to simplify the procedures for issuing visas .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in a sea of difficulties , stages take shape .
there are at least one million illegal immigrants in britain .
that is nice for him !
yet that is not what this is about , of course .
thanks to his work , I think there is going to be very little disagreement here .
the contracting party must take due account of any information already included in the sis by another contracting party .
two thirds of these people are not making the homeward journey .
they have to suffer the consequences of what is decided by the majority in this chamber .
this is a precarious situation and I appeal to commissioner malmström to intervene in this issue with urgency .
my opinion has been incorporated into the regulation .
i will give only a few examples of matters which have been mentioned in this chamber today .
obviously , each member state will have to be very careful when issuing visas .
so I hope to be able to come back to you soon on developments on this .
it is also within the philosophy of the european union to have an area of no internal borders .
otherwise we shall have a legal loophole , with consequences for real people .
mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund lithuania redundancies 
before the vote 
it is , after all , a protocol that has been far too long in the making .
those are twenty lost years .
solvit 
movement of persons with a long stay visa 
report on competition policy 2008 
internal market scoreboard 
voting time
therefore , I supported the adoption of the report , and I supported its proposals for change .
madam president , I supported this report .
lt rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , I definitely agree with this initiative .
in particular , I agree with the strengthening of the solvit network and the broadening of its activities .
thank you , that is exactly what I wanted to underline .
we occasionally get these messages coming out of the commission that the eu is doing enough .
and then we have all these motions on things like what pets we are allowed to take where .
et the objective of the schengen area is freedom of movement .
it is the over generous and therefore tempting conditions for asylum seekers that are to blame for this .
i fully endorse the author's observations and remarks about introducing and enforcing community law in the member states .
strict penalties must be laid down if , following an analysis , obvious violations are found .
practices absolutely must be observed when investigating complaints at international level and to lay down criteria .
they argue that it would damage the agreed social and environmental standards .
it is important to point out that mobilisation of this fund should be an incentive for redeploying redundant workers .
seven months were required to adopt this decision .
obviously , responses to this disaster also need to be more than merely palliative .
both are worthy applications .
i voted in favour of the report on the mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund .
the financial assistance offered to redundant workers should be made available as quickly and efficiently as possible .
this support is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of relocations that occur in a globalised context .
responses to this disaster also need to be more than mere palliatives .
i voted for the european parliament resolution on the mobilisation of the egf for building construction in lithuania .
the eur 1.1 million will target almost 1 000 workers in this highly sensitive and hard hit sector .
apart from environmental issues , oceanic pollution and european coastal degradation present an economic problem .
as a result , consumer protection measures are steadily growing in importance .
further development of the confidential database on consumer problems is essential for the identification of markets .
i would , however , welcome more concrete proposals for improving the current situation .
in this sense , instruments for monitoring the market , such as the consumer markets scoreboard , are justified .
consumers who are well informed of their rights and obligations contribute to a more transparent and competitive market .
i therefore abstained from voting .
consumers must be aware of their rights .
making maximum use of the possibilities of the single european market is a tremendous challenge for the commission .
i am pleased by the fact that further scoreboards are being planned .
in writing . I welcome this contribution to the consumer scoreboard from parliament .
the position of consumers needs to be strengthened .
sometimes , this almost seems like a game or hypocrisy .
in writing . I welcome the adoption of this report .
i voted in favour of this report on solvit .
i welcome the buşoi report on solvit .
its importance is reflected in the growing number of cases brought over the last year .
however , the increased flow of solvit cases has resulted in several deficiencies with its response .
the internal market offers citizens and companies a host of opportunities .
i voted in favour of the report on solvit .
the report by mr buşoi on solvit is very important .
a good media strategy is certainly needed in order to raise awareness of solvit .
making a unique internet address available can contribute to this .
this can indeed be done by enhancing cooperation between civil servants with a sufficiently high level of knowledge .
they have access to legal advice both within their centre and within the competent administration .
member states should ensure that the centres have proper access to legal expertise within their administration .
i welcome the member statescommitment to monitoring european legislation and its application .
great britain , in particular , is making considerable use of this derogation .
freedom of movement is one of the key pillars of the european single market .
in writing . I voted in favour of mrs de brún's report .
i would like to congratulate all those who worked to secure the agreement on the new comitology procedure .
the eu 2020 strategy is a document that offers much hope .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we voted against mr coelho's report .
adoption of this regulation is a necessity and a matter of urgency .
particular attention is paid to issues concerning cartels and consumers .
during an economic crisis there is a risk of increasing the level of protectionism .
it is for that reason that I have voted against this report .
indeed , I share this positive view this change in the commission's approach should be noted .
i welcome this .
unfortunately , consumers are still struggling with problems relating to making use of the benefits of competition .
their rights must be protected , but they need to be more aware and have greater knowledge .
absence of competition is directly detrimental to consumers , as it also is to the economy .
however , the internal market cannot function effectively without correctly transposed , applied and enforced community rules .
recently , we have said a lot in the european parliament about the necessity of strengthening the internal market .
mr president , an effectively working internal market is reliant on satisfied consumers who have confidence in it .
european consumers are vitally important as we move from recession into growth .
i will mention three of these .
how can we ensure that the voices of 500 million europeans are heard loud and clear ?
as you know , the commission must consent to the council's decision on the creation of the service .
could you please tell us which heads of government of which member states we are talking about ?
that in itself is an enormous change from recent years .
according to a commission spokesperson , mr barroso , things are currently moving quickly .
i would first like to thank the president of the commission for his answer .
we wanted all concerns regarding the possible presence of an antibiotic resistance marker gene to be thoroughly assessed .
why suddenly change it to 0.9 % ?
i do not have any position in favour or against .
it depends on the opinion that is given to me by experts of the efsa .
the commission has a position that is to follow in those matters .
protests 
it is companies that create job opportunities .
secondly , can you promise a significant reduction in european legislation , which is slowing down economic growth considerably ?
president of the commission . first of all , we fully respect the diversity of our member states .
regarding the issue of reducing the administrative burden , that has been a very important point in my programme .
mr barroso , last week you presented your proposal for an economic strategy .
however , you continue to persist with the failed stability and growth pact .
it would include stringent conditionality .
apart from its own errors , greece was hard hit by market speculation .
mr president , is there a timetable for all this , for the mechanism to combat speculation ?
we intend to put the issue of credit default swaps to the g20 in june .
i should appreciate your response to this .
the budget for the college is fixed annually by the budgetary authority .
just make them public .
now we will concentrate on the subject of implementation of the new treaty and fundamental rights .
it might therefore be useful to hear mr barroso's view on the state of eritrea in particular .
if not , we will have a kind of discrimination in the evaluation of security at our airports .
this is now recognised also by the lisbon treaty as one of the goals of the european union .
i would like to raise a case about fundamental rights .
her case is being raised by civil society , human rights organisations and churches across scotland .
it is clear that the government is doing what the constitution prohibits .
interjection from the floor you can't do that !
it was negotiated and we have an intergovernmental treaty that recognises this .
the charter has not appeared from nowhere .
president barroso , the question I would like to raise today concerns the financial situation in greece .
here in parliament , we said a clearnoto the swift agreement .
currently we are taking consultations to ensure transparency and collect the views of stakeholders and citizens .
that matter has always been an issue of dialogue with our american partners .
at the same time , we need to have a framework to combat terrorism together .
human rights always seem to take second and third place in our dialogues .
i would like to hear your opinion on these issues .
president of the commission . the provisions of the treaty work to promote human rights throughout the world .
mt one of the fundamental principles is freedom of movement .
president of the commission . we are very concerned with this case .
intense diplomatic efforts are ongoing to find a solution to the crisis .
this is a positive step .
can the president of the commission provide us with this information already today ?
president of the commission . when these rulings were made public , we expressed our position very clearly .
i should underline the fact that 43 % is the estimated level of financial errors .
there has been progress in some areas , to be fair .
applause 
i fully share the wish expressed by this parliament that the eu should move beyond the 20 % target .
as you also stated in your resolution , the crisis has made it easier to achieve the targets .
in parallel with this work , the eu must start implementing the copenhagen accord .
this means building a robust and transparent international accounting framework for countriesemissions and performance .
this is particularly important for our credibility , as well as contributing to securing long term finance .
most importantly , I think it is very important to see what can be specific deliverables for cancún .
environmental integrity must be our watchwords in the negotiations and I know this is a concern parliament shares .
therefore , the shortcomings of the kyoto protocol have to be addressed .
the commission will undertake outreach in close contact with the council and the council presidency .
every project that does not take this into account is doomed to failure .
am I right in saying that you have suggested a new and more subjective formula for applying that ?
why is there nothing in the document that analyses the reasons for failure at copenhagen and suggests lessons ?
and , finally , why is there nothing here about the need to bring in more business ?
there are things , details , leaked mails and all these kinds of things .
but only once can you do a thing like this and then not achieve it fully .
why not , then , make a specific roadmap in bonn , guaranteeing momentum is being kept here ?
that is the thinking .
finally , to chris davies , yes you are right .
what is going on in washington ?
i know that this is one area where there is not consensus in europe at this stage .
i think it is important to consider this .
how much will each developed country give ?
how and when will it be provided ?
the commissioner also spoke of an ambitious , legally binding agreement .
the other question was how much should be given to developing countries , as I understood it .
of course , nobody should be naive .
of course , we should take care of our own industry , obviously .
i am not saying it is going to be easy .
my question to you is as follows .
do you have an opinion on this ?
that is not my approach .
what would happen if we do not adopt something until 2011 or 2012 ?
what is the future for the kyoto protocol ?
fr madam president , I would like to welcome mrs hedegaard to our chamber .
i have two questions , commissioner one is on the quick start money .
we all know there are problems with the kyoto protocol .
we cannot stand there alone in the kyoto protocol .
the eu in this context is not the problem .
i would very much like to work with parliament .
it is also important to bring the topic of climate change into all summits and high level meetings .
i am going to focus on the things that I disagree with .
is it the heads of state ?
have we really taken note of the fact that europe's influence in climate policy has diminished ?
that is the thinking behind this paper .
i do not agree that the eu does not have an impact on international negotiations .
i am trying to make it difficult for them not to deliver in mexico .
there are a lot of factors to take into account what do we think ?
what are we hearing ?
thank you all for this disciplined debate .
i hope that we will see each other more often here in plenary .
written statements rule 149 
climate change is a certainty , just as it is a certainty that pollution accelerates it .
the benefits from this include more than just the immediate benefit of a cleaner environment .
we do not need a war .
what is needed is immediate revision of the climate and energy package .
europe should give developing countries real support which favours the community's ambitious emissions objectives .
mrs hedegaard , the question is simple is there a climate for such change in europe ?
the second aspect is the importance of theresource efficient europeflagship initiative .
b7 0013 / 2010 b7 0014 / 2010 b7 0202 / 2010 b7 0203 / 2010 .
all this is provided for and financed by the state .
their marginalised situation is compounded by their lack of awareness of their rights .
we understand the need to commit to both short term and long term measures .
it will then help us to contribute to a common perspective for the future .
you can see a glass as being half full or half empty .
of course , there have been significant improvements but there are also significant gaps .
it needs a lot of concrete work .
others will be organised in the future .
this communication will then be the basis of the discussion in córdoba .
this creates serious obstacles in the way of the social development of europe .
according to the european people's party , these are the essential issues which the córdoba summit should address .
roma mainstreamingshould become the working approach of all eu institutions .
secondly , the integration of the roma cannot be enforced by means of european funds and european legislation .
however , the majority of governments implement projects that are merely sporadic measures .
we urgently need measures for the economic development of the roma communities .
let us take action now .
the same support and social benefits are being given to the unemployed roma as to other citizens .
so what is the result ?
this item on the agenda is action against the exclusion and discrimination of the gipsy .
there is no way out without creating jobs .
even the difficult social situation cannot justify the violation of the law .
in hungary , gypsies are involved in a very high percentage of crime .
responses cannot be local .
the european union must therefore include the gender perspective in all studies and laws that concern the roma .
however , in order to achieve this , we must take the necessary steps to remove the existing obstacles .
this is another reason for this parliament to be active on this issue .
many countries are singling us out because of this issue .
the roma minority must act responsibly in order to improve their standard of living .
roma inclusion would give us a chance to move forward towards making the european labour market truly inclusive .
the fourth and particularly important point is that we need integration without assimilation .
we do not have exact estimates as to the actual number of roma in the eu .
however , we know that the roma minority is the largest and poorest cross border ethnic minority .
i think that the time has come for us to shift from good intentions to deeds .
however , it has only become topical in recent years , with the enlargement of the european union .
the social problems affecting roma require concerted , long term action , involving the european union and member states .
important initiatives have been launched in this area , but I believe that we need to go further .
i also agree that it is necessary to eliminate the hidden and overt discrimination of roma .
roma children , to a predominant degree , do not have that .
now , we do have instruments we do have policies .
the question is , how do we utilise them ?
how do we mainstream the question and the problems of the roma in these instruments and policies ?
the commission pursues this approach in the european platform for roma inclusion and with its internal procedures .
results are needed results which lead to the integration of roma into mainstream schools .
so there must be some problem with the computer .
my fellow member , mrs kinga göncz , also has the name tabajdi displayed on the card .
please check it , as I do not want to have so many clones in the european parliament .
thank you .
the vote will take place at the next part session .
i wish that this second european roma summit brings about a real eu strategy for roma .
i am convinced that the basic tool for tackling this is education .
the financial crisis has highlighted the extent to which member states are vulnerable to a wide range of risks .
the commission remains committed to strengthening the internal market in the area of pension funds .
i am referring here to the fact that the birth rate soared in the 1970s .
recent flooding in ireland has caused approximately € 500 million worth of damage to both private and public infrastructure .
the 2009 white paper on adapting to climate change suggests having publicly supported insurance systems where no insurance exists .
we were all obviously very concerned about madeira and france .
in my own country , fortunately , nobody was killed but the insurance problem manifested itself very quickly .
would he consider sanctions of some nature for them as well ?
in 1995 , I was the minister with responsibility for flooding in ireland .
and yet many of the houses looking for compensation in parts of ireland were built post that .
we do not have a single centre which could react to disaster situations .
flooding , mr kelly , is not an issue for which I have responsibility .
we will work very closely with the two presidencies this year the spanish presidency and the belgian presidency .
but it is not only governments we have to work with , but also ngos .
these are the main issues and they cover various directions where the commission acts to reduce poverty .
ro thank you for your reply .
thank you .
i would like to draw your attention to two more flagship initiatives .
his final report will be submitted in the second half of this year .
the national authorities participate in groups of experts at european level in order to formulate the programme development policy .
the president cut off the speaker 
i think that speaks for itself in terms of how europe thinks about these monuments .
i would like to thank the commissioner for her response .
actions for 2009 have already been approved and they are to be enforced this year .
this will certainly be taken into account when we formulate our more permanent programme on sport .
subject road deaths
many of those actions have involved the european parliament under the codecision procedure .
besides control and sanctions , education and awareness are areas to which the commission will give strong emphasis .
the commission expects the ongoing druid research project to provide ideas for concrete action .
to reach maximum efficiency , solutions must respond to concrete problems on the ground .
however , it is clear that we are not researching the effect of drugs in these cases .
i propose to the commissioner that we must do a lot more .
i welcome the research but we must do a lot more with regard to making it effective .
we do , of course , need more .
we must now find and abolish the bottlenecks that stop us taking full advantage of railways .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together 
subject causes of the dreadful train crash on monday , 15 february in buizingen
how ?
did any delay occur in comparison with the scheduled date of introduction ?
which countries score best ?
ertms specifications have been available since 2000 .
a number of pilot projects were carried out between 2000 and 200since 2005 , several ertms equipped lines have been put into service .
the ertms will , therefore , probably coexist with national systems for a period of 20 years .
i have one more question for you , commissioner .
vice president of the commission . firstly , on the operators and social questions .
so it does not mean that we can find one very simple answer as to why this accident happened .
so we restored the present summer time regime , turning the clock twice a year .
subject the freedom / security balance
it is imperative that this is included .
i shall be perfectly happy to get a reply from the commissioner in writing .
we should develop strategies for these people in the same way as we do for others .
there is nothing so unfair as treating unequal groups equally .
vice president of the commission . I agree with the honourable member .
there is nothing more unfair than treating unequal groups in the same way .
fr mr president , I fully understand the timing requirements .
the sitting was suspended at 19.50 and resumed at 21.00 
we have concerns regarding the powers and independence of regulators and infrastructure managers in some of these member states .
today , we need to know many things .
today , we need to know what the commission is doing to enforce european law on this issue .
transborder european passenger trains will be stifled .
the single market will never be delivered , and the ertms will never happen .
i have always had strong support in parliament and I hope this will continue .
on the other hand , there are still economic and technical barriers to market entry .
liberalisation was intended to allow new players onto the market .
in practice , things look rather different in this regard , too .
that has been the case in most countries and it is still the case today .
only if we tackle this in a consistent , coherent manner can we achieve our objective .
you mentioned the different rail systems , commissioner , but that cannot be the only reason .
i am also eager to see when you might be able to carry out this revision of the directive .
mr president , commissioner , the inspiration for the first railway package came almost 15 years ago .
in addition , you have mentioned newcomers .
the ertms is supposed to be a magic formula that should technically unify both infrastructure and rolling stock .
labour was once socialist , and he was elected by people who still think labour is socialist .
he is calling for privatisation .
i believe that this review is long overdue .
i am thinking of the matter of safety .
austrian railways now travel this route five times a day .
i just want to reply to some remarks .
we must change the old system of state owned monopolies with great privileges and no interoperability .
that is the purpose of developing this railway reform .
the problem is precisely that this has not been completed .
you cannot then expect a high level of quality control .
adequate financing remains a very big problem , and we need to find innovative ways to finance the bottlenecks .
this then limits the possibilities for investment , for example , in new rolling stock .
by strengthening , I mean increasing their independence and effectiveness , improving the quality of staff , etc .
the main issue today is transparency , although naturally , the content is also sensitive .
we now estimate that counterfeit goods to the value of around eur 250 billion are flooding our market .
the second question that is of concern to me is this who is actually negotiating the acta agreement ?
there is also the question of compensation .
of course , my third question , commissioner , is what is the actual relationship between online and offline ?
would you please provide answers to these three questions .
i totally agree with the criticism levelled by my fellow members .
you continue to fob us off with two page summaries of the results of whole negotiating rounds .
lay the negotiation documents on the table straight away .
we have seen leaks purporting to be official documents .
that is not unusual .
they will be at your disposal for discussion before and after each further negotiating round .
this would give you a very clear picture of where exactly we are in those negotiations .
however , a few acta negotiating parties remain opposed to early release .
i strongly disagree with their approach but I cannot unilaterally breach a confidentiality commitment .
my credibility as a negotiator is at stake .
first , the objective is to address large scale infringements of intellectual property rights which have a significant commercial impact .
it will not lead to the limitation of civil liberties or harassment of consumers .
secondly , acta is only about enforcement of intellectual property rights .
there will be no harmonisation or changes to eu legislation through the back door .
even though we might frown on it , nobody should be criminalised for personal use of copyright material .
of course , any action through acta has to be proportional to the aims .
there has not been any debate to establish the aims and principles of the eu .
they have actually managed to get ordinary citizens interested in eu politics .
acta is an issue that people on the net really care about .
they are furious at the complete lack of transparency .
this is not how it should be in a democracy .
nevertheless , I will now turn to the matter in hand .
i also have concerns over the actual effectiveness of this agreement .
i want to have all the documents on the table now , and for all citizens .
the anti counterfeiting trade agreement acta is one such dossier .
is there anything more ridiculous ?
this freedom would now be under serious threat , which cannot and must not happen .
the member states have absolutely no say in this dossier any more .
why is it almost exclusively american companies who are involved in the consultations what are they doing there ?
are they there to safeguard their commercial interests ?
this is where the importance of the pvv becomes clear .
do you really believe this will happen ?
if we are to assess the need for acta , we must bear this international context in mind .
the resolution is along these lines and , as such , it is worthy of our vote .
however , there are two reasons why I absolutely cannot smile about this .
that would , of course , be contrary to the new electronic communications framework directive .
that would , of course , be contrary to the e commerce directive .
nothing , absolutely nothing .
of course , we cannot be certain of this because we have received no information from you .
as the commission , you are the guardian of the treaties .
therefore , the group of the greens / european free alliance says act now . act on acta !
commissioner , put this agreement on the table immediately .
countries must abide by and respect their shared obligations so as to combat counterfeiting and piracy more effectively .
this time , it is trade interests rather than the fight against terrorism that are at issue .
is commissioner de gucht going to inform his colleagues about the substance of the agreement at any stage ?
we need credibility for the protection of innovation that you are putting forward here as the main argument .
that , commissioner , is the wrong way to go .
otherwise , they would be exposing themselves to legal actions by right holders and would be systematically penalised .
we need as many trading partners as possible to join the multilateral agreement being discussed .
interesting question , what about china ?
well , china is not , as you know , ms roithová , a party to the present negotiations .
i will do my utmost to have the agreement of the contracting parties that we can fully inform you .
the fact is , parliament will oppose any undermining of the acquis communautaire .
however , the treaty of lisbon does , now , foresee such a procedure .
however that is an issue for another day .
it must be treated and protected as such .
trade agreements must not be misused in order to curtail the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals .
regulation applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences debate 
has the existing system really facilitated trade for the states that benefit from it ?
are the right countries benefiting from this system ?
we were promised it by june and we would like to see it delivered by june .
we do not know .
however , the real reason for the debate this evening is the regrettable case of colombia .
what hope have the poor and working people outside the borders of europe in view of that situation ?
you should receive this document in april .
think , for example , of the recent case with sri lanka .
the commission should draft the new regulation on gsp as soon as possible .
this system must be reviewed .
so , commissioner , please speed things up .
thirdly , who actually initiates an investigation if any problems are detected ?
de mr president , gsp mainly grants trade privileges to developing countries and emerging economies .
the gsp + special arrangement is intended to bring about the implementation of social and environmental standards .
it is also the reason for the increase in the signing of un and ilo conventions .
the next step will be the joint resolution .
we have been asked to do that as soon as possible , and will do so .
as you will know , we are scheduled to meet tomorrow .
the debate is closed .
implementation of goldstone recommendations on israel / palestine motions for resolutions tabled see minutes
situation of civil society and national minorities in belarus motions for resolutions tabled see minutes
the report continues with a geographical analysis of what we can hope to achieve .
africa positive contribution of the somali coast defence mission .
that fundamental achievement can be built on further .
we expect your guidance on this major issue , baroness ashton .
no one can hope to be an island of stability and prosperity in a sea of insecurity and injustice .
ours is , if I may say , a world in flux .
to me , the most striking features of today's world are twofold .
we are connected in ways we have never been before .
we need to adapt .
europe's share of the world's population is 7 % , down from 25 % a century ago .
if not , others will make the decisions for us .
if you want results , you have to act and sometimes take risks .
and yes , there is a tendency in europe to put process ahead of outcomes .
a huge chance for europe .
we should not lower our ambitions but , rather , give ourselves the means to realise them .
a moment to see the big picture , to be creative and take collective responsibility .
the european perspective remains the overarching framework both as our objective and as the main incentive for reform .
we are backing up our strategy with available foreign policy tools .
in kosovo , we have our biggest civilian mission and it is a success .
the way we are engaged in georgia follows the same script .
we continue to promote those reforms and closer ties .
it is striking to me how far we have come in the last ten years .
the un is another key partner .
we have to ensure that supply matches demand .
we should not build a service which preserves the old national competition or the present bureaucratic structure .
on the black sea , we have to move from synergy to strategy .
let us work together parliament , the commission and the council to accomplish this task .
both you and we knew that you were taking on a well nigh impossible task .
in many cases , we need joint plans and programmes from the external action service and the commission .
i would like to hear your position on this .
so , my question in this connection , too , is what are your plans in this regard ?
we would like to see a similar approach from the member states and the commission .
we will support you in your efforts if you can show that you are up to the daunting challenge .
there are more general points .
the main weapons of mass destruction in the world today are hunger and poverty .
no , neither terrorism nor organised crime should be military targets .
we do not agree with having united states military bases in the european union .
to control such enormous migratory flows by means of repressive measures and domestic policy alone would be unthinkable .
on the contrary , it would encourage new arrivals .
emigration must be a choice and not a necessity .
think , for example , of austria's historical experience with the western balkans .
european money is definitely better spent on frontex than in the deserts of afghanistan .
to mr kasoulides , on the non proliferation treaty review , it is vital that it succeeds above anything else .
i think you mentioned , for example , russia and turkey .
so I would agree wholeheartedly with the priorities that you set out and thank you for those .
mrs neyts uyttebroeck , thank you for your kind words .
i think it was not so much that the eu disappeared from the world stage .
and we are now in a position where we can begin to put the resources together .
it does not have a staffing structure .
it is not there yet .
i think on those issues , we are in exactly the same place .
in other words , it is a joined up approach and it is a comprehensive approach .
finally , mr mölzer , do not be so pessimistic , is what I want to say to you .
it is not the same .
we want this external action service .
it must be successful .
there are two imminent and significant decisions to be made in terms of our direction of travel .
we are saying this very plainly .
i will thus also finish on something that has already been said .
applause 
article 40 protects the respective functions of the commission and the council .
de the new report , like the albertini report , supports a union training mission in somalia .
we in the group of the greens / european free alliance reject that idea .
for me , that is excessive we are biting off more than we can chew here .
such a view is cynical and inhuman .
council and commission , how do you view china's role in the balkans ?
de mr president , let me briefly address two issues .
the committee did not accept this , primarily from a content point of view .
essentially , baroness ashton , we want you to play a key role .
on this point , I would like to focus attention on one important aspect of our joint cooperation .
this is why I am taking the opportunity in this debate to make an appeal .
baroness ashton , in the current state in which bosnia finds itself , stability and stabilisation are actually dangerous .
that is only partially true .
there is still much to be done here , for example , visa liberalisation for the citizens .
will you set up a dedicated directorate general for peace building ?
this means that they themselves decide where , when and how they participate and provide assistance .
now you seem to have changed your mind .
i would be very interested to know what you really think now .
i believe that the new order has brought with it a new global economic disorder .
unfortunately , your presentation contains very little in the way of strategic vision .
a trend that can also be observed in candidate countries like turkey .
you have not answered that question .
our reports refer to the old times .
it is a hybrid with an electric engine of community method and a diesel engine of intergovernmental method .
parliament is ready to fill the gap of parenthood .
secondly , we support close cooperation with nato .
this proves that there are people with expertise in this parliament .
how can we have a credible foreign policy when it has an incredible high representative ?
but , baroness ashton , you are the highest paid female politician in the world .
to top it all , yesterday it was reported that you are being provided with a learjet .
that would get you to the moon , and most people now would like you to stay there .
thank you .
restoring political will in this respect is thus indispensable for a successful csdp .
i want to thank mr danjean and my colleagues for their contributions .
that is highly necessary if we are to achieve a pan european alignment .
secondly , it is right that transatlantic relations have been mentioned .
therefore , it is an immediate task for the eu to work out a european cyber security strategy .
i would have liked you to have attended , baroness ashton .
i also regret that the king of morocco was not present .
the eu states and russia face many common challenges and threats .
cooperation is necessary and cooperation should be the basis for a new comprehensive agreement between the eu and russia .
now for two points .
that greater stability and security in the balkans , our part of the world , is your key objective .
we really cannot afford any failure in this regard .
you have moved from rejection to a test phase .
on that basis , I am not sure that we should be restricting this to a single department .
the union must , of course , build the framework of the common security and defence policy .
we must , therefore , strengthen our operational capabilities .
europe needs you to be successful .
i therefore voted for those proposed amendments that seek to facilitate this sort of participation and catching up .
the first is the political situation in the middle east .
pl a coherent and effective policy is the main message of mr albertini's report .
they killed him in order to stop the normalisation , democratisation and europeanisation of serbia .
this event has also had a negative impact on the neighbouring countries and the region as a whole .
such weapons and technologies have been proliferating .
there is a growing risk of nuclear technology falling into the hands of criminal and terrorist organisations .
i also agree that security begins with strong political relations .
i have indicated in my priorities that this is an incredibly important area of work .
working groups I think it is a very good idea for parliament to have them .
i agree as well about the strong relationship transatlantically with the united states .
we also need to think about other big partnerships .
this is a very important issue .
i agree with that completely , but it will take me time to do it .
remember , as honourable members know , it does not exist at all at the moment .
i will appoint on merit and nothing else .
with parliament supporting me , I am sure we will , so we can get this into being .
we were well represented at the morocco summit because both presidents were there .
it does not always require me to be there as well , and they would agree with that .
this is what is meant by the strategic autonomy that we are developing by means of this policy .
the development of the transatlantic partnership must be a priority in the european union's foreign and security policy .
therefore , the immediate cessation of the development , production and storage of nuclear arms is necessary .
the european institutions must come to an understanding on the eeas .
i would like to make several remarks on the european security strategy and the common security and defence policy .
situation of civil society and national minorities in belarus 
mr president , this report deals with the common foreign and security policy in 200we should pay tribute to her and to the other courageous tibetans living under the occupation .
it is a small change , but it would allow us to vote in favour .
the implementation of the european security strategy and the common security and defence policy 
non proliferation treaty vote 
applause 
i am very considerate .
however , I feel that progress on certain aspects has not gone far enough .
i also welcome the attention to the development of the hi tech , knowledge economy and science .
however , we must recognise that each european union .
i am sorry but I think we have heard enough .
thank you so much , mr uspaskich .
i have cut you off .
another good feature is the greater emphasis on support for small and medium sized enterprises .
without the development of such firms , an improvement of the situation in the union will not be possible .
some people think the strategy says too little about cohesion policy .
at the moment , however , it is more like a wish list .
we are going to verify the strategy in the european union's seven year budget from 20 hu I voted against the eu 2020 strategy .
it stipulates that rules will enter into force automatically if member states do not transpose them in time .
nl mr president , the goldstone report is too one sided .
more than 600 members of the european parliament quite rightly voted in favour of considering hamas a terrorist organisation .
they have been stripped of all context .
it has our support in those efforts .
pl I voted in favour of adopting the belarus resolution .
in his opinion , those intentions arose as a result of unobjective coverage of the situation in polish media .
the intentions which are behind the resolution are much more profound .
they are democracy , human rights and freedom of opinion .
personally , I would like our parliament to express the same reservations about the heroes of other foreign countries .
first of all , we oppose new tax raising powers for the european union .
we do not need a financial tax .
the answer is that it ticks all the boxes of a certain kind of member of this house .
i welcome the comments made last night by the commissioner and look forward to more transparency .
such conduct is not indicative of good communication between the most important institutions of the european union .
it was nato forces that protected the rest of europe from this nightmare .
el mr president , thank you for your patience .
micro enterprises will obviously continue to keep accounting records , in accordance with the national laws of each member state .
those companies that carry out cross border trade , in particular , would be put at a disadvantage .
the only sensible solution is to simplify the rules for all micro enterprises in europe on an eu wide basis .
cutting red tape is important in this context .
let us be clear , the consequences of this proposal have been woefully underestimated .
however , I do not support the idea of exempting micro enterprises from the duty to submit annual accounts .
for these reasons , I voted to reject the commission's proposal .
small enterprises frequently complain about the excessive regulation , burdens and bureaucracy that often endanger their financial survival .
i regard the commission's proposal for simplification as positive .
let us hope that the eu 2020 strategy will provide it .
above all , let us hope that the 27 member states will do their utmost to implement this strategy .
the myriad good intentions are matched only by the absence of new instruments with which to implement them .
europe needs a different ambition the citizens expect more convincing responses .
the greek crisis serves to reveal our lack of solidarity .
eu policy cannot be merely the sum of 27 national policies .
the efficient use of resources becomes a necessity owing to this principle and deriving from the need for sustainability .
the consensus which exists between the right and social democrats regarding these approaches has been made quite clear .
in following this approach , the strategy will itself be the origin of new and deeper crises .
the rejection of our motion for a resolution is regrettable .
europe must be aware that around 40 million jobs depend on agriculture , directly or indirectly .
i voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution of the european parliament .
economic reconstruction and realisation of the objectives of environmental policy are included in agricultural policy .
it would appear that social policy and employment policy are being adapted selectively and flexibly to market forces .
europe is not the world's most competitive economy in 20that is why I support the determination tinged with pragmatism of the new 2020 strategy .
whether the 27 capitals cooperate is another matter , however .
the eu parliament was sidelined during the design of eu 2020 strategy .
this is an objective that we must attain step by step , not least because of climate change .
a strong , modern and flexible cohesion policy must be a central element of this strategy .
this impetus towards structural reform is reflected in the2020 strategyproposed by the commission .
i therefore emphatically voted in favour of this resolution .
the absence of a list of poverty indicators inadvertently demonstrates a lack of understanding of what poverty means .
following the withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza , the number of rocket attacks has risen by 500 % .
in writing . we decided to abstain on all of the votes on palestine and israel .
in particular , we recognise that attacks on civilians either by states or by organisations are entirely unacceptable .
my votes in parliament on 10 march 2010 reflect my conscience on this subject .
the loss of human lives was coupled with the destruction of most civilian infrastructure .
the same causes are the launching of rockets over israeli cities .
however , I strongly disagree with the ideas of right wing political islam and of hamas .
the israeli government does not serve the interests of the palestinian masses , nor of the israeli working class .
attacks on living standards and democratic rights need to be jointly defeated by israeli and palestinian workers .
i hope the process of lasting peace through a two state solution will be supported by the goldstone findings .
every suspicion that human rights have been violated , by any of the sides , should be checked .
nor is there any information on the way hamas has ignored the ceasefire .
according to the report , the parties involved committed violations of international humanitarian law .
we are now awaiting a response .
that is why I welcome the adoption by a wide margin of the resolution on taxes on financial transactions .
the financial sector has to accept its responsibilities for the economic crisis that still plagues us .
it has strong support from the public and from ngos and unions across europe .
this is considerable progress .
pressure must now be exerted on the commission to propose concrete steps .
public administrationsmigration to sepa is below our expectations .
in writing . I voted for this resolution .
however , I am very disappointed at how those negotiations are taking place .
in short , counterfeiting and copying cannot be treated in the same way .
it is a catastrophic violation of individual private property .
that is why we voted in favour .
piracy and counterfeiting are a growing problem for the european economy and for other economies throughout the world .
the european parliament and european citizens are not being kept up to date about progress in the negotiations .
its implementation is unsatisfactory , however .
the report calls for 
i do not agree with the link between the eu and nato established by the treaty of lisbon .
instead , I support demilitarisation and zero armament .
this report attempts to position the eu as a stronger global actor .
the demand for a stronger financial footing must therefore be rejected , given this context .
europe is divided on this issue .
it promotes the rapid organisation of the european external action service with political and military competences .
the path of peace requires a break with these policies .
subject to the following remarks , I voted in favour of the danjean report .
i am also opposed to this text because it refers to the treaty of lisbon and its application .
such a centre would enable us to both plan and execute diverse operations more efficiently .
in addition , avoiding duplication of work would also lead to cost savings .
i have voted against the report .
as a citizen of a non aligned country , I cannot support this far reaching report .
international changes provide new opportunities on the issue of non proliferation .
i am delighted that the european parliament has clearly adopted the report on the non proliferation of nuclear weapons .
we are strongly in favour of a robust and effective non proliferation treaty .
however , the resolution as it stands includes some unhelpful elements and the ecr group therefore abstained .
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
there are three main areas for the work which I would like to mention very briefly .
as you know , this is also the view of the council .
the eu will certainly not be planting its flag on the seabed , as the russians have done .
you underlined the fragile nature and environment of the arctic .
the arctic also presents itself as a unique opportunity for multinational cooperation .
this could seriously undermine a very precious cooperation and it has to be treated with some seriousness .
likewise , we the eu have been rebuffed for observer status .
but thank you for the start .
on the one hand , we are concerned .
it is releasing methane from the tundra , and could also release it from the seabed .
furthermore , the indigenous peoples should be included in all decisionmaking processes that relate to the region .
shipping companies also need to acknowledge the enormous difficulties and risks that exist in the region .
the union's ad hoc observer status in the arctic council is inadequate for this purpose .
we know to our cost that russia sometimes follows its own rule book in international affairs .
we cannot allow the arctic to become the new arena for russia's expansionist tendencies .
however , the crucial question for my group is from what angle we should approach the arctic .
we in finland are familiar with conditions in the arctic .
we live there .
however , we already know all this .
global warming has caused the ice to recede significantly .
however , the melting of the arctic ice cap has numerous , drastic consequences .
it speeds up climate change .
at the same time , the melting of the ice has caused unforeseen changes in sea currents .
two arctic states , iceland and norway , are members of the eea .
i am very sorry , but we had no interpretation for the last part of your speech .
in my view , we should leave the arctic to those countries which are directly involved in the region .
the un has now announced a review of the ipcc's dodgy dossiers and fiddled statistics .
some eu member states lie within the arctic region .
other parts of the region are the eu's immediate neighbours to the north .
the effect of climate change is fundamentally changing the situation in the arctic region .
until now , no arrangement has been applied to the arctic region .
the european parliament has underlined the importance of the governance of the arctic on more than one occasion .
i want to say a few words about the rights of the indigenous people of the arctic .
at the hearings , it was clear that the high representative has forgotten nothing and has learnt nothing .
and , by the way .
the president cut off the speaker 
we will not have personal comments of that nature .
the arctic region , however , needs a comprehensive approach , as the high representative said here .
furthermore , the eu's arctic policy needs its own strategy , and it should be jointly coordinated .
an appropriate way for the eu to be involved in the arctic would be to establish an arctic centre .
i wish you a pleasant trip to lapland .
if we are talking about further development of the technology , then this must be in all areas .
i hope it will be held in an objective and open way .
disputes between russia , norway , the us and canada obviously have a geopolitical significance as well .
i follow with displeasure the disputes over both new and historical possessions .
take an active coordinating role in reaching international agreements on all of these issues relating to the arctic .
it should not go unnoticed when countries do not play by the international rules which apply to this region .
now , that is a position that I would like to see the eu and the high representative endorse .
ultimately , the suspected oil and gas reserves to be found there could guarantee europe's energy independence .
i would very much like to encourage you to continue on this route in this eu arctic debate .
in addition , the global climate system depends on its stability .
protecting icebergs and the polar cap from uncontrolled human intervention is an absolute must .
you have proven already not to be capable of doing this job .
i believe , too , that the arctic council has much to contribute .
there is a big meeting to discuss issues with some of the foreign ministers .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 149 
a spectre is hovering over the arctic .
the spectre of global warming .
a ruthless race is in prospect a madness on the scale of the 19th century gold rush .
this must be the european union's commitment .
firstly , there is political dialogue .
it also involves promoting progress in terms of culture and democratic practices in cuba .
this text does , however , have significant added value .
i therefore appeal to you .
we do not agree with the way that this house manipulates the issue of human rights .
what is happening with the civilian victims in afghanistan ?
why is this ?
today , this tragedy , this tragic death , has acquired symbolic significance .
detaining people for their ideals runs totally counter to the universal declaration on human rights .
even if you imprison people behind walls or put them behind bars , their ideas will continue to survive .
has cuba not already had years of experience of this ?
political dialogue is the only instrument for moving forward .
depriving citizens of their freedom is a crime .
in fact , this should be the first condition for any kind of dialogue with cuba .
pl madam president , we remember fidel castro's famous cry ofsocialism or death.
today , we can safely say that , from this cry , only death remains .
however , there is also the path which romania took in its bloody overthrow of the regime .
this , too , should be the position of the european parliament .
i sincerely regret any waste of human life and I share your sorrow over the death of orlando zapata .
the same applies to cuba .
we should definitely not take this path .
in 2005 , the council suspended the 2003 measures .
subsequently , there were trips to the island by foreign ministers and commissioners .
there have been no changes or reforms .
nevertheless , political dialogue has been maintained .
the common position has not hindered dialogue .
the supreme sacrifice made by orlando has produced a response in the good consciences of the whole world .
some have said that we absolutely should not talk to cuba because the regime there is unacceptable to us .
the embargo has brought poverty and oppression to the people of cuba , as many different speakers have highlighted .
if they were unable to do this , then a more intelligent embargo should be introduced .
the major democratic states and the eu should , of course , support this .
the immediate release of political prisoners is quite difficult .
and we should also continue meeting civil society .
written statements rule 149 
there are still about 200 political prisoners in cuba .
question time council 
this is an operational task involving exchanging information , analysing risks , research and coordinated joint frontex operations .
el thank you very much for your reply .
that is the effect .
the directive on the protection order against gender violence is also being drawn up .
it needs to become part of the european agenda .
this is the aim of the initiative presented by 12 european union governments .
i wonder if the presidency would look at an experience 20 years ago .
its conclusion was that you need a holistic approach to this issue .
what the commission has done is to initiate a public consultation .
i just have two brief follow up questions .
eur 17 million has been provided for 2010 european year for combating poverty and social exclusion .
this triggered what economists call the automatic stabilisers , which is the social protection provided for in welfare states .
thank you for talking about pensioners .
this has had a devastating effect on european pensioners , driving some of them into poverty and exclusion .
es thank you very much for being here , mr lópez garrido .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together 
these are the two questions as I understand them , madam president .
i think that on this matter , we share the intention of visas being facilitated when this is possible .
the first concerns democracy , the rule of law and human rights .
these are the biggest deficiencies .
my second point concerns energy security .
how , specifically , do things stand in the energy negotiations ?
this would be to enable such people to obtain visas relatively easily .
general negotiations are in progress on visas .
composition of committees and delegations see minutes
closure of the sitting
the seventh framework programme for research provides for eur 886 million per annum for energy research .
that would mean that eur 50 billion would have to be invested .
there is no need for me to read out all the questions .
firstly , the time has come to move from technological roadmaps to the operational implementation of european industrial initiatives .
we should do so step by step , but as quickly as possible .
we should not now lower this ambition .
today you have asked three clear questions and I will respond to them in turn .
these road maps establish concrete objectives as well as the activities needed to achieve them .
we will closely monitor the most promising technologies through the set plan information system .
in order to make this a reality , my group is in favour of three main objectives .
it is not enough to simply regroup and rename the support programmes we already have .
we really have to think about where the money could come from .
why did we allocate zero euro to energy efficiency in the eu recovery package ?
the only way out is to set clear priorities .
i think it is one of the most important challenges , as mentioned in the communication .
when we ask where the money comes from , the commission tells us it comes from wherever it is .
we agree about large tranches of the content , but we have two problems .
what the council has put in place today is a series of platitudes .
that being the case , we should not always be arguing over the details .
we need to reprioritise and redistribute funds within the eu budget .
so the timetable is very tight and meeting that 2015 deadline becomes more and more difficult .
in fact , we know that any form of addiction is an unwelcome phenomenon that must be eradicated .
what is more , there are several powerful arguments why it should be these particular technologies .
ladies and gentlemen , it is time for action .
da madam president , we have reason to be pleased with the set plan .
the set plan is also critical to our attempts to put the social and economic crisis behind us .
madam president , there are two brief points I wish to make .
here agriculture can play a key role in carbon sequestration and can contribute to the 2020 targets .
i would like to look in particular at the use of eu funds .
thank you .
rapid results may be achieved through investments in intelligent cities and in energy efficiency in buildings , especially homes .
this will make it possible to increase this rate in the 2014 2020 period .
thank you .
it is estimated that this will be from eur 7 12 billion .
higher energy prices mean lower growth and higher unemployment , and they cost jobs .
i have only seen one formal study into this question of green jobs .
pt research and technology play a fundamental role in the development of a low carbon society .
the strategic energy technology plan aims to contribute to precisely this goal .
we urgently need to move from words to deeds .
it must do everything it can to achieve these goals .
industrial revolutions in the past have shown that technology can change our way of life permanently .
mountain regions produce almost all of europe's hydroelectric energy .
ro european agriculture is frequently blamed as a major source of global warming .
of course , this perception is not entirely correct .
this topic has certainly been raised already by other speakers .
its further safe development is simply unavoidable .
it would be helpful if we all realised this .
these countries are entitled to cash in on their carbon dioxide quotas .
yet the commission and the 15 original member states want to prevent them from doing so .
in the case of hungary this amounts to several hundred billion forints .
in copenhagen , hungary and poland agreed to use these sums for green infrastructures .
the second is funding we are afraid to talk about ppps , as I have heard this morning .
it is unavoidable , ladies and gentlemen , with the financial resources to which we have to refer .
we discussed the set plan for a long time .
what undertakings are there from the member states ?
these initiatives are also necessary to maintain european competitiveness and create employment .
and where are we today , after that period of reluctant and irresponsible development lacking a proactive approach ?
i shall turn now to the second issue , which is the set plan that we are discussing .
all the estimates presented in the set plan for the financing required are based on technology road maps .
the next issue is the sources of finance and the road maps .
the vote will take place at 12.00 on thursday , 11 march 20written statements rule 149 
i believe that it is important to include , for example , geothermal energy .
effects of the xynthia storm in europe debate 
the next item is the commission statement on the effects of storm xynthia in europe .
after it is received it will be examined by the commission as quickly as possible .
contacts at expert level are well established with the french authorities , thus allowing effective progress .
please be aware , however , that aid from the solidarity fund cannot be paid out immediately .
the solidarity fund should not be misunderstood as an emergency instrument .
as such , a possible grant could be used retroactively for emergency operations from day one of the disaster .
the commission is , however , making every effort to keep this time span as short as possible .
fifty three people died , a dozen people are unaccounted for , and hundreds of people have lost their homes .
this is damage on a significant scale .
i regret that the council is not here to help us with this regulatory amendment .
in any case , rest assured that we need it and that our fellow citizens are expecting it .
however , the courage of madeira's people in overcoming adversity was equally striking .
its natural beauty and the warmth of its people await us .
in any case , the economic and social costs are almost always very significant .
firstly , this compulsive need to link the natural disasters that we are suffering to socalled global warming .
the second is the systematic search for culprits and easy scapegoats .
now is the time to act and parliament is extremely unhappy about this hold up .
however , there is also a second dimension to this issue .
i come from the netherlands .
most of the netherlands is situated below sea level .
for now , it is a case of providing urgent solutions to the populations rocked by these disasters .
in the face of these disasters , the european union must demonstrate its responsiveness and express its solidarity .
thank you .
the fact that that is not possible in the long term has been demonstrated very painfully here again .
the solidarity fund is obsolete and has not taken account of this parliament's resolution of 200it no longer has any value whatsoever .
they are also looking for solidarity from all around the european union solidarity which is fast and efficient .
this proposal concerns mostly the extension of the fund to disasters other than natural ones .
in this context , the cohesion and structural funds should play their role also .
also the rural development fund can be redirected but of course only at the request of the member state .
the debate is closed .
it claimed 53 lives and caused huge material damage , including , in particular , serious flooding .
mr béchu joins me in requesting emergency aid .
today , the financial resources of the solidarity fund seem difficult to implement .
we also need to continue working intensively in the area of prevention .
managing natural disasters is an opportunity for europe to prove its added value .
situation in chile and eu humanitarian aid strategy debate 
the chilean authorities have signalled their acceptance of offers of help made by the european union member states .
an eu civil protection mechanism , a team of six experts , is also now in chile .
the chilean people have shown themselves to be capable of meeting the challenges of a very complex situation .
unfortunately , tragedies continue to happen because of large earthquakes .
it is british , german , french it is in fact money from 27 nation states .
in a time of economic crisis every single one of these nations should be recognised for their worthy efforts .
this has been established within the framework of the joint parliamentary committee .
i would therefore like to mention the european strategy for humanitarian aid .
these have to be rebuilt , and that is where we come in with practical help .
but we are talking about an overall bill of eur 22 billion .
regarding the concrete question of the country strategy for chile and the committed eur 41 million .
terrorism can never be justified , in any way and for any reason .
mr goebbels , it is already after 12.00 .
i think that we can proceed to the vote .
oral explanations of vote
the european union's appeals have so far been met with no response .
sometimes individual sacrifices contribute to historic changes .
i hope this will also be the case this time .
that is our reason for rejecting the amendment .
history will absolve us .
it is totally unacceptable for the european union to curry favour with the communist regime in cuba .
as a result of such measures in poland , instead of creating jobs we would have to close them .
almost 60 people died , and hundreds of thousands of people sustained considerable damage .
we expect it to provide financial aid to the disaster areas by means of the eu solidarity fund .
to call for the common position against cuba to be revoked .
to demand that the criminal us embargo against cuba be lifted immediately .
there are now other political prisoners too in cuba who are in danger .
the tragic circumstances of this death should put us all to shame .
they want to thwart the intentions publicly expressed by the spanish presidency to end the common position on cuba .
i voted against resolution on cuba because I believe it constitutes an act of interference that violates international law .
you can only express effective criticism if you yourself meet the criteria set .
on 29 october 2009 , 187 of the un member states voted to lift the embargo .
three voted for it to remain in place and two abstained .
it is vital to move beyond words to action .
furthermore , roughly two thirds of these jobs will be created in small and medium sized enterprises .
these severely affected several member states and regions .
effective prevention policies must not be overlooked either .
it left more than 60 dead , several disappeared and thousands homeless .
it is our duty to help those who need our aid .
there , too , there are many people missing .
thousands of people have also been left homeless .
in particular , it must be ensured that the union's solidarity fund is mobilised promptly and flexibly .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting see minutes
the case of gilad shalit
the case of shalit is our cause , a european cause .
i am counting on you .
the value of a human person cannot be measured .
as such , he should be given humanitarian treatment and be allowed to communicate .
seven hundred and fifty thousand palestinians have been arrested and put in prison since 196we demand and we hope very sincerely that he will be released .
the ideal scenario for us europeans would be two states coexisting in peace and security .
gilad and his family need our help .
the people of the middle east are the nameless hostages of this never ending conflict .
an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth .
or is there another hope for gilad and all the other victims ?
i would like to ask you to take the first step .
barbaric islamic forces are waging an all out war against western civilisation .
israel is in the frontline of that war .
it is important that we obtain shalit's release , but without israel having to release terrorists in return .
i think this case should be seen and solved exclusively as a human tragedy .
instead it will be in the interests of hamas if they want to gain legitimacy in the peace process .
it is an organisation of israeli and palestinian families who have lost relatives in the conflict .
organisations which want to gain our approval , our respect , must not hold hostages .
indeed this is only way for peace to be achieved in that region .
pl the case of gilad shalit has a particular , personal dimension .
however , let us not pretend that the case does not also have a broader political context .
i am pleased that this resolution has kept to the point .
written statements rule 149 
his abduction alongside the detention of the rest of the prisoners in the area is unacceptable .
i would also like to say that mexico is currently waging a very difficult war against organised drug trafficking .
however , violence against women starts in the home .
over 40 000 soldiers have been involved in the war , and several successes have been achieved .
the perpetrators of these acts committed in may 2006 still enjoy complete impunity .
the european parliament has produced its own report on this .
who were the perpetrators ?
the eu must address the fight against impunity in all its relations with mexico .
fighting impunity is key .
i do not understand this suggestion .
if the president of the country declares war in this area , he should be given complete support .
it should be emphasised that these people should not be made the victims of discrimination .
yes , the situation is complex .
drug trafficking has resulted in acts of violence ending in losses of human life .
the rising consumption by young people is especially worrying .
in this connection , the mexican government established a special prosecutor for crimes committed against journalists in 200indeed , this area constitutes the subject of dedicated cooperation .
the draft policy document was presented to the quintana roo local congress in the aftermath of the seminar .
the debate is closed .
south korea death penalty declared legal
the ruling states that the death penalty is a legal punishment that can deter crime for the public good .
the last time they voted it was seven votes to two .
we also have to note that south korea is de facto an abolitionist country .
i would like to call on all members to support this joint motion for a resolution unanimously .
mr president , the policy of abolishing the death penalty is a very successful part of european foreign policy .
many arguments exist against the use of this means of administering justice .
a critical view should be taken of the south korean court's ruling .
legal status has been thus practically evaluated .
the only difference is that the european monsters do not have to worry about capital punishment .
we have been able to welcome a number of recent positive developments in the fight against the death penalty .
during 2009 burundi , togo and the us state of new mexico all abolished the death penalty .
there is no indication at present that the judgment of the constitutional court will affect this moratorium .
the justice ministry has recently released figures that show more than 60 % support for the death penalty .
so well done south korea go on executing your worst criminals .
south korea death penalty declared legal 
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .
the sitting was closed at 16.30 
signature of acts adopted under codecision see minutes
lapsed written declarations see minutes
transfers of appropriations see minutes
the president cut off the speaker 
if the european parliament censors political comment , it ceases to be a parliament .
i will reply in writing to the letter you sent me .
thursday
we had originally agreed to put it on the agenda on the assumption that everything was in order .
welcome
they are with us at our sitting .
once again , I warmly welcome you all .
preparation for the european council meeting 25 26 march 2010 debate 
it is being done in this way , by coordinating economic policies .
we have challenging tasks ahead of us .
the crisis entails several pressing concerns for communities , workers and businesses across europe .
i will come back to this again later .
europe must not make the mistake of neglecting the imperative of working now to bring about long term change .
the targets which the commission has put on the table were carefully chosen .
of course , the targets must be achievable .
so we cannot accept the principles of interdependence globally and reject them when discussed at european level .
so let us move on from soul searching about copenhagen and take the initiative once again .
we need a clear , unified and ambitious position .
that is why the commission has put forward a communication setting out the steps needed to reinvigorate international negotiations .
at the same time , commissioner hedegaard has started a set of consultations with our key partners .
creating such a mechanism is also a question of responsibility and solidarity .
the world economy needs stability .
this responsibility is that of each member state to guarantee accurate and reliable public accounts .
mr president in office of the council , I invite you to take initiatives along these lines .
applause 
that is not the objective .
it is the commission that must propose how we can achieve a sensible stabilisation within the euro area .
moreover , I am astonished that chancellor merkel is bringing the international monetary fund into play .
that is why solidarity with greece is an act to stabilise the euro in the euro area .
that is my feeling today .
europe must intervene to ensure that greece's consolidation measures are worthwhile .
as I have said , the greek people deserve much better .
otherwise , as mr münchau wrote today , before long , chancellor merkel will be returning defeated from brussels .
the debate on the eu 2020 economic strategy is naturally already on the agenda .
i hope that this attitude will not prevail among the majority of the heads of government .
the speaker was interrupted by a heckler 
i realise that .
we have achieved the single european market .
that is why you also see me with the euro sceptics .
hu those who spoke before me all mentioned the solution to the greek crisis .
of course , it is not just greece that found itself in a difficult situation in 2008 200an imf loan was accepted there , a move that has extremely serious consequences for the population .
we need to face the question of what the lessons of the financial crisis are .
it is a recipe for disaster .
if implemented as it stands , europe 2020 will be another lisbon strategy a failure .
europe should instead dare to attack these challenges head on with bold governance proposals .
firstly , the open coordination method is not working and must be abandoned .
an open process would create transparency and permit citizen involvement .
as european politicians , we should always strive to put the citizens at the centre of our policy .
thank you .
el madam president , I think we have dealt sufficiently and fairly with the issue of greece .
i should like to touch on an issue that also concerns other countries .
i should like to make two proposals 
we gave billions to the banks in a bid to get the banks rolling .
i am sorry but I wish to say that one minute is not long enough to present a view .
that is the right path to take .
chancellor kohl would have saidlet's solve this problem together with greece.
chancellor merkel takes flight and says well , what does the treaty say ?
we need a carrot and stick approach .
green jobs lie at the heart of the eu 2020 strategy .
we are , certainly , able to help safeguard the common market from protectionism .
better legislation is , of course , a particular responsibility of this very house , of this parliament .
by bringing in harmonisation in these areas , we are only maintaining the ills of the european social model .
after all , as mrs ek also said , a free for all is not the way to success .
mrs merkel also appears to be pushing things in that direction .
this is the prospect that awaits other countries which may apply such measures under such pressure .
yes , there is the treaty , the letter and the spirit .
that is why we have to be creative that is why we have to show solidarity .
that is up to the heads of governments to do this week .
no , she did not understand it at all .
please fight for a financial transactions tax .
stay strong and create european instruments !
that is why I am in favour of this major , strong currency .
of course , we have been talking about this for a long time .
ro the council of the european union enthusiastically welcomed the commission's europe 2020 communication .
today , the debate revolves around greece tomorrow it will probably concern another member state .
both are needed when you belong to a family such as a euro area .
greece is not the only country in emu facing serious problems .
it is not , nor will it remain , the only target of speculators .
the crisis , any crisis is the mother of change .
we should not be talking about how we are making germany less competitive .
madam president , I would like to make the point that you could not make this up today .
it is rapidly failing .
we have already seen the good people of germany saying that they are not happy with the situation .
it is their case .
it is a self centred opinion for those other member states , looking after themselves .
greece is the problem at the moment .
i feel it will go from greece to spain and then portugal and italy and so on .
the euro is not a solution to the economic problems of the world .
it is the problem .
this should be a warning to countries outside the eurozone .
my three proposals concern greece's recovery plan .
my second proposal concerns finance , since we do not have the instruments .
it is not only in greece that accounts are flawed .
the time has come for a decision .
i was listening very carefully to the calls for better governance .
thirdly , europe has economic and financial stability .
these three european characteristics are clearly implied in the greece issue .
moreover , we are going to look further ahead .
the elements of creating incentives with the structural funds were not in the lisbon strategy .
it is also working closely with the commission and parliament .
this is leading the european union according to the community method .
the eu has credibility and liquidity .
this is a time that requires solidarity between the member states and europe's institutions .
the economic and financial crisis , and greece , require european action .
we also sayyesto loaning money where the reform programme would otherwise be threatened .
greece is an example that europe must learn from .
by 2020 , a single and secure european e services area should be created .
coordinated regulatory intervention is required in order to protect the common currency against speculation .
it is demanding that the short supplies of greek citizens should not vanish into the pockets of international speculators .
the european union must retain its global competitiveness .
the citizensinitiative is a very clear priority for the presidency of the council .
very clear .
that is why , mr president , we have considered the citizensinitiative to be a priority .
participation by citizens , therefore , and issues dealt with at european level .
on behalf of my group , mr šefčovič , I would ask that it contain at least three ideas .
in other words , do not let us make things complicated .
i will give you an example of this that I saw on the internet .
it is direct public access to parliament that justly strengthens its legitimacy .
it strengthens the notion of citizenship , which is at the very root of the european project .
be flexible , please !
make access to this initiative easy , but let us make it clear as well and not disappoint expectations .
the commission will then , in its wisdom , decide whether it does anything or not .
as far as relates to the citizens , there are hardly any europe wide debates at all .
there is , therefore , one very particular point that I would like to bring up .
due to the time constraints , I cannot now go into any other points .
however , as the european parliament , we can also do something to take the citizensinitiative seriously .
the second topic is the admissibility of the initiative .
again , every aspect must be examined carefully in order to find the best way to go .
i think the european parliament's role should be much greater , here .
who , therefore , will be responsible for financing citizensinitiatives ?
this legislation must be citizen friendly and it must be highly visible .
there must also be easily accessible assistance and help given to citizens who wish to organise a petition .
the citizensinitiative is like a newborn baby .
it has unlimited potential but it must be handled with care when it takes its first tentative steps .
active citizens are awaiting the result they are waiting to see what form we give to the initiative .
it is a new opportunity for european citizens to have a greater say in the decision making process .
that is what we must always bear in mind .
it is these kinds of obstacles that we must avoid in the case of the citizensinitiative .
we hope that there will be a finished proposal by the summer .
there should also be support for the initiatives , for example , with translations .
sk commissioner , thank you for providing an outline of the next steps .
the citizensinitiative shows the citizens of the eu a further means of european integration .
if you do not mind , I will switch to dutch to explain why I am so happy !
in other words , it is a form of direct democracy which complements parliamentary representation .
this principle finds specific expression in the citizensinitiative in article 11 4 .
generally speaking , it is a fact that democracy is today taking a backwards step .
we now have a right of initiative for the citizens .
it would be my wish that we should also have this in europe .
for this reason , I eagerly await an appropriate regulation from the commission .
so perhaps we should be grateful to the eu for introducing this .
mass migration has made this difficult to achieve .
another important way of exercising and consolidating democracy is the use of referendums .
i wish to welcome the commission's initiative in launching a broad public consultation on the regulation online .
mr kamall is not here .
as mr kastler also said , this initiative must be applied .
we all agree on practicality .
i can assure you that there are no easy answers to these questions and to these slightly contradictory requests .
i think that strong and wide public consultations are taking place through the smart legislating proposals .
this is the only way that the eu will successfully move closer to its citizens and become more democratic .
those votes reflected a noticeable lack of communication between the european union and its citizens .
situation in tibet debate 
we respect theone chinapolicy .
for the eu , tibet is a human rights issue .
we welcome that the tibetan side has reiterated its firm commitment not to seek separation or independence .
they did not even listen to what mrs andrikienwas saying .
there must be no repeat of this .
it would appear that china does not want anything from the talks .
we cannot accept cultural genocide of this sort .
if the european union is not bold enough to defend tibet , not many others will .
reference was also made here to the fact that we need a special representative for tibet .
tibetans are forbidden from doing anything to rescue their own culture , identity and religion .
today , the 21st meeting of the tibetan task force for sino tibetan negotiations begins in dharamsala .
it would be good if the commission , ms catherine ashton and the council thought this through .
we also need a conception and mediation .
it is not enough to offer minority rights in the form of purely folkloristic performances for foreign tourists .
ro mr kaczmarek spoke earlier about the protests in 200national security cannot be used as grounds for abolishing fundamental civil rights .
we have seen it in the past where chinese communist leaders try to intimidate eu member states individually .
i believe that this issue must be dealt with during summit meetings .
i was under the impression that they are willing for this .
sadly , this is not the case .
this can be prevented only by granting them a genuine autonomous status .
china can become truly great only by showing respect towards its minorities .
a hypocrite who is dependent on something on those cheap goods from china .
the president cut off the speaker 
we are likewise unable to put pressure on china through millions in development aid .
i therefore expect the high representative .
sl I am one of the few who recently had an opportunity to visit tibet .
however , there is some progress under way in tibet .
moreover , our discussion has underlined the necessity for both parties to promptly resume dialogues .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 149 
the results of these efforts are still not satisfactory .
the media , today , are full of information about china .
however , can his strategy be successful ?
economic interests cannot be made a reason to forget the persecuted and the suffering .
since that time , tibetans have not been allowed to commemorate that day freely .
in eastern europe , where I come from , the story is a familiar one .
we had more than 74 requests to speak under this item .
this was the only possible way to enable the debate to proceed in an orderly manner .
we all know how sudan has suffered under his rule of violence .
he said that if they interfere in sudan's affairs , he would cut their fingers off .
i should like to know which measures the president is going to take with regard to this extension .
mr zuev was killed about a week ago in kaliningrad .
this is not the first case of a journalist being killed in russia .
in our dialogue with russia , we should always draw attention to this .
as a result , apart from the financial crisis , we also have a moral crisis .
the president noted that there was a problem with the microphone 
it has worn down the resistance of greek society and the economic strength of the greeks .
as I said , its problem is mainly political .
apart from sanctions , there was also a result .
very early on , franco spanish cooperation proved to be a model of its kind within the european union .
only 38 % of current rail capacity is used .
they will not flinch .
take the small town of congleton , for example , which is a local semi rural community .
you see , this is the genius of the eu it is always one person removed .
recent studies have shown that this kind of violence always precedes acts of physical violence .
we are fighting with all the workers to create .
for this reason , I ask the commission to remedy this irregular situation .
after all , staffing in all the union's institutions is managed according to this principle .
the perpetrators are either acquitted or sometimes charges are not even brought against them .
madam president , the european parliament should take decisive action to stop the anti hungarian terrorism in serbia .
in europe , they account for 30 % of researchers and only 18 % of professors .
when the citizens of the union write to the commission , their letters must not go unanswered .
the treaty of lisbon gives parliament additional powers in the area of the budget .
the budget for 2011 is the fifth budget in the multiannual financial framework .
the margins are very small .
what is significant is that it also establishes the european external action service .
member of the commission . mr president , I am in a listening mood this evening .
what has been already agreed are some transitional period arrangements agreed at the november conciliation .
after all , choices relating to poverty reduction must never be dependent on our diplomatic interests .
we believe and recommend that parliament should abandon a budgetary model that is purely incremental .
however , these guidelines are also a very realistic first step .
on behalf of the alde group . mr president , I would like to stress three points .
indeed , those priorities leave much to be desired .
by diverting erasmus funds to students , or by creating a new programme with fresh money ?
many of them are fairly well educated .
they only lack job opportunities .
no proposal for an increase in the budget should be tolerated .
i would like to concentrate on two aspects .
investment in youth means thinking today about the europe of tomorrow .
what is our problem ? our big problem is that this is an extremely inflexible budget .
the rapporteur has produced a balanced proposal .
i would like to speak for a few more minutes about the cohesion policy .
the cohesion policy is not a form of do goodism .
the committee on budgets is very keen to see that we get value for our money .
thank you for your respectful attention .
the initial report was perhaps understandably vague and general .
the guidelines for the 2011 budget also include the european parliament's own budget .
this is not the case at present , which is not what I would call transparent .
i call on my fellow members to support these proposals .
i have a substantive question regarding the priority the rapporteur gives to youth .
as a rule , social and youth affairs can be handled very well by member states .
yet I would draw attention to one issue where eu support is truly indispensable .
the report mentions young people's transition from education to the labour market .
spending someone else's without their permission is not budgeting , it is theft .
to them , it is a matter of life or death .
firstly , we need to make it clear that climate change is still a major priority .
we recently discussed the new external action service , for example , which will certainly require extra resources .
however , the question of how much it will cost is of key importance for us .
we cannot have administration of multiannual programmes outside the commission .
i think we need the courage to make big decisions .
i would like to say three things about the eu budget .
for example , we could shut down a large number of the eu's agencies .
the money should be given , or given back , to where it comes from , namely the taxpayers .
i think we need courage .
however , time is also needed for this mechanism to begin to work .
there is no doubt that for parliament to perform its duties effectively , it needs the appropriate means .
europe is still behind in the technology race with the usa , japan and other new world powers .
we should develop programmes such as those which make milk and fruit available at schools .
it needs to be environmentally friendly , energy efficient and particularly cost effective .
even municipal politicians like the mayor , freddy thielemans , admit this .
many of you said something which I agree with that young people are the european union's future .
once again , I would like to thank you for your attention .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
this project will only have a chance of success if we provide the necessary funding for it .
parliament must engage in an open discussion about the expenditure ceiling in heading 5 for 20work on the 2011 budget is under way .
this last point is vitally important if we want to protect against the counterfeiting of our high quality products .
that is my intention , in any case .
we naturally hope he will listen to parliament's voice , which will be reflected tomorrow in the vote .
before concluding , I shall take the liberty of making one final point , which concerns labelling .
the second point is the question of the place of origin .
occasionally , this causes concern , most recently in the case of tokaj wine .
there is much in it that is to be commended .
we cannot support paragraph 19 , the so calledwonky fruitparagraph .
it is surely a decision for consumers .
i and others believe that our consumers want to know where their food comes from .
i think that is more to do with the ambitions of this building rather than what our consumers want .
these instruments have proven popular with consumers and producers alike .
however , I agree with the rapporteur that their management and application must be simplified .
i wholeheartedly supported this move and now we can let the market set its own standards .
madam president , thank you for the opportunity to speak on this very important point .
i like many colleagues in this chamber would be against an eu logo .
i feel it would be largely meaningless and would not be helpful to consumers .
therefore , I want any labelling system to create a level playing field .
we also need to raise the general awareness of consumers in this regard .
however , we also need thetraditional speciality guaranteedandorganic farmingindications .
our businesses need to gain market recognition of the distinctive and quality related aspects associated with their products .
regulations must be honestly implemented to a common standard .
i believe that we take the same approach to these quality products .
moreover , almost all of our committee voted in favour of an amendment along these lines .
let us together interpret this amendment as a call to find a new middle way .
where a product comes from is important .
local specialities are of immeasurable value .
if we remember this , we will have an excellent future , with safe and pure food originating here .
unfortunately , not all consumers are aware of this .
i would seriously warn against overregulation here .
the demands of the market are diverse and are increasing all the time .
faced with these new commercial challenges , the european farmer's main asset is quality .
that is why efforts are being made to safeguard them , including with labelling .
against this backdrop , the scottà report is welcome , as is the package announced by commissioner cioloş .
an agricultural product quality policy and a reduction in the european agriculture budget are two incompatible ideas .
quality logos should , in principle , be viewed as beneficial if they are voluntary .
this robs producers and processors of their entrepreneurial freedom and also narrows the choice for consumers .
as was rightly emphasised in the report , this has to change .
de madam president , the control of foodstuffs is a utopian fantasy .
in the case of health risks , authorities should put out warnings , but they are not obliged to .
quality conscious customers are prepared to pay more for high quality foods .
you are right about that .
however , producers want and need these rules .
we should take that into account in our debate and also in the vote tomorrow .
it is important that information on the quality of goods reaches the consumer .
consumers must know what they are buying and for what they are paying .
in my view , a protected designation of origin and geographical indication system must be implemented .
it is therefore not my intention to merge for the sake of it .
this would result in nearly 1.5 billion working poor worldwide .
this is all very welcome .
this unprecedented meeting will take place in washington dc on 20 and 21 april .
i am going to speak on behalf of us both .
it is not enough to regulate financial products we must get to the very bottom of the wrongdoing .
a dangerous game is being played between ministers for finance and ministers for employment and social affairs .
the commission praises our fiscal discipline but we are haemorrhaging jobs .
we are balancing the books but our workers are paying the price .
around the world , this goes hand in hand with extremism , which poses a long term threat as well .
work has been done in those other countries , so why are we not learning from them ?
we must make sure the core ilo conventions are actually implemented .
we must make sure the un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities is implemented .
the voice of europe needs to be heard loud and strong there .
we urgently need to be able to safeguard decent work for the citizens of europe .
we are close to forgetting the obvious that work is a lever for growth .
social progress is a prerequisite for ending the economic crisis , not the other way around .
unfortunately , a failure to recognise this reality is evident in the current eu 2020 strategy .
this is simply unacceptable and requires action by all concerned sectors and stakeholders .
in 2000 , tuberculosis was included in the list of priority diseases under eu wide surveillance .
however , the commission cannot succeed in this challenge alone .
tuberculosis is the seventh most common cause of death in the world .
globally , there were 9.4 million new cases of tuberculosis in 2008 and 1.8 million deaths .
ultimately , we are the european union and our strength lies in unity .
furthermore , the multiple resistant strains offer little hope of an end to this scourge in the short term .
when it comes to financing the measures , it is advisable to distinguish between two scenarios .
strengthening the role of clinical and scientific research is vital in the fight against tuberculosis .
the debate is closed .
economic growth , which will be much lower in 2009 than in previous years , has been damaged .
trade has decreased , which will weaken these countriescurrent account balances .
direct investment needs to be encouraged .
the cost of money transfers made by emigrants from the countries they work in must be reduced .
sv mr president , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his important report .
in a few daystime , the acp eu joint parliamentary assembly will meet in tenerife .
the eu has shown leadership says the commissioner , but we can do much better .
we must give the developing countries the chance to emerge from the crisis under their own steam .
the vote will take place on thursday , 25 march 20written statements rule 149 
this makes us aware that the problem of terrorism in europe has not yet been solved .
we join today with those heroic women , and we are thinking about them and their difficult situation .
the financial and economic crisis has seen the worst global economic decline since the 1930s .
most member states are experiencing rising budgetary deficits and debts .
the primary function of the ecb is to maintain price stability .
however , I will leave it to my colleagues here perhaps to amplify on this .
the ecb is accountable to the citizens of europe through the european parliament .
we must strengthen that accountability .
secondly , the structural dependency of the euro area on finite resources must be brought to an end .
first , on the economic developments and monetary policy over the past year .
i therefore welcome the repeated support by the committee on economic and monetary affairs for our quarterly monetary dialogue .
the litmus test for a constructive role is that finance serves the real economy .
thus far , a great deal of attention has been focused on the banking sector .
within europe's economic and monetary union , there is a clear allocation of responsibilities .
policy makers at the national level must keep public finances sound and their economies competitive .
it is a union of shared destiny .
the speaker added in french and german we share a destiny in common .
let me conclude .
it has shielded our citizens from economic turbulences .
the greek crisis has demonstrated the need for enhanced economic governance .
this was already recognised and the legal base provided in the lisbon treaty .
this has been used in the past , probably too rarely .
that is the second core element of reinforced economic governance .
we must do our utmost to clear the sky and bring back growth .
therefore , this is indeed no time for business as usual .
the euro area has therefore become more attractive , as the case of iceland shows .
let us be austere , but let us also be inventive .
what does that mean ?
so I believe that europe is now at a critical juncture .
we spend too much time coordinating , too little time acting together .
however , the euro does not sit in isolation .
the uk perspective has a lot to say on differences in fiscal policy .
fundamentally , money to fund the public sector does not magically appear .
it comes from tax receipts from the private sector .
hence , it is now in a strong position for recovery .
now it is the turn of the private sector to replenish the coffers .
on the one hand , we are talking about a community with a common destiny .
the euro cannot provide the answer to the different levels of productivity in the individual economies .
the president cut off the speaker 
on 25 march 1957 , the european union was born under the treaty of rome .
on 25 march 1821 , greece was born .
many people will say it serves greece right and it should pay for its mistakes .
thank you , sir .
your time has run out .
mr scicluna's report reflects this approach .
but there are indicators beyond the stability and growth pact that need respecting too .
so we know the lesson exerting discipline in times of surplus is even harder than policing deficit .
it identifies elements of social cohesion which are not present in similar debates in the european parliament .
that is clear from the various things being said in greece , much of which is inaccurate .
these days , the imf is the right organisation to help greece out of the crisis .
mr president , let us try and learn from this situation .
it has channelled over eur 1 trillion to the banks and monopoly groups .
let us bring it all down to earth just a little bit shall we ?
unemployment , youth unemployment in the iberian peninsula and many eurozone countries is chronic .
nothing to do with the crisis at all .
a complete disaster .
gdp per capita in the usa is miles ahead of the european union .
gdp in the pacific rim is miles ahead of the gdp in the union .
no , the euro has not been successful at all .
there is no coordinated fiscal policy so it is doomed to failure and it is failing as we speak .
it is not under control the mafia needs to be , but under the ground .
we need a more automated system .
we do not need economic governance under the control of finance ministers .
i would like to make two remarks about what mr trichet has said on the euro area .
that is not sufficient .
it is important not to underestimate the work involved .
we share a common destiny , as mr trichet so rightly said .
only two are in euroland .
greece is currently going through a crisis because it entered that oasis of stability too soon .
the signs were there .
it is really up to the council now to make a move .
i have repeated it in spanish , which is one of the european union's global languages .
in many ways , ireland is ahead of many other countries in its fiscal adjustment .
we have to ask whether some states should have entered the euro area as early as they did .
european taxpayers in many countries may , today , pay a great deal for this haste .
it is true that many are demanding economic governance .
estonia is practically the only eu member state that currently satisfies the maastricht criteria .
thank you .
i agree that 2008 was instrumental and that those responsible have risen to this occasion .
this is the magic panacea that we need .
the second pillar which cannot be overlooked and which we cannot do without is the matter of fiscal harmonisation .
we just have to observe strict budget discipline in public finances .
in many countries , cuts in public expenditure are needed .
a good first step would be to begin to publish the minutes of the ecb council meetings .
openness should also be a key principle in the establishment of the european systemic risk board esrb .
but for how much longer ?
beyond emergencies , let us finally give the euro the instruments it needs .
we must welcome them with enthusiasm , not with petty mindedness .
contriving to exclude euro area members amounts to abandoning the ambition of a strong europe in the world .
let us think about how this illness , which we call the crisis , arose .
some member states behaved like children , hiding their misdeeds .
european union solidarity obliges us also to support the countries which have been worst hit by the crisis .
mr rehn , you have made some very encouraging statements over the last few days .
we should do everything possible to continue on the path that you have taken .
the euro is a stabilising force , even in times of crisis .
there can be no reform without the euro .
greece cannot be given subsidies , but it wants support for implementing its reform and savings plan .
this is what we are calling on the member states to do and we expect them to show commitment .
i would like to draw attention to one aspect of it .
parliament must help the commission and the ecb in their efforts in order to avoid failure in this endeavour .
this is , however , a strategic question , in which the council's committed support is indispensable .
however , keeping our own currency is only part of the answer .
the single currency has not provided a solution to all the internal and external imbalances which have occurred .
those groups which are not responsible for the crisis must not now be made to bear the cost .
if we do not invest in people , we will not have a future in europe .
this is why I am calling for the emphasis to be put on the social aspect in future .
we have to remain extremely alert .
let me only say that greece has a role model , and the role model is ireland .
they must draw consequences from this nationally .
i have listened to your views very carefully .
there are two lines of action in reinforcing economic governance which are of the essence .
however the tensions in the euro area are not new and are well known .
of course , they must be couched in line with european social cohesion principles .
some can be executed in the short term and others in the medium term .
in writing . there are lessons to be learnt from the current eurozone crisis .
better coordination would enhance euro area stability .
there is a general agreement that the economic crisis was a logical outcome of a widespread crisis of values .
almost all european economies have sinned against the principles of sound and balanced fiscal policy .
the first cause of this justified criticism is the objectives of the bank .
from the moment when an economic crisis erupts , however , it is a very different story .
on the contrary , it will further exacerbate them .
consequently , it believes that I can no longer cite prejudice .
the fact remains that it is ordering our parliament to pay two thirds of the legal costs .
this decision therefore constitutes a scathing rejection of the partisan tactics that deprived me of parliamentary immunity .

we have two amendments , one of which is an amendment to the amendment .

we cannot open a debate on that now , mr busuttil .
you have the floor , but we cannot open a debate .
welcome
we warmly welcome mr tabarki and the members of his delegation .
we therefore wish you an enjoyable and fruitful visit .
now it is all clear .
parliament accepted the oral amendment 
before the vote on paragraph 22 
it is possible to request split votes , in accordance with the procedure that the groups themselves sought .
at any rate , everything can be revised .
voting time continued 
forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting see minutes
that is a fact .
their values and norms are directly at odds with our own .
however , this parliament is calling for even more so called decentralised agencies .
i repeat that , as I see it , we have too many of these already .
there are some that should be abolished before we go creating a new one .
next year's budget must not be drawn up as if these were ordinary times .
why ?
there should be a clear divide .
it also supports the introduction of comprehensive and compulsory legislation forplace of farminglabelling .
just so long as this is not being used as an excuse to override the choices of the consumer .
it is poor people and poor countries that are suffering the most as a result of the economic crisis .
it is a matter for national governments to legislate .
nl mr president , as parliament , we ought to think twice before making proposals .
we ought to be making proposals for policies that will solve problems , not exacerbate them .
i will be very brief with my second point .
he says why tempt ye me , ye hypocrites ?
show me the tribute money.
and they brought unto him a penny .
they say unto him caesar's.
it is an irrelevant report .
da mr president , we in the danish people's party voted against this report .
this will involve the united kingdom being given a legal obligation to allow imports from these countries .
as a result of this pairing of good and bad proposals , we decided to abstain .
in writing . I votedyesat the final vote on this resolution .
we greens agree with the procedure .
this has been leading to redundancies there too , exacerbating the region's social situation .
given this , I see no reason to vote against the mobilisation of the fund in this case .
the sums are not big for the eu but they will alleviate the hardships lithuanian workers are facing .
we must therefore vote for the fund to be used appropriately for other member states .
i voted for the 2009 annual statement on the euro area and public finances .
the consolidation of public finances is a vital prerequisite for ensuring sustainable economic growth .
the irish labour party does not support the introduction of ccctb .
we only need to carry out that process rationally .
mr constâncio has an impressive cv .
we would so very much like to believe him .
objections by anyone who does not wish to see the appointment in question take place are understandable .
this would be a recipe for the politics of diminished responsibility .
mr fazakas hid his past and lied when asked about it .
this lack of honesty should not be rewarded .
there are many issues of interest at global level .
it is therefore important to attempt to reach agreement between developed and developing countries on speeding up progress .
in addition , another crucial question is assistance in maintaining order and in rebuilding a disaster hit country .
it is true that it promotes the non proliferation of nuclear weapons and the control of all weapons .
reform of the development cooperation system , which is covered in the report , must also be supported .
in romania , according to some estimates , the roma minority amounts to more than 2 million .
this fact may also be the reason that all the national social inclusion programmes have completely failed .
we are also guaranteeing a society that is more fair , more creative and more dynamic .
it is important to adopt a common position on structural and pre accession funding policy .
the eu has been supporting the member states in their efforts to implement effective policies .
it is for these reasons that I abstained on the resolution , and dissented from my political group .
today , we are talking about the 10 or 12 million roma in the eu .
when will there finally be a policy that serves europeans first ?
simply pumping money into the roma settlements will not do any good , as past experience has shown .
in recent years , this has been changing .
measures taken to combat discrimination against the roma continue to be insufficient .
this has affected many of the 10 12 million representatives of the roma community in the european union .
however , the procedural and content aspects involved have , unfortunately , made it difficult to utilise this opportunity .
however , this resolution imposed rules and guidelines that would impede this function .
in this draft decision , the council exceeds its executive powers .
facilities such as this should not be set in motion .
according to mrs malmström's own words , this is an initiative with great political significance and practical implications .
i voted in favour of this report on the priorities for budget 20support should be given to programmes that help young people who are starting a new business .
we swedish social democrats chose today to vote in favour of the priorities for the 2011 budget .
however , to be quite honest , this should have been a constant concern over the years .
young people are at the heart of european social and inclusion strategies .
i did , of course , vote in favour .
this budget introduces long term guidelines for building policy , which could lead to reduced costs in the future .
additionally , rigour and transparency must be ensured in managing the funds made available to the various institutions .
the treaty of lisbon has given parliament new responsibilities .
explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with rule 170 of the rules of procedure 
it is there to serve producers and consumers .
in writing . I would like to commend my colleagues in the agricultural committee for this initiative report .
it will help customers and small businesses alike .
the proposal for aplace of farminglabel will indicate where the raw materials come from .
the traditional speciality guaranteed and organic farming schemes must also be retained .
i voted for the report because I support better protection for european products globally .
the subject of quantitative production management has been deliberately swept under the carpet in the commission's communication .
this applies not only to milk production , but also to wine growing in particular .
the quality of european agricultural products constitutes a piece of heritage that is respected worldwide .
that is why I voted in favour .
citizens have the right to protection .
for this reason , I have voted in favour of the report .
i am in favour of labelling all primary agricultural products with the place of production .
for this reason , we must protect them .
in writing . sv the eu should have strong consumer protection .
however , I voted against the report on agricultural product quality policy what strategy to follow ? .
the main reason for this is that the report violates the principle of subsidiarity .
i voted for this report , since we must help developing countries , particularly during this difficult economic period .
i call for additional funds to be earmarked for developing countries .
i support this report's calls for a sustained increase in development aid .
this text supports the implacable logic of liberal dogmatism .
it is therefore harmful .
i voted against .
also , the decision regarding the so called right to sexual and reproductive health .
the most serious financial and economic crisis since the 1930s has hit europe hard .
these measures should be correlated with action to end tax havens .
all these paragraphs were adopted by comfortable majority .
the exception to this , greece , came about due to systemic errors compounded over time and kept hidden .
i voted against the ecb report for 200however , the report continues to defend the ecb and its guidelines , even making major contradictions .
in writing . I and my labour colleagues strongly support the work of the rapporteur edward scicluna .
like the vast majority of this house , I voted in favour of this report .
the ecb annual report 2008 reflects the causes and circumstances of the crisis well .
the ecb had to tackle a crisis which had hit the european economy severely .
rising budget deficits in member states combined with growing debt are the primary macro economic consequences of the crisis .
the ecb adopted a different strategy for the crisis than other leading central banks around the world .
we are still waiting for the results of these actions .
europe is coming out of the crisis , but the situation is still uncertain .

ten days ago in moscow , more people died at the hands of terrorists .
last friday , it was broadcast for the first time on russian public television .
the minutes have been approved .
i think it is only right that we remember those victims too .
this is why I mentioned it .
those measures were requested by the informal european council of 11 february .
that is why it created a task force under my authority .
the greek case highlighted the limitations of the current fiscal surveillance mechanism in the euro area .
we must explore all possible ways to reinforce fiscal discipline and propose a framework for crisis resolution .
without more economic convergence , we will jeopardise the common currency and the common market .
budgetary discipline is not sufficient .
let me make it very clear that there is no divergence here in what we are seeking to achieve .
the european council is neither the executive nor the legislative power of the union .
that is true and there is no intention whatsoever to change that fact .
it will be the result of our efforts , not an instrument .
i had hoped that my start as permanent president of the european council would have been easier .
in particular the commission ensured that any mechanism should be placed in a community context .
this is what we needed and this is what we have got .
the right arrangements have been made to involve the imf , within the framework of the euro area .
the commission is confident that a consensus can be built around it between now and june .
what about children ?
europe 2020 is not about one level acting at the expense of the other .
it is about making all levels work well and together as a whole .
what we now need is to be determined and consistent .
as you know my colleague commissioner connie hedegaard has already embarked on a programme of outreach .
the only things that matter to our citizens are the results .
this will be crucial to resolving the crisis .
let us look , primarily , at greece .
the situation with europe 2020 is similar .
we were not exactly thrilled , because we felt that several elements were missing .
applause 
at the same time , the greek government naturally has to stop its internal struggles .
only the european commission can do this .
the council cannot do it not even the president of the council .
we need that fund as fast as possible , in order to increase the effectiveness of the stability pact .
it is not through the open coordination method that we will fulfil our goals .
applause 
mr verhofstadt , I am happy to accept your call for more work on europe 20so far , after all , three groups in this house have worked exclusively on this .
such a centralisation of power in brussels is not the solution and would not be acceptable .
we do not support all aspects of the initiative .
economic policy coordination is to be built on the failed principles of the stability and growth pact .
i regard that as a dubious procedure .
otherwise , I fear the worst .
just look at the disastrous , ruinous common fisheries policy .
what really matters is the loss of democracy .
you have not been elected .
you are not accountable and there is no mechanism for the peoples of europe to remove you .
nl mr president .
this debate is a big sham .
let us not forget that greece has been deceiving the countries of europe with falsified figures for many years .
mr van rompuy , you say that you have forced greece to take tough measures .
tough measures an increase in the retirement age from 61 to 63 years ?
greek workers are taking retirement at 63 and we have to foot the bill .
now the greeks , with their falsified figures , are already receiving financial support , and who is next ?
mr van baalen , why are you not contradicting mr verhofstadt ?
some people are arguing for sanctions , penalties and a show of toughness .
we asked greece to take some measures .
it has taken them it has shouldered its responsibilities .
it is convinced of that .
history never repeats itself and certainly not in the same way .
we must learn every lesson there is to learn from the crisis that we have experienced .
we must draw every consequence there is to draw from it .
that responsibility is incumbent on the eu .
to each , their own responsibility .
we will , therefore , think about all of that .
there is also the whole problem of financial regulation , of which some people have rightly reminded us .
the crisis is still not quite over , but the recession is over .
we have decided on an economic strategy with five objectives not sixty , but five .
applause 
we in the eu can only do so much .
i am sure that we will have a very fruitful debate on those proposals very soon .
it is no longer enough to set objectives we need to define instruments .
what we need are open , binding targets and carrots and sticks for states to implement what is decided .
why be so afraid of growth ?
we need economic growth and we need it spelt out in the conclusions of europe 20one thing that is immediately needed is energy efficiency .
the plan failed .
the markets you refer to prefer the international monetary fund as the supervisor of greece and other european economies .
there is a need here for clarification and , above all , complete transparency .
that is why independence is so very important in politics .
if he cannot come , then perhaps his vice president , joe biden , can .
generally , it was a presentation of the position of the european parliament .
i spoke for about 15 20 minutes on the most important points .
fr mr president , president of the european council , I have four comments .
new tools therefore have to be invented this is how you must approach the mandate .
that is the issue at stake in the debate and in the mandate that you have today .
they have sunk almost without trace in this communiqué .
why are we not focusing on things that we can actually get a grip on ?
we have a framework of rules in place .
however , I once again agree with my friend mrs berès how about some competition between our institutions ?
we have mr monti's report coming , and there will be a report from my committee .
however , economic union would possibly mean doing away with different political views and different political factions .
the european union should take appropriate steps here .
in one way , I think that we have taken a step forwards .
you have indeed achieved results in the areas of labour market and research and development .
to your credit , you have always played your role with both modesty and ambition .
the criteria when it comes to money are clear .
my second point concerns europe 20europe 2020 is not an objective .
othmar karas is , of course , from austria , but he was talking on behalf of herbert reul .
there is a high risk that the financial and real economic crisis might turn into a public debt crisis .
the regional and local levels of european governance are important co owners of europe's future .
they are also able to translate common european goals into their own territorial growth and job strategies .
as you know , the greek government has denied these rumours .
they do not feature in the agreement that the council reached in december .
or a different question how will parliament's stance be taken into account in that case ?
ga I would like him to speak a little about this crisis .
the commission needs to clarify the flow of information with greece .
the comission must clearly indicate where institutional and personal responsibility rests .
someone is accountable and must be made accountable .
this is an issue which is different from supporting greece .
the commission will do its utmost to enforce them even better in the future .
we would like to do this in a complementary way , so that each level supports the others .
that is exactly what we would like to achieve .
there are just a few points that I wish to stress .
that is a worthy argument , but we must work within the framework of the treaty of lisbon .
he did not , I repeat once again , request financial assistance .
he hopes that once the results of his efforts are visible , the spreads will decrease .
therefore , it is certainly not a government in the constitutional sense of the word .
should we discuss this within the task force ?
a major protectionist movement has certainly been avoided in europe .
we must develop it further , but it is not an end in itself .
it is an instrument , but an important one .
just as there is the common currency , there is the common market .
nl since mrs van brempt asked me this question , I should like to reply in dutch .
to reiterate , I by no means feel the need to turn up for a resit in june .
this is a very important discussion for all of us .
the conditions for increasing investments in research and innovation must be improved .
their functioning today , however , is still marked by contradiction .
abuses are damaging in particular to those actors who are making true efforts to mitigate environmental damage .
in addition , we need to create full legal harmony between international and eu climate protection regulations .
with this in mind , we must all make efforts .
greece is not the only state in the euro area facing financial problems .
this is not only an economic problem , but is also a violation of human rights .
we need a long term strategy for fighting poverty as an integral part of eu policy .
the biggest challenge the eu is currently facing is the dramatic rise in unemployment .
the eu also needs to invest in health care , agriculture , and transport and energy infrastructures .
thank you .
only half a year later , the greek crisis has put the eu before a dramatic situation .
if so , how ?

i would like to thank you again for this act of solidarity .
i will pass on your words of sympathy to the victims and to the people of my country .

not everyone has managed to come .
the remaining items will be discussed , except some of the items planned for thursday .
applause 
i think it is absolutely abysmal that you have done that .
surely the time has come for this place to be shut down .
the only thing is that the votes will be held on 5 and 6 may .
i do not want any further points of order now .
monday 
no changes .
one minute speeches on matters of political importance
the next item is the one minute speeches on matters of political importance .
mr president , thank you for letting me speak again .
if I may give you my answer I will take what you have said very seriously .
before we begin , I would like to make an announcement .
i have some specific questions .
thank you for your remark .
application of the new rules will begin with the meeting in brussels .
pl madam president , my nation has been hit by a great tragedy .
however , it is nothing new for the european union to apply double standards .
having said which , it is vital that we correct the chronic social pathogenies that give birth to violence .
we need to strike at poverty and unemployment .
duisburg , home of the largest steelworks in europe , is in my constituency .
i would ask the commission to respond to this appeal .
madam president , travellers whose holiday plans have been ruined by the volcanic ash face confusion over insurance .
i would like , today , to mention the problem of eurostat .
pt today , we are facing a natural disaster with unpredictable consequences .
it is our duty to prevent the occurrence of social dumping .
pl the financial and economic crisis has hit the poorest people the hardest .
this is at a time when europe , or most of europe , is recovering from a deep recession .
that is because the government has intervened .
these programmes forecast the medium and long term positions of the various member states .
those who criticised the treaty of lisbon spoke of a democratic deficit .
many may say , of course , that in a formal sense , this oversight already existed .
from now on , it will be possible to do so .
in my report , I strove to make it clear that parliament insists on these rights .
we will not accept any additional obligation that goes beyond what is laid down in the treaty .
we might disagree on some specific questions but our objectives are the same .
the treaty of lisbon has now changed that .
the cooperation was extremely constructive and I would also like to express my sincere thanks for that .
thank you , mr szájer .
article 290 is therefore a product of the illegitimate lisbon treaty .
once again , this has a lot to do with transparency .
on that note , I would say keep up the good work .
we will be constructive partners on the road to revolutionising democracy .
delegated acts can also be published during the timeframe within which the european parliament and council can raise objections .
i absolutely agree with mr leinen that the lisbon treaty brought in enormous changes .
this was underlined by the rapporteur , mr szájer .
we consider it important primarily for those areas where codecision did not previously exist .
we are the ones with the legislative power and we delegate these powers to the commission .
the debate is closed .
how we can now build on this is the question facing us today .
we have seen how effective the bringing together of different national blacklists into one comprehensive eu wide list has been .
this will ultimately be the most effective way of improving safety for all passengers .
this allows them to be in the best possible position to aid the passengers .
the list has no extra territorial effect it does not apply outside the european union .
we have seen some examples of that .
to conclude , I also think that we should work towards a worldwide blacklist .
this is about aviation safety for european passengers .
we simply want everyone who flies here in europe to be transported safely and to arrive safely .
they took the flight and were stranded , and so they had no information that would have protected them .
madam president , commissioner , parliament showed a lot of initiative when it came to drawing up this blacklist .
i have tried this out for myself .
so here we have a problem then .
it is worth saying this , in defence of the interests of the european consumer .
the european parliament is speaking on this matter yet again .
what is happening here to inform people who need to fly ?
at the same time , however , we must also help third countries improve their civil aviation safety standards .
competent third country authorities need to improve their ability to monitor the air carriers they grant licences to .
this information should be provided no later than at the time of purchasing the ticket .
we also work very much with icao .
we will look into this accordingly and see what happened .
no one really does it properly .
there are states in which only the end user pays , and there are others which have a mixed system .
it is not about earnings and not about profits it is about security .
i would just like to emphasise two specific issues which are dealt with in the report .
thank you very much for this excellent report .
i was targeted a moment ago .
there is a group there which , by international standards , is classified as far right .
the far right wingers sit over there .
blue card questions on a personal comment under rule 151 are not permitted .
i would like half a minute to ask a question .
i would suggest that you place this sort of thing in between the reports .
we will now continue with the debate .
i allowed the personal explanation because the previous point of order referred directly to mr martin .
she arranged everything together with you , and was also completely satisfied .
here , we have said that actually , the member states should do this .
nobody should be lost in a jungle of unclear charges and levies .
the president cut off the speaker 
this is quite an important consideration in my view .
therefore , this dossier also has an economic aspect .
we are now talking about around 30 % of the costs .
therefore , these three points are crucial for me .
airport security is the responsibility of member states .
the directive on aviation security charges and the directive on airport charges should be harmonised .
these security measures should not , all the same , impede the smooth flow of passenger traffic at airports .
regrettably , this procedure does not include the option of receiving the item later at the addressee's address .
commissioner , if we want to help europe become competitive , we must forget about setting up new authorities .
what is clear is that the ash cloud has only delayed the pilotsstrike which has been announced .
i would like to quickly raise another point .
this is the task of airports and airlines which must become more open and transparent .
i take a positive view of the subsidiarity in the report , and it should definitely be retained .
whoever orders government related security measures also pays for them .
the cost for extra security should , in the end , be covered by the member states .
its obligations go beyond that , because the state is not simply another service provider motivated exclusively by profit .
i thought that excessive , but nevertheless believe that we have provided improvements throughout the system .
madam president , I am somewhat embarrassed after so much praise , and so I will keep it short .
this is why I am appealing to the council and the member states to move on this .
the vote will take place during the next plenary sitting in brussels .
only in this way will it be possible to guarantee greater transparency and information for passengers .
these are in line with the changes made by the council and in line with correcting the guidelines .
so we foresee that this could be presented to the college on 5 may .
the commission will then engage in the preparation of the proposals for the new ten t and its financing .
it does not fit into the european landscape .
that is his responsibility .
we must get rid of this transrapid system .
it was a nice model from a scientific perspective , but it has no place in europe .
we will manage , nevertheless .
we need to look at what adds value for the european union and european taxpayers .
de madam president , the trans european networks are indeed utilised for regular traffic in europe .
that is what it is all about , and that is also what we will debate accordingly .
this makes shipping a crucial economic sector and one that has to compete in the global market .
we know that many countries the world over support their maritime fleets in very diverse ways .
for me , that is a misnomer and I would have preferred something likesubstandardships .
our main aim is to ensure and further increase the long term sustainability and performance of european shipping .
this means efficient , safe , secure and environmentally friendly maritime transport services .
maritime transport provides for high quality jobs in europe and fuels research and european industrial innovation .
in this context , an emphasis must lie on the maintenance and improvement of the international order .
we are faced with threats like protectionism , unfair competition , substandard shipping or piracy .
i would also like to answer the point on state aid guidelines for shipping in 20of course , european shipping faces huge challenges at present , as well as an exogenous challenge .
we also highlight protection against piracy .
i also support the requirements for shipbuilding and steel quality .
if they sail only half full , the freight costs are too high .
the problem is far greater in the waters around indonesia .
that also affects eu shipping companies .
one final point we are often told how important the shipbuilding industry is for the eu .
yet where is the debate on the responsible , environmentally sound scrapping of ships ?
europe is a major competitor on the maritime transport market , especially in terms of transporting passengers and containers .
the european union's position in the global market in this sector must be enhanced .
at the same time , we must also play on a level playing field .
that has become abundantly clear .
ninety per cent of our exports and imports are transported via the ports .
we need new blood .
it has been mentioned that maritime transport is the vehicle for 80 % of the world's trade .
the first is piracy , on which the recommendations are all good , but inevitably general .
we are working now in the college to prepare a detailed roadmap for implementation .
i should like to refer to three specific questions .
one concerns state aid guidelines for ports .
on maritime ports , we do not have any legislation at this stage in the pipeline .
finally , thank you once again , mr president and honourable members , for this debate .
i think this report is a good example of constructive cooperation between the different groups .
i wonder whether the commission might like to consider that idea again .
finally , the concept ofgreen ports, as some members have dubbed it .
that is , ships have to behave well .
it is a good mission and has already proved a success .
such cooperation seems ideal to me .
mr president , commissioner kroes , europeana is to be the major digital cultural project of the european union .
many people still do not know about this .
that is the huge task that we now have to face together .
the europeana site is the result of an unprecedented collaboration between european libraries , archives and museums .
more can be done and more needs to be done .
i am glad that parliament joins the commission in asking member states to make fast progress in doing so .
the sooner the better .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 149 
europeana must not turn into a portal like wikipedia where anyone can input text without it being verified beforehand .
competition with google also spotlights numerous issues which will have to be resolved .
furthermore , I should like to see a slightly new approach and in particular a more holistic approach .
this is important for two reasons .
last but not least , we need to get to grips with the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry .
in fact , in many commercial centres , it costs millions , as large scale industrial equipment is involved .
the european union must ensure that legislation is up to date and that supervision is in operation .
the rules adopted should be implemented .
our future strategy will have to make that clear .
animal welfare is an important issue .
european legislation on this matter must be rigorously applied , as mrs paulsen's report recommends .
the 2013 cap needs to be ambitious .
it must be based on goals that will help citizens to understand why we need a common agricultural policy .
ten per cent of greenhouse gases still originate from agriculture .
i completely agree that in future , agriculture must be greener and more environmentally friendly .
pl mr president , I am impressed by this report's comprehensive approach .
it is the southern end of an area of peatland that stretches straight up from england into scotland .
of course , as the peatland dries out , it releases global warming gases .
a huge potential supply of global warming gas is being released from what should be a wonderful area .
the fight against climate change is an absolute priority globally .
the debate is closed .
climate change has a direct influence on agriculture .
agriculture in areas with natural handicaps a special health check short presentation 
there are nonetheless very specific doubts as to whether the proposed criteria will be sufficiently precise .
we also need to look closely at the social situation , which plays a major role in disadvantaged regions .
it is the commissioner whom I would like to address in particular .
we therefore need to move forward and move forward quickly .
there seems to be a lot of confusion arising from the criteria for defining less favourable regions .
can it be that the criteria used up till now have been so inappropriate ?
an important question is how to maintain agricultural production in less favoured areas .
i would like to address a couple of issues .
the council has decided to remove the socio economic criteria from the objectives of natural handicap payments .
the importance of granting appropriate compensatory payments for less favoured areas is indisputable .
the market neither rewards nor compensates farmers for these achievements in areas where farming is at a natural disadvantage .
it is clear that the agricultural industry needs to change .
it does need to adopt a more flexible , lighter touch approach .
it also needs to be easier to interpret .
that must be possible and we must endeavour to achieve it .
we must ensure that those with entitlements also have the right to turn to an independent court for remedy .
i am thinking here of tobacco , hop and other specialist production of this kind .
member of the commission . mr president , simplification and better regulation are priorities for the commission .
the commission fully agrees that simplification and reduction of administrative burden should be of particular benefit for farmers .
this will enable the farmers to spend more time on their core agricultural activities .
but simplification is an ongoing process work will continue in 20moreover , there is an overall reflection process on the future of the common agricultural policy .
take as an example traceability .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 149 
they are new changes in relation to those we adopted yesterday at 17.they are additional changes .
firstly , we are withdrawing question time with the council from the order of business .
the european parliament services will be here .
there will not be a plenary sitting .
quite a number of matters were decided .
from now on , a task force will be at work which includes the parliamentary services .
decisions about this have not yet been made , but they will be made in the next few days .
these concern longer term answers to the present crisis .
it is , of course , an unexpected and unprecedented crisis that must be tackled in the appropriate manner .
despite that , we have acted and reacted .
that brings me to the second part of my statement what action has been taken in this case .
we have to ensure the highest safety standards for our citizens .
three types of zones are included in this decision , based on the degree of contamination .
the third zone is not affected by ash , resulting in no restrictions of any type on operations .
eurocontrol is providing maps every six hours with the relevant information for the national authorities .
the model for resuming flights is the most important thing .
we should not panic about state aid and any other measures to help the air transport sector .
passenger rights is another important issue , and we must enforce the implementation of passenger rights .
there is nothing wrong with that model .
we started discussing this yesterday .
to say that the european model completely failed is totally wrong .
those kinds of decisions are in the hands of independent experts and independent bodies .
however , these cannot be arbitrary decisions , but are in the hands of a special body .
that body held a meeting , and we held discussions with it , on sunday .
these were very difficult discussions , as what was under consideration were people's lives .
concerning passengers , the most important thing is to get people back home or to their destinations .
the model provided for now is quite suitable for resuming the vast majority of flights .
that is why it is important that we are having this emergency debate in parliament today .
but what happened in the days following this ?
it is necessary that we carry out more work , tailored to our specific circumstances .
we have to take decisive action .
it is therefore extremely important that we coordinate this at a european level .
that is what I call on you to ensure .
i hope that it will be possible to get them home quickly .
many of the citizens of europe were annoyed about this .
they were suffering financially and would have liked to have seen a quicker response .
we must protect their rights .
the human race is not omnipotent and never will be .
it is right that the response to this volcanic eruption has come from europe .
we are calling for the european airspace to only be opened again when there is no risk at all .
the possibility that a few struggling airlines might collapse in this crisis does not cause me much concern .
however , we cannot allow major and reputable companies which put safety first to collapse .
too much money and too many jobs are at stake .
in my opinion , it is irresponsible for airlines to ask their pilots to fly at their own risk .
we will be talking later about employment in the european union .
i therefore call for swift action , serious action , and action in full knowledge of the facts .
nature teaches us respect and , at the same time , makes clear to us the limits of globalisation .
in my opinion , the top priority is the safety of passengers .
justifiably , we have discussed this subject often in parliament .
for me , the future lies in the single european sky .
let us see how we can really integrate safety and efficiency with that .
that was , indeed , the right decision to make , but does that go far enough ?
so , we need to make preparations for the years to come .
safety and the common good are the priority .
i also believe that , structurally speaking , we must provide far greater support for videoconferencing .
the diversification of the situation which arose was not taken into account at all .
i should like , at the same time , to say that europe suffers from too little credibility .
secondly , I would like to thank all the parties involved for their efforts .
i would like to raise two issues .
is state aid through national budgets the best solution ?
the second issue is related to the european union's capacity to manage crises .
this is not acceptable .
we need a certain amount of reserves .
that is not right , either .
i agree that dealing with it from 27 perspectives , or countries , is not successful .
one of the biggest problems facing the passengers today is the confusion .
the president cut off the speaker 
we should welcome investments in advanced communications systems for virtual meetings , as well as investment in high speed railways .
we must closely analyse what happened and prepare an effective response in the event of such a phenomenon recurring .
that terrifies me .
we clearly have to learn from this situation and take appropriate measures .
repatriating them must be our priority .
although this approach is precautionary , as it has to be , it raises important questions .
the work done at european and national level was not sufficient .
pl mr president , mr kallas , we are certainly dealing with a crisis situation .
i think the decision to halt flights out of concern for passenger safety was a wise one .
i believe that this would have been possible , but in principle , what was done was acceptable .
the president cut off the speaker 
let us therefore be consistent .
the experience we are gaining is too expensive , but is very instructive .
thirdly , efficient transport is the lifeblood of the economy .
secondly , we need to think about the question of economic responsibility .
i hope those rapid procedures will be introduced .
what we have experienced is something we will experience again .
we need a safety net .
we want passengers from europe to be transported safely .
we want safety , but we also want transport options .
we need aircraft , as we cannot replace flying with another solution .
a lot has been said about high speed trains .
the president cut off the speaker 
in the face of the slightest risk , the precautionary principle has become an invitation to abandon all responsibility .
therefore , action was taken .
today , yesterday's decision by the extraordinary council of ministers is being implemented .
airspace is therefore gradually being opened up , but this will naturally depend on the conditions and on nature .
first of all , these events have given us much food for thought as regards our strategic plans .
concerning the economic impact , we will take all aspects into account and will make proposals .
we must be very balanced in our approach .
there can be no miracle .
it is that of implementation and enforcement , which is in the hands of member states .
i was in contact with ministers .
now we have a more differentiated approach .
we have three or four days at least before the majority of flights resume .
it is still a difficult situation and we must deal with the consequences .
thank you for your remarks .
it is very important that they have listened to your remarks .
the debate is closed .
we should use our imagination .
we do not usually think about the huge significance of air transport .
the airlines have suffered the greatest financial losses .
in recent years , air transport has had a clear lead over other means of transport .
it was faster , safer and more convenient for passengers .
i hope that the single european sky will become a reality one day .
in my view , the session must be held as normal .
commission legislative and work programme for 2010 debate 
i would like to stress that a good number of commissioners are also present in the chamber .
the whole european commission is strongly represented , because the subject is extremely important for all of us .
so there are some quite new rules for this part session .
this programme is the direct outcome of our political dialogue .
this being so , it provides a solid platform for achieving ambitious results .
our involvement has always been in line with the principle of solidarity , but also of responsibility .
i am convinced that our proposal on hedge funds and private equity will soon reach a decisive stage .
i want to underline the importance of social inclusion in our vision for europe 20the real strength of a society rests on the opportunities it creates for its weakest citizens .
i can assure you that parliament will be fully associated at all stages of the budget review .
before finishing , I would like to briefly explain a number of innovations in the work programme .
at the same time , the programme includes many other initiatives for 2010 and beyond .
they expect it from us , and we have a duty to work for their prosperity and well being .
i would just like to stress that the strategic partnership of which you spoke is very important to us .
the european people's party prepared two lists with regard to the commission's plans .
and what they eventually achieved had nothing whatsoever to do with the final objectives .
now let us move on to what the commission should do .
jobs , jobs , jobs must be our guiding principle .
it goes without saying that we must consolidate our budgets .
my next point relates to the budgetary consolidation .
we need more investment .
we cannot tolerate this .
mr barroso , you referred to the monti report .
i would now like to come to my final and decisive point .
we need the commission to call for these things with a powerful voice .
it is about preventing these things from happening as far as possible by monitoring economic and budgetary changes .
once again , I can hear governments saying that we cannot investigate their statistics or their budgetary procedure .
why do governments have to keep their statistics and their budget procedures secret ?
however , this partnership must be based on a strong position for parliament and for the commission .
in the days to come , we will be negotiating on the framework agreement .
it specifies some of the details , but the decisive factor is the spirit behind it .
this is why the commission must have a powerful voice .
we urgently need budgetary , economic and industrial coordination .
i believe that these would be powerful acts that might well put us back on the path to growth .
the work programme that you have presented is very wide ranging and contains headings that sound very ambitious .
this means that you are already breaking one of your major promises .
mrs hedegaard's people have not yet decided .
the commission must be their ally , not their adversary .
in taking a lead in developing a vibrant , dynamic european economy , president barroso will have our support .
is it because no one has acted yet and the title is a piece of self criticism ?
i will give you an example .
another important element for the competitiveness of businesses is the international trade situation .
at this time of crisis , it is important to strengthen the european union's trade defence system .
the problem is that the eu has not faced up to globalisation it has embraced it .
however , my message is also for europhiles .
there is no doubt that ageing populations are a concern in many countries .
the children of such immigrants are allegedly as european as the indigenous population they are not .
distinctive cultures are made by distinctive peoples and not the other way round .
replacing europeans with people from the third world will mean that europe will be replaced by the third world .
yet the very people who are against european level powers are now protesting against europe .
applause 
the 2020 agenda , I believe , focuses europe on what is most important .
we shall try to prove equal to the task with which you are entrusting us .
applause 
we think that this is good for europeans that it is good for our citizens .
written statements rule 149 
therefore , we must firstly focus particular attention on the problem of poverty facing those in work .
most attention should be paid to increasing youth unemployment , one of society's most acute problems .
it is right that europe must respond jointly to the crisis .
the europe 2020 strategy is intended to be the response to the current crisis .
in spite of this , I hope the priorities will not be only empty promises .
the strength of the programme is its measures for combating the crisis .
this must be a process , and not electioneering .
the increase in the employment rate is closely linked to the eu's industrial policy .
when will the commission table a proposal concerning the necessary funding for the development of the trans european transport infrastructure ?
the first is the continuation of humanitarian assistance and , in particular , shelter , sanitation and health services .
this is a priority in our programme , as is strengthening camp management skills .
most of them were completely depleted after the earthquake .
thirdly , we are making sure that donor coordination results in building on each other's comparative advantage .
i will give you two specific examples .
firstly , in the food sector , we are encouraging local purchasing of food .
it is very important now that we concentrate our aid as quickly as possible .
i will keep the european parliament constantly informed of the progress made on haiti reconstruction .
we also need to discuss with the authorities a couple of issues on how to better deliver our assistance .
two aspects stand out , in particular .
there are three points I want to raise .
problems will also crop up associated with having the necessary workforce and the extent of their training .
the donorsconference , which was held at the united nations on 31 march , was a success .
we need to make a significant investment in local agriculture if we are to guarantee food security .
moreover , without security , it is difficult to maintain independence and neutrality in humanitarian work .
the donorsassistance must clearly be well coordinated and of a high quality .
european resources need to be used efficiently .
obviously , an earthquake caused the disaster in haiti .
these measures have two basic stages , and we are talking about these two stages today .
the third stage is something only for us .
not even the experience of several rescue groups was sufficient .
i also urge you not to forget the future commitments that we need to make .
we need to stick to the pledges we are making now .
i would like to start with the bigger policy issue , on the eu improving its response capabilities .
i can assure you that this is a very high priority for our team .
in haiti , an ecologically destroyed island , of course it had implications for the scale of this destruction .
we are thinking in the long term when we think of chile .
we are working on the same bases and on well prepared ground .
we are working on property rights .
we have a land cadastre and we will work on it , but there could be risks .
the risks could definitely come from ownership of the political process .
they are the guarantee that , if the process is well organised , it will be successful .
the sitting was suspended at 13.10 and resumed at 15.05 
it is now time for us to carry out an interim review of the aid effort in haiti .
how was the entire aid effort coordinated ?
the purpose of the office of high representative is to strengthen the eu's role as a global player .
some member states launched individual aid campaigns and others acted jointly .
the high representative should now at last be realising what her job is all about .
meanwhile , international commentators are criticising our uncoordinated action .
these are very optimistic sums .
what is your view on this approach ?
given an estimated total of eur 8.4 billion , that makes a profit of eur 620 million .
it is not .
the treaty does not say that it is forbidden to take on debts .
i repeat the treaty clearly states that a member state cannot be forced to take on debts .
i am here to reply on behalf of the commission .
let us also be clear from the point of view of the commission .
naturally , we have been very cautious on that point .
it was parliament's insistence on scrapping the national opt outs from the directive which led to the stalemate .
recently , we have spoken a great deal about the crisis and how to overcome it .
do you think that we and the commission have done enough ?
i think the commission proposals were the right ones .
the financial sector needs this kind of credibility to finance the economy .
that is my question .
i apologise for that word .
furthermore , of course , the high representative is an ex officio vice president of the commission .
president of the commission . I do not agree .
but there are other community competences that should not go now to the intergovernmental arm .
it should be kept , of course , in the community method .
so the high representative / vice president of the commission is , as we say , usually double hatted .
to produce a shoe in our region , in southern italy , costs eur the cost of the finished product from china is eur 5.a baby grow produced by us costs eur 4 5 , whereas one from china costs eur I know that protectionist measures are undesirable , but what is the answer ?
that will be self defeating for us .
that is why it is so much dependent on the correction of some fiscal imbalances .
in 2009 , 2.7 million people in the euro area lost their jobs .
all the issues you have raised are dealt with in the 2020 strategy , mr daerden .
we are also starting to see more consistent signs of stabilisation in some member states .
we have more than 20 % of young people unemployed in europe .
two of them I have already mentioned .
will the commission embrace this roadmap ?
i did everything to be present at his funeral .
for this is the best way to encourage self employment , and rates of self employment are still too low today .
hence , in this context , these questions would appear to be justified .
this is just one of many examples of jobs being lost in europe .
your work programme does not provide very definitive information in this respect .
that is the only way to do it .
fi mr president , commissioner , unemployment and exclusion among young people are a big problem .
this would therefore require a large amount of labour migration .
in my opinion , there is something of a contradiction here .
president of the commission . I want to win this competitiveness battle globally .
there is no contradiction between having longer working lives and having some immigration to europe .
this shows that there is a problem of mismatch between the supply and demand for labour .
in fact , it has been possible to keep people in work for longer .
that is not true .
why does this not form part of europe 2020 ?
growth , not only smart growth and equitable growth , but also sustainable growth .
there are some member states where the employment rate for women is still very much lower than for men .
this summit is not , however , just another summit , mrs ashton .
these are important negotiations and dialogues . they strengthen our relationship .
there is also much that we can do in practice on regional integration .
all the same , I regret the absence of concrete measures and of a genuine development strategy .
the aim of the eu latin american partnership is not just to protect commercial profits .
we also need to develop the association agreements with mexico and chile , which have been a real success .
the spanish presidency is to be congratulated on the work it has done in this regard .
i think that these are major steps forward .
there are also legal proceedings under way in brazil .
brazil , along with mexico , is now designated as an eu strategic partner .
recently , the stephen roth institute published a report which highlights several somewhat unpleasant aspects of this issue .
it is very comprehensive .
however , I regret that the report does not tackle two essential issues more directly .
we believe that we should devote ourselves to those issues that are strictly essential .
our national car , the dacia , is one example I can give of this .
es madam president , I , too , would like to congratulate mr salafranca sánchez neyra .
this is going to be extremely important for the european union and , above all , for latin america .
however , ladies and gentlemen , we need to help latin america .
we always need to keep this vision in mind .
let us join together with them so that we can be stronger .
we have made a great deal of progress since 199we have similar values and human rights and we are also linked by the desire for democracy and peace .
however , the region does not deserve this .
however , it is a fact that these principles are often violated .
there is still work to be done in this area and improvements still need to be made .
i cannot help but stress the strategic importance of good relations with latin america .
the european union has done excellent work as regards protecting and strengthening consumer rights and health .
the president cut off the speaker 
it is part of the dossier that the colombian security services are preparing in her case .
however , this is not just about starting negotiations with the mercosur trading bloc .
we are the biggest investor in that region .
we are continuing to follow the situation very closely .
brazil and iran were specific examples given .
climate change is also a very important issue .
we should remember that we have a key dialogue with this region .
mr president , I would like to thank all my fellow members for their speeches .
however , we need to move from words to actions , and this is shown in the association agreements .
i think , mrs ashton , that you have negotiated the agreements with colombia and peru very well .
the colombian people are clamouring for peace , and this agreement is definitely deserved .
we represent 25 % of their exports , and they represent 2 % of ours .
kyrgyzstan debate 
we know from the presidential elections last year that there is considerable room for progress .
however , there may be specific medical needs .
more than 80 persons died and many hundreds were wounded from gunfire opened against demonstrators in bishkek .
these events cannot simply be put on one side .
whether justifiably or not , this was obviously one of the causes of the clashes .
if this were to take the form of fundamentalism , the results could be catastrophic for us .
mr president , baroness ashton , I would also like to thank you for your statement .
we hope that this cycle is not beginning again and that mrs otunbayeva has a different approach .
her past , and the attitude that she has often demonstrated , are indicators of this .
the same thing also applies to uzbekistan and to other countries .
this is a very sensitive region , as mr brok has already said .
this is not only about the energy supply from turkmenistan through to kazakhstan .
i think that was both sensible and useful .
we need to help this region and kyrgyzstan to move towards cooperation and away from confrontation .
however , the eu's support is essential to ensure that country's independence .
this is the key to ensuring that the country plays a major role in this region of the world .
mr president , last week's riots have led kyrgyzstan into a political , judicial and economic crisis .
criminal groups operate freely in the country .
the present interim government is unable to counter any of these threats .
the situation is completely unclear for the local people .
people are living well below the poverty line .
this country has a strategic position in central asia .
amnesty international has also called our attention to their plight .
over 80 fatalities is a bad signal for the building of kyrgyzstan .
so I repeat my fervent appeal and have my fingers crossed for mrs ashton's mission .
there is a simple explanation for this situation .
our timeliness in providing aid to reduce and weaken all social tension will be decisive .
rumour has it that the snipers who shot into the crowd in bishkek were uzbek and tajik mercenaries .
it is really only then that democracy will have a genuine chance in central asia .
with this eu digital library , the diversity and the wealth of our culture will be made accessible .
one of our continent's horizons is africa , but we have blackened that horizon with slavery and colonialism .
we are working very closely with the un and with the osce .
the vote will take place during the first part session in may .
written statements rule 149 
the risk of civil war breaking out and of asecond afghanistanmust be averted .
no one is in any doubt that kyrgyzstan plays a special role here .
in addition , we should take every possible measure to prevent radicalisation of the country .
in the long term perspective , it is essential to develop a new strategy for the entire region .
eu canada summit debate 
with our bilateral relations , the summit will deal with efforts to upgrade and modernise the eu canada relationship .
our goal is clear we want visa free travel to canada for all eu citizens as soon as possible .
haiti will also be on the agenda of the summit for obvious reasons .
in a world of big challenges and where change is constant , we need partners .
since 1959 , canada has been one of the closest and the oldest partners of the european union .
guaranteeing reciprocity in bilateral relations is one of the european union's basic principles .
i am thinking about five points in particular .
it is de facto still in force , but no longer has a basis in law .
this new legal basis must ensure that civil rights are respected .
this is not all about provoking canada .
no mention is made of the fact that canada did not play a particularly positive role in copenhagen .
happily , ordinary people in canada are prepared to fight to protect their public water provision .
is the eu apparatus too cumbersome and bureaucratic to deal with this task ?
it seems that the ceta refers to significant privatisation , deregulation and restructuring .
this involves local authorities being prevented from applying specific local or ethnic procurement guidelines .
one year on , we are obliged to note that we are far from achieving this objective .
i do not understand why canada takes different approaches .
i also believe that the czech republic must benefit again from the visa waiver .
instead of reducing emissions by 6 % compared with 1990 , emissions in canada have risen by 26 % .
the production of tar sand is the main cause .
it is high time that all possible steps were taken to achieve a breakthrough in this long drawn out affair .
the pressure on canada should not be relieved , but , on the contrary , should rather be increased .
i firmly believe that we must stop dragging our feet .
two important subjects have been raised in this discussion .
we ended up coming out looking incoherent , disorganised and weak .
i am in favour of a specific ban on recording with video cameras in cinemas .
this should be enforced in canada .
however , it is important for us to find a middle way .
we should support the protection of intellectual property , but oppose blanket surveillance and persecution on the internet .
these companies employ two thirds of all workers and generate 80 % of tax income .
canada's record on climate change is poor and canada was obstructive during the copenhagen negotiations .
let me begin with trade , because quite a lot of the different contributions focused on that .
however , we should be very ambitious on both sides .
there is a lot of work going on to try and resolve this matter .
honourable members were quite right to raise this question and it will be part of the discussions .
written statements rule 149 
part one 
subject creation of a european credit rating authority
we will , therefore , make this amendment .
i have not taken up a position on this subject .
this is the stage we are at .
there would also be the question of the public authorities interfering in the work of such an agency .
the rule is that , if the author is absent , the question lapses .
the increasing popularity of smart phones has created a new market in terms of technology , software and applications .
de I welcome the fact that the commission is dealing with this subject from a competition perspective .
what measures does it intend to take on theactivityof credit rating agencies ?
this is a sad role .
a debate was held earlier , and I have no wish to recycle it .
right now , can the european union and the institutions stop taking account of these agenciesratings ?
subject eu broadband strategy
one of those reviewed state aid rules was connected with , for example , broadband .
the commission would support their preparations fully , including preparations for the actual cash changeover .
for the time being , sweden does not fulfil all the criteria for introducing the euro .
de mr de gucht , I just have two supplementary points to make .
do you think that estonia will become a member in the foreseeable future , perhaps even this year ?
member of the commission . as I rightly mentioned , sweden does not fulfil certain criteria .
it seems to me that these are , let us say , criteria which are possible to fulfil .
subject extending cuts to the private sector
the commission is aware that fiscal austerity measures and wage moderation may have a negative short term impact on demand .
unfortunately , this is the result of policies that have been conducted over a certain period of time .
subject conflict of responsibilities of member states and the eu in connection with imf agreement s 
subject budget deficit in cyprus
if you have no time , walk out that door now .
i am a member of parliament , I have a question down for answer here .
i have a lot of engagements as well .
nevertheless , question time is scheduled until 8.30 on our agenda .
the programme spells out the medium term budgetary strategy until 20subject greece and the current crisis in euro cooperation
however , as soon as the consequences of the financial crisis hit europe , the situation deteriorated drastically .
member of the commission . certainly not .
there is no longer such a thing as a greek currency .
how could such a fund operate in practical terms ?
consistency with the stability oriented governance framework of the emu needs to be ensured .
subject financial monitoring procedures for the member states
underlying vulnerabilities of public finances should be taken properly into account when designing the optimal consolidation part .
all I can tell you is that olli rehn owes you a big one , apparently !
so , what did we achieve ?
and those who suffer at the end of the day are those in need of protection .
so we are pleased to have been able to breathe a little more life into this body .
it is a european institution we are creating .
the support office will therefore be a cornerstone in the building of a common asylum system .
the support office will , as you all know , be located in valletta .
however , we have not yet taken it a step further .
this body will allow us to ensure the consistency that is lacking in current practice .
however , we must recognise that this matter leaves a slightly bitter taste in the mouth .
our debates will prove it , if necessary , when they take place on thursday afternoon .
since 2004 , in particular , we have been seeing the downwards harmonisation of reception procedures and conditions .
as a human rights activist in france , I am well placed to know what has caused these results .
the majority of the proposals made by parliament at first reading have been adopted by the council .
in my humble opinion , something else is lacking and that something is security .
establishing this agency is another step towards centralising eu asylum policy .
the new asylum support office is therefore not fit for purpose and should not be established .
is it the commission's intention to repeal the uk opt out in this area too ?
you are supposed to represent them and they deserve to know what you have planned .
it is not just another agency .
it would gather information , it would put up a portal , it would have experts , etc .
as some of you have said , this is part of developing a common asylum system in europe .
that is not the same as an immigration policy , and people really should recognise the difference .
the vote will take place during the part session in the first week of may
they are a logical continuation of the documents which we adopted last year .
here is just one example .
advance payments for countries worst hit by the crisis will be increased for 20both groups of measures are important because of their message to the beneficiaries and because of their practical utility .
they will bring fresh money for the member states to get out of the crisis .
i would also like to ask you to pass on my thanks to mr kirilov .
in addition , we want to help to overcome the crisis .
the eur 350 billion of european funds are for the benefit of our fellow european citizens .
we must provide rapid and targeted help .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr hahn , let us speak plainly .
we believe that it is not possible to justify this to european taxpayers .
the proposal is a compromise .
the first is that we very much welcome the simplification of the structural funds .
too much time has already been wasted .
however , I must speak openly .
these member states will benefit from this and from additional advance payments from the cohesion and european structural funds .
there was an opportunity to table amendments so that the commission's original draft could be reused .
why can we not repeat this scheme in 2008 and 2009 ?
that would be a very positive step .
can you answer that ?
to conclude , we could also show some solidarity .
why have they not shown any solidarity and transferred those resources to other countries ?
that is entirely permissible and would allow those countries to get back on their feet .
that would be showing real solidarity , but unfortunately it has not happened .
however , this report is fairly limited and does not seem to address many of them .
we need to ensure that relaxing the cofinance criteria does not reduce accountability .
the commission presented the first draft as long ago as july last year .
we will not decide until may .
the whole legislative process has taken nine months up to today .
the commission's initial proposal dates from june 200that is unacceptable .
one less excuse for whom ?
mr kirilov's report is a good example of this .
i am very glad about this , and this is how I understand the amendments to the regulation .
the president cut off the speaker 
i hope that this report will be only a first step .
i would say that this is a european insight .
despite all the difficulties and mistakes , we have adhered to this principle in the initiative .
we will be providing the available regional funds to wales and to all the other regions in future .
i would like to make a second remark to mrs swinburne , but not just to her .
in other words , it is not simply an act of general solidarity .
written statements rule 149 
drafting this report demonstrates the european parliament's desire to resolve the problems highlighted in this regard .
i support the proposals aimed at simplifying the procedures for accessing european funds .
i welcome these measures , especially at the moment when member states are being affected by the economic crisis .
the economic crisis has demonstrated the need for public action to support private activities that are in difficulty .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for the work he has done .
i also welcome the agreement being finally approved within the council and committee on regional development .
it is high time for this next step now before new unattributed documents surface .
those , then , are the measures that have already been taken .
the commission pays close attention to the development of the markets in other sectors .
the decision to increase the links between european agriculture and the world market is also correct .
we must provide rules .
it is clear that canada has what many farmers and many consumers believe is a tried and tested model .
of course , it is important not to undermine the competitiveness of europe's agri food industry .
there has been a significant drop in the prices of basic agricultural products .
it produces public goods and it needs public european financial support .
guaranteeing producersincomes depends , above all , on safeguarding transparency in the food supply chain .
to close , we cannot confine ourselves to designing future market tools for after 20 hu the debate so far has shown that this is a very complex problem .
there are four theoretical options .
less aid , less public intervention and more restrictions on production that is a truly explosive combination .
it is true that the general economic crisis is aggravating the situation .
despite the situation in europe , meat , certain cereals , fruits and vegetables are all affected .
we cannot continue with such a policy .
it mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I come from southern italy .
on this matter , we in this chamber seem to be of the same opinion .
that represents a reduction of 24 % . particularly large losses occurred in 2008 200in contrast , mixed livestock farms .
there are other objectives of course , but those are the fundamental ones that we must take into account .
i think that I have more or less covered all the speeches and all the problems that were raised .
the effect on prices during the recent dairy crisis is just one example .
but we are not out of the woods yet , so to speak .
this has to change .
i hope the commission is as concerned about this as members of parliament are .
the most difficult situation was definitely that facing the dairy market .
the present mechanisms of intervention in the dairy sector and the establishment of the dairy fund are proving insufficient .
we can already imagine what will happen when these instruments expire .

2008 discharge debate 
fr mr president , I note that the court of auditors is absent from this house .
we know that the votes are postponed and will be held in two weekstime in brussels .
discharge to the european institutions comes at a difficult , but important moment .
i thank you and look forward to your comments .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , I have been asking myself what discharge really is .
i was responsible for carrying out this exercise in respect of the european parliament for the 2008 financial year .
after all , ladies and gentlemen , citizens have the right to know what is happening to their taxes .
this is an extremely large amount of money .
a critical approach is essential , as I have said .
nevertheless , my report is critical .
i wanted to show that we can do even better .
we are pleased to note the opening of the internal audit unit .
we do not have any serious reservations concerning the committee of the regions or the european ombudsman .
if we want to organise it for the next time , they could maybe be present next year .
that is what I would suggest .
i will also speak to mr zapatero in person about this , because he leads the rotating presidency .
i will , today , find a solution to this for the future .
in 2000 , the agencies employed 1 219 people , whereas , today , they employ 4 79this general increase is certainly impressive .
to conclude , I do , of course , encourage the agencies to follow this example .
achieving an unqualified statement of assurance from the court of auditors remains the commission's collegial objective .
in retrospect , the continued underfunding of category iv is clear .
obviously , amendments to the legal framework are also beginning to have an impact .
actually , I wanted to make a completely different speech .
i will not do this now because I believe that we cannot simply ignore what happened today .
the only institution that has to take it seriously is the commission .
we cannot go on as we have up to now .
i would like to seize the initiative and turn once again to the council .
we expect the immediate legalisation of this state of affairs in budgetary legislation .
i am talking about the european centre for disease prevention and control , the ecdc in stockholm .
to this day , none of the employees have a personal identity number , the so called folkbokföring number .
the list could go on .
as a result , all of this has landed before our committee on petitions .
in any case , the situation is untenable ..
the president cut off the speaker 
mr president , another point concerns actual customs checks by member states .
fr mr president , I am in two minds about whether to take the floor .
i am sorry for these points of order .
at the same time , discharge is also a political evaluation .
i would like most emphatically to draw your attention to the fact that not every error constitutes fraud .
certain member states did not even reach 32 % .
aids , malaria and tb still claim some four million lives a year .
we have close on a billion illiterate people in the developing world .
whenever I visit the developing world , I am struck by the intelligent and willing young people I meet .
investing in education is the key to this .
we are not talking about parliament's money , but taxpayersmoney .
what could the problem be here ?
we will return to these in next year's report .
institutional independence is an important guarantee of a properly functioning internal control system .
there were improvements in 2009 in this regard .
i should like to raise a few issues .
rapporteur mr liberadzki sets forth the new options very clearly in a number of paragraphs .
the council will say fair enough , but there are practical objections .
are you prepared to give an answer already as to whether or not you will comply with this ?
this is most encouraging .
however , a great deal needs to be done .
in some areas , there has even been some progress compared with 200however , there are still too many areas for which we must say that things are not acceptable .
part of this is due to errors and omissions part to fraud and misappropriation .
we know all the excuses .
i agree with those who say that fundamental structural changes are needed to change this situation .
we must therefore use the discharge to push through such changes .
in april last year , parliament refused to discharge the council's accounts for 2007 by a large majority .
let me give a specific example .
which countries are benefiting from it ?
would any board of directors approve the management of a company in such a state of affairs ?
of course not .
is discharge an interinstitutional game , as has been said in the past ?
mr czarnecki , I ask you to take the floor on a point of order .
you were right when you said that mr lópez garrido is on the list of speakers .
we shall see .
so , the solutions are on the table .
mr geier , mrs gräßle , it is time that you also allowed this solution here in the house .
that is what mr gerbrandy said .
that is what the council would like to point out with regard to the debate held this morning .
that gives me cause to say that the commission never receives a formal invitation to this sitting either .
in this respect , I should like to thank you again very much .
i also propose shortening the deadlines .
can you believe that this is april 2010 and we are talking about the 2008 accounts ?
the deadlines have to be shortened .
i propose a study on the consolidated accounts .
we will not grant discharge to the council , either today or next month .
as mr audy has pointed out , we must develop our tools .
whether or not it is efficient is another matter altogether .
we want 100 % of the money back .
this is not acceptable and we must deal with it .
i am pleased that mrs mathieu has recommended a postponement of discharge for the european police college accounts .
we will support that recommendation , as olaf needs more time to conclude its investigation .
my party will look particularly carefully at how labour and liberal democrat meps decide to vote on this issue .
anyone who is serious about reforming this system and about protecting the taxpayer should vote against granting discharge .
we are still not doing enough to simplify the rules , particularly those for the structural funds .
independent , external verification within the commission's impact assessment board is truly indispensable .
as we are such large institutions , we need buildings and they must be planned carefully and transparently .
applause 
self criticism is good , but it should then be accurate .
there are proposals that are already a reality .
we could re table them , but why ?
nothing should be more obvious .
we here in parliament have a particular responsibility in this respect .
i submitted a number of amendments to the committee , which were dealt with relatively benevolently by the rapporteur .
unfortunately , that is not currently the case .
what have they done ?
therefore , I would urge you to support amendment 33 to paragraph 65 on this subject .
this phenomenon is especially flagrant , in my opinion , among middle and higher level managerial staff .
the causes of these shortcomings are both objective and subjective .
rather support turkey's accession according to the accession criteria that the community itself has set .
i would therefore like to thank mr staes for such a constructive piece of work .
that is , of course , a good thing .
this is a high risk area and good amendments have also been proposed in this respect .
instead , we should ensure that we have only one seat .
i have every confidence in this happening .
there are also some recommendations within the report that are already included in the 2011 budget proposals .
my second request regards budgetary control .
in this regard , we urge the commission to produce recommendations on drafting these management statements .
the latest special report by the court of auditors reveals major problems .
this also includes the new european asylum support office .
the european commission has therefore established programmes that we cannot monitor and whose effectiveness we cannot check .
it is also about us handling european citizenstax money properly .
the issue of the role of internal audits and internal controls was raised by mrs herczog .
the third time it has been harder .
that is my basic position .
the council was granted discharge only in november .
in this respect , the perception that we are on the road to improvement is certainly not wrong .
the vote will take place during the may part session .
firstly , the new statute for assistants , which is in place at long last following years of discussion .
the abuses that existed have now been virtually eliminated .
action has been taken and clear and precise rules introduced in this field , too .
the sitting was suspended at 12.00 and resumed at 15.00 
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting see minutes
swift debate 
that , moreover , is precisely what european legislation permits .
i would like to thank the rapporteur , mrs hennis plasschaert , for the very constructive cooperation we have had .
the commission has tried to liaise with her and the co rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs in this matter .
we have tried to take on board the concerns expressed in the european parliament resolutions .
there will be reciprocity .
but we also need to be realistic here .
in conclusion , I believe that the draft mandate is a true substantial improvement .
this is what we shall be discussing today in this chamber .
after the vote in february , two clear lessons were learnt .
it needs to be faced .
we want to go there to show the us authorities that we mean business .
quality must come before timeframe .
i am sure there are no disadvantages to this and that the united states would be understanding .
the transmission of information to third countries must be regulated with clear directives .
we need an ambitious mandate with our demands .
how can that work ?
it marks a huge departure from eu legislation and practice .
america bears a vastly disproportionate burden worldwide for securing the liberty of us all .
the us privacy act still discriminates against non us citizens even commission officials admit that .
yes , a european authority should be able to have actual control over the data that will be transferred .
we want a good partnership with our american friends , above all , in the area of security .
we in our group are not looking for problems , but fighting for solutions .
i therefore invite you to come on board .
help us negotiate and together , we will bring about a good result .
i think it is important to state this , before going any further .
i want to say something on process and something on context .
this parliament is concerned about fundamental rights and the protection of citizensprivacy and also about data protection .
these are fundamental rights , and a simple cost benefit analysis is inappropriate where these are concerned .
pl mr president , the united states is the only world superpower today .
it was only thanks to the us that free europe was free for 40 years .
i think such political will should be present here .
parliament now has greater opportunity to make demands as regards the content of the agreement .
they concern our freedoms and civil rights , and that is the basis of the rule of law .
that is why we cannot allow the mass transmission of data without restrictions .
it is claimed that there are technical problems inherent in this .
the reasons for the refusal were clearly listed and they include in particular 
i reiterate that there needs to be absolute respect for the principles of necessity , proportionality and reciprocity .
the european parliament will be consistent with the positions it has always held .
the fight against terrorism is our priority .
we need very good reasons if we are to sayyesthis time .
the principles of proportionality and effectiveness are paramount .
also , will the united states really do the same for us ?
council and commission , what form do you see this kind of public eu body taking ?
i should like to hear your responses .
respect among partners , respect for citizens and respect for european legislation .
i am confident that the commission will resolve this in a sensible manner .
therefore , and let us say it directly , our position is potentially a form of political pressure .
the focus should only be on terrorism .
the current plans are disproportionate in my view .
that is why several questions need to be asked .
is it not possible to reduce their retention period to a more reasonable length of time ?
the previous agreement stipulated a maximum period of 90 years .
is there an intended use for these data other than that of combating terrorism , and what is it ?
i should like the council and the commission to answer these questions .
i feel it is wise , therefore , to think about the best way of enforcing these conditions .
it is up to parliament to make this one of its prerogatives .
anti americanism is not a common cause in europe .
however , the transfer of aggregate data is certainly going overboard .
unfortunately , the council presidency was conspicuous by its absence .
population groups associated with terrorism at a particular time could be targeted .
i would call it common sense .
we must now join forces in order to adopt a new , definitive agreement .
it is our credibility that is at stake here .
it is not about that .
data must always be retained with an objective and in relation to a specific person .
mr coelho , for example , who is not here at the moment , expressed this in some detail .
there will be absolute reciprocity with regard to the united states .
the eu review team will also have access to this information .
but it is as the council also said a very important part of the negotiation .
the whole deal is only for terrorism purposes .
the rest will remain anonymous .
so this is a parallel discussion .
we will communicate that to the ministers .
it will be a difficult negotiation and we need the time .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 149 
they use such data to combat terrorism and other serious crimes .
for practical reasons , it was not possible to do this before september 200however , this does not diminish the level of protection of pnr data transferred to canada .
i am looking forward to working further with you on these issues .
as regards the use of pnr data , we should also include serious crime .
in my opinion , this would also contribute to protecting the personal rights of those affected .
madam president , there are a few basic things I would like to say about this agreement .
i will go into the details once more shortly .
now however , it is also about serious crime .
this can be discussed .
however , we must go into great detail here .
officially , we still do not have these results yet .
it is very important to create a uniform agreement .
the issue of data must be reviewed again .
this is really the key to everything .
we need to make very clear what it is that we are talking about .
it is our prime responsibility to represent the interests of our own european citizens .
they have a right to know that we uphold european law in international relations and in our internal policies .
i do not know whether you have ever seen the film minority report .
great !
madam president , I am not an illustrious film critic , as the previous speaker is .
i would not like our debate to be a debate about cinema .
this can be a matter of life and death for these people .
therefore , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur of this resolution for her work on this dossier .
both are important , of course , and a careful balance needs to be struck between them .
just about everyone will travel by air sooner or later .
these must be opened to european citizens .
the way to legal action must likewise stand open to them .
that happened last year before christmas .
the problem is getting the data to where we need it in order to prevent threats .
instead , there was the proposal to build new data sets and gather new data .
what action will you take to prevent pnr data being used in the profiling and definition of risk factors ?
to this , I would like to add that no data collection system is sufficient in itself .
we cannot prevent attempted terrorist attacks without sound data exchange and cooperation of the intelligence services .
i believe the principles we discussed then and agreed upon should be present here .
hopefully , we will have good results .
i have listened carefully to the debate .
i have read your resolution .
the debate is closed .
is this a worthy goal ?
are there any mining technologies that endanger our waters and our environment ?
i believe that , given the seriousness of the matter , this is absolutely justified .
clear information requirements are included in the directive if trans boundary impacts are expected .
this legislation also incorporates requirements for the closure of extraction facilities , and for after closure .
the same amount can be obtained through the recycling of approximately 5 kg of old mobile phones .
however , I believe the commission should draw further conclusions in view of this very dangerous technology .
a great deal of poison will be released into the environment .
the expected lifetime of the mine is only 20 years , and it will create scarcely any jobs .
there is no guarantee that the investor will restore the environment after the mining is finished .
also , there is the question of the turkish shores and the related threats to the aegean .
there are also similar plans in other countries .
however , hungary , as we already know , decided just last december to ban all cyanide based mining work .
we are certain that citizens will obviously react , but we too must act .
it gets into the organism by inhalation through undamaged skin or after use .
let us take the example of the roşia montană mining development in alba county .
in addition , there is not even any european legislation on air quality for such emissions .
there are regulations , standards and norms in place to prevent accidents .
why ?
continuing to mobilise public opinion in europe is also part of our mission .
bacteria based extraction would be more nature friendly , but it is not yet used for gold .
in this area , there can be no question of small or large risk .
technology is also significant there .
we must be aware of the fact that we are in the process of developing new technologies .
toxic , hazardous substances are used in many industrial processes other than mining .
however , their causes were similar tailing ponds which collapsed .
in germany environmental technologies were developed that will help to avoid cyanide in the future .
despite this , the law in many european countries still allows the use of such techniques .
however , substances are used on our planet which are thousands of times more toxic than cyanides .
generally speaking , if chemical substances enter water , they destroy life .
mr president , with all due respect , can I say that this debate is largely misdirected .
the subject before us is a very curious matter .
and why now ?
i find the whole matter unjustified .
that was a translation error .
it is therefore extremely important that the directive is duly implemented .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place during the may I part session .
written statements rule 149 
we must not forget the details of this disaster , which has become synonymous internationally with pollution .

τhe next item is the vote .
mr president , I , too , heard about the meeting between president buzek and mr zapatero .
the council has consistently refused to enter into such an agreement .
for outcome of the vote and other details see minutes 
this type of data must be used only with the goal of preventing and combating tax offences .
the adoption of this report is also another step in the fight against fraud and tax evasion .
given the open market and the movement of services , nothing else would be reasonable .
this report provides an exhaustive analysis of the budgetary situation of the european court of justice ecj .
i believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public .
i believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public .
therefore , they must objectively and rigorously account for how public funds have been used .
that is essential for building people's trust in public office holders .
that is why I voted for the report on the translation centre for the bodies of the european union .
that is why I voted for the report on the european centre for the development of vocational training .
i believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public .
that is why I voted for the report on the community fisheries control agency .
i argue that it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public .
that is why I voted for the report on the european aviation safety agency .
that is why I voted for the report on the european centre for disease prevention and control .
i believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public .
i believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public .
that is why I voted for the report on the european food safety authority .
i believe that it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public .
i join the rapporteur in congratulating the agency on having put in place sophisticated activity based budgeting and user satisfaction monitoring .
that is why I voted for the report on the european medicines agency .
that is why I voted for the report on the european maritime safety agency .
these deficiencies must therefore be overcome .
i believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public .
that is why I voted for the report on the european agency for safety and health at work .
i believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public .
i believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public .
that is why I voted for the report on the sesar joint undertaking .
for these reasons , I voted in favour of the report .
each individual member state decides on the methods for financing and applying aviation security .
we voted for this report because of our opposition to this situation .
for these reasons , this proposal is to be welcomed .
in writing . I voted yes to the report .
i voted for the adoption of these amendments .
it is estimated that they will be finalised by the end of next year .
in writing . I voted in favour of this report even though our amendment was not adopted .
it is also markedly technical .
it is therefore important to ensure european cooperation and carefully select priority projects .
the ten t is intended to link land , sea and air transport networks throughout europe by 20the main objective is to ensure fast and easy movement of people and goods among member states .
the most important thing is passenger safety and protection .
however , the ten t may be used to create jobs and observe social and economic cohesion .
free movement of people and goods is what defines the eu .
this is only possible with a good ten t .
economic forecasts predict a major reduction in eu growth of 1.1 % in 20in this context , this report represents a reaction to the financial crisis and its socioeconomic repercussions .
a threshold of eur 50 million should apply , instead of the current eur 25 million .
even in times of crisis let us fight for equal conditions in equivalent situations !
the report takes account of this and I therefore support its adoption .
in times of crisis , the eu is once again showing its true colours .
eu subsidies have even been adjusted accordingly .
i have therefore rejected the proposal .
i feel that the baltic states have suffered the most painful blow .
severe measures were taken because of the financial hurricane and jobs were lost .
it helps to fund measures like the regeneration of industrial areas affected by the reduction of towns and villages .
the commission is seeking to change them formally by means of itsomnibusproposal .
i therefore support this house's motion for a resolution .
the commission and the council must urgently make the necessary changes in light of the new legislative framework .
for this reason , I voted in favour of the adoption of the report .
in view of the absence of members , this normally means 60 % of those voting .
the competitiveness of european maritime transport should remain one of the strategic objectives of european union maritime transport policy .
the democratic movement delegation welcomes the adoption of strategic goals for the eu's maritime transport until 20it must be realised that the european maritime sector mainly operates and competes in a global market .
that is why I am voting against this text .
the european parliament is one of the defenders of maritime policy in the eu .
currently , only 5 % of europe's cultural heritage is available in digitised form .
this is why I endorsed mrs trüpel's report .
however , compliance with these standards must not put european producers at a disadvantage in the european market .
the truth is that these standards entail operating , financial and administrative costs for the eu's farmers .
nevertheless , these objectives absolutely must not be a pretext for weakening agriculture in the eu .
i therefore voted for this report because it respects these balances .
in writing . I gave my full support to this report .
the new cap , thus , will have to meet growing public demand for a more sustainable agricultural policy .
agriculture is dealt a double blow by climate change .
it is the first to suffer the increase in droughts and natural disasters .
nitrogen fertilisers used by farmers are significant emitters of comethane from animal faeces is also a renewable source of energy .
there will have to be a place for them in future agricultural policy .
we believe that the member states should continue to make the decisions on matters relating to forestry policy .
however , agriculture can also contribute to combating climate change and has great potential for sustainable development .
we need to move towards more sustainable agriculture , which means greater efficiency .
the danish social democrats voted in favour of the report on agriculture and climate change .
that depends on respect for human beings and for our ecosystem .
all initiatives that aim to reduce global warming are welcome .
let us not forget that the agricultural sector is responsible for almost 10 % of co2 emissions .
it is therefore necessary to build on the sustainable aspect of agriculture .
the reason for this is that mr le foll advocates a common forestry policy .
a technical error was made by the group .
i voted in favour of stéphane le foll's report .
i am resolutely confident that the cap will become more sustainable over time .
i support an environmentally friendly common agricultural policy !
there needs to be a thorough analysis of the economic benefit .
eu expansion had a great impact on eu agriculture .
it is absolutely paramount to focus this support in the areas most affected by land abandonment .
of course , all measures must be based on an eu framework .
the reason for me taking this position is evident from the report .
the management of agricultural aid should be handled by the member states .
they have the local knowledge .
this is why we need to speed up the investments towards this .
for all these reasons , I voted in favour of this report .
to attain those goals it is necessary the significantly reduce digital literacy and competence gaps by 20in order to have a competitive digital agenda we must start from the people .
i support the excellent report on the new digital agenda by mrs del castillo vera .
adigital agendais increasingly important and unavoidable in our society .
i support the measures to that effect and have therefore voted in favour of this report .
europe continues to be a global leader in the field of advanced information and communication technologies ict .
that is why we voted against the majority of these texts on budget discharge .
the number of errors has fallen , but we have still not reached thetolerable error level.
they also supported recommendations in relation to providing information to european taxpayers about parliament's use of public money .
moreover , a great deal of support has been shown for this critical report across many groups in parliament .
the european parliament recently debated a resolution concerning blatant human rights violations in cuba .
the situation ended in the death of people who were exercising their right to free expression .
brazil will be the last brics to meet the eu in a summit .
this text , which is of an arrogant and imperial nature , is not acceptable .
there are already multilateral organisations such as the united nations for this sort of dialogue .
i therefore abstained during the final vote .
together we must conserve the environment , save natural resources and also fight poverty , inequality and migration .
in writing . I abstained on the final vote on this report .
guaranteeing reciprocity in bilateral relations is one of the european union's basic principles .
canada has a history of partnership with the eu .
the text is largely sound , but it contains two paragraphs that I simply cannot support .
there should be an appropriate eu appointed authority to monitor the implementation of these measures .
the european parliament is aware that this agreement is important even for europeanssecurity .
the european parliament has acquired greater decision making powers through the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon .
the issue of the protection of personal data is an important one for the european parliament .
therefore , we have been very vigilant as regards the issue of transferring air passenger data .
the agreement needs to be limited in duration and liable for immediate termination should any obligation not be met .
this agreement must be permanently on parliament's radar .
international legal cooperation and transatlantic cooperation are fundamental to the fight against terrorism .
there is a different understanding of data protection , competencies , legislation and privacy where eu us relations are concerned .
these issues need to be clarified before the commission is given a new mandate .
there has never been a better time for europe to assert its independence from the united states .
that is very much to be welcomed .
i shall vote in favour of this text .
however , they must never be used as a pretext for repressing fundamental freedoms .
passenger name records pnr are another weapon in the fight against terrorism .
the union will not , however , endanger civil liberties and fundamental rights .
i support the amendment aimed at removing paragraph 4 contained in the draft resolution voted on today .
however , I voted against the draft resolution for a number of reasons .
as an mep , I support the opportunity being offered to this area with all its problems .
there is nothing to stop an accident such as this from happening again .
european environmental legislation enshrines the precautionary principle and requires the prevention and monitoring of water pollution .
this issue concerns numerous countries , the health of european citizens and environmental protection .
also , all member states should undertake to ban the use of cyanide , as hungary did recently .
it poses a serious threat to the environment and human health .
this principle applies to mining technology as well .
we do not have the right to ban , but we do have the right to protect .
in writing . I voted in favour of the final text .
this is standard practice in europe and minimises the risk of hazardous emissions .

i officially opened parliament's new liaison office with the united states congress in washington .
we expect cooperation with the united states to take place on equal terms .
this sunday , 9 may , is the 60th anniversary of the schumann declaration .
the next item is the joint debate on the following 
der sommer war sehr groß ..
we are in favour of holding the intergovernmental conference we are against calling a convention .
therefore , the citizens of these countries will be even better represented in the european parliament .
we therefore support what has already been said .
nevertheless , the treaty itself requires that a convention be held to revise the treaty .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we have a broad consensus on this matter .
we want to create the conditions for this now so that they can come and work together with us .
it concerns the question of who decides who these new members will be .
such a convention would merely serve to waste time and taxpayersmoney .
we should be prudent with public money at all times .
mr president , we disagree on many things where the eu is concerned .
we doubtless also disagree on many things where the european parliament is concerned .
i also think it is a very unfortunate development .
we would therefore have to revise the treaty .
mr president , there is something bizarre about the situation that we find ourselves in right now .
like the previous speaker , I therefore have to say that my group cannot support these reports .
it is not at all impossible to stick to the election .
indeed , we must take the quickest path , because at this stage there is little to discuss .
i see no need to convene a convention .
the ball is therefore back in the council's court .
a further complication is that the treaty stipulates the total number of meps shall not exceed 7i urge this house to oppose this proposal .
madam president , I strongly disagree with the previous speaker .
however , we must insist that france fulfils its obligations just as its european partners have .
after many years of work and quite serious ratification problems , the treaty of lisbon is finally in force .
we must take this opportunity seriously and base our actions on these acquired institutional reforms .
therefore , this revision of protocol no 36 is worthwhile .
we must not force them to wait any longer .
clear steps forward have been taken .
this view is shared by others who matter .
we have to say loud and clear that the doubters are wrong .
i will come back to this in a moment .
there are three main building blocks to be considered .
the case for reinforcement of both the preventive and the corrective arm of the pact is obvious .
i also believe we need to look at the other causes of imbalances .
after all , it is better to be safe than sorry .
we cannot have a standstill .
these reforms will be introduced against the background of unprecedented efforts already under way .
one must bear in mind that financial market players are key actors in driving market sentiment .
we need responsible behaviour from all our market players .
we have already been doing a lot as regards financial markets reform .
i count on this house to make this clear to all .
this work must be speeded up .
we are also now considering whether further specific measures are needed for sovereign derivatives markets .
we must get our own house in order while pushing others to do the same .
the commission will do whatever is necessary to ensure that financial markets are not a playground for speculation .
we have high hopes that the impasse in greece will be broken .
i do not think so .
these answers are not about courting popular opinion , but about being responsible and sensible .
they seized their political courage with both hands to respond to the crucial issues that arose .
what will become of our euro ?
we share this responsibility jointly , and time will not stand still for us .
i will give you the floor in a few minutes .
in order to achieve all of these ambitious objectives , we must first learn to work together .
therefore , this system has to work , and it has to be supported .
it is clear that we have been drifting for four months .
those council members who are responsible should at least admit it !
they should say we are to blame ! it is us !
how much time does germany need to build up pensions ?
mr barroso knows something about this , since he lost elections in this way .
the treaties must be amended .
let us not wait for the council it is incapable of reaching a decision .
we can do it yes , we can .
let us do it .
in other words , a political initiative between greece and turkey aimed at disarmament .
let them disarm .
this is completely absurd a country with 11 million inhabitants has 100 000 soldiers !
ladies and gentlemen , I share the concern of the european people about current developments .
savers and pensioners , for example , are asking themselves where this is heading .
the question is whether or not greece will come out the other end .
it is providing neither stability nor , at present , economic growth .
for years , the financial markets have been increasingly deregulated and now everyone is surprised that it is expensive .
who will now pay the price for the political errors ?
banks are not being placed under any obligation .
with the dictates from the international monetary fund , any semblance of a democratic decision making process has been eliminated .
of course , greece must also do its homework .
i will therefore omit the facts in this regard and endorse what he said in his speech .
violence will achieve the opposite of what the protesters and honest demonstrators want .
we must call for an end to the violence .
mr president , thank you very much .
these are dangerous times .
greece is one of them it is the tip of the iceberg .
let me remind you that greece has been the largest net beneficiary of european funds for years .
immigration has run riot whilst you have looked on and done nothing .
el mr president , thank you .
thank you for the responsible debate which we have had , today , in this chamber .
it seems there are no limits for the leaders of the euro area .
europe 2020 new european strategy for jobs and growth debate 
this is the dual challenge contained in the europe 2020 strategy .
firstly , the structure of the europe 2020 strategy has some integrated guidelines .
or we could increase european cooperation in an effective way , using all the tools at our disposal .
we have to address globally some of the imbalances that were at the origin of this crisis .
it is important that europe presents a coordinated approach to the ganother objective will be driving on with financial market reform .
a global agreement on bank stability levies , linked to concrete resolution measures , would send a strong signal .
better coordination of our economic policies is the centre piece of europe 20even before this greek crisis we were suggesting and proposing more coordination of economic policies .
i am also strongly committed to getting a numerical target on the fight against poverty and social exclusion .
europe 2020 must be a balanced programme .
they reflect the priorities of the europe 2020 strategy .
i think this is progress .
thus , things must be done differently with the eu 2020 strategy .
parliament will challenge you to do so if need be .
is that change , though , mr barroso ?
as you well know , mr barroso , we are not as rich as all that .
this is not our vision of the future .
let me make a comparison .
let me take some examples .
we negotiated the economic recovery plan .
the most cost effective means to reduce greenhouse gases is to move forward with a strategy for energy efficiency .
we need the promised energy efficiency action plan , promised for so long .
we will put forward a bold resolution on the second step of the 2020 strategy .
in the paper that you presented , I still cannot see a vision of what is to happen now .
there is a great deal of work to be done on this programme .
mr barroso has to manoeuvre artfully between these propositions .
i am not , of course , a free market fanatic .
there is also no doubt that we must help greece .
for us poles , whom I represent here , the wordsolidarityhas great significance .
we have provided no clarification with regard to the future development of the european union .
sovereignty also means taking responsibility , and consequently taking responsibility for the wrong finance policy .
centralistic economic governance from brussels dictating the european standard would surely be the wrong way to go .
that is the best european good governance we can have .
this is also evident in the proposals that we social democrats are responsible for .
it is important for the summit to make clear commitments not to put europe into low energy mode .
it is important to keep demand high and to stimulate investment .
personally , I am very disappointed with the equality sham that the last council presented after its meeting .
secondly , we need to start changing into climate smart societies .
there are winners in this kind of policy , but there are also many losers .
some people say that they do not like the definition .
to these people I would say that they should not let technicalities stand in the way .
you will receive that next week in conjunction with professor monti's report .
it is hardly mentioned in this document .
it is time to prioritise social sustainability .
however , we cannot blame workers , smallholders or entrepreneurs for this situation .
that is true .
it is more like a reflection put to paper that is now being steamrollered through in a fast tracked procedure .
this would not surprise me , because we cannot achieve a change in this way .
the standard must be a forward looking perspective .
therefore , commissioner , it is most disappointing that 11 countries will not be present on friday .
first of all choose democracy .
how does the council actually define employment ?
thirdly choose sound public spending .
fifthly choose poverty reduction .
ro sustainable economic growth requires huge , steady investment in the transport sector as well .
ro during the last two years , we have faced the most severe global economic crisis .
cs the european union represents the largest geopolitical entity in the world in terms of population .
in this context I consider it key to retain the strategic focus particularly on economic growth and jobs .
the fightback by the greek working class should be supported by workers all over europe .
europe 2020 is not our goal .
europe 2020 must set in motion specific projects for growth , employment , research , innovation and sustainable competitiveness .
i also fail to see a tangible desire to identify priorities .
therefore , it cannot disregard social cohesion , one of the fundamental factors of competitiveness .
this is so that we do not find ourselves in any situation of extreme circumstances .
that has been completely lost .
there are many indications that the utopian and socialist 2020 project will share the fate of the lisbon strategy .
secondly , this is capital investment in transport , energy and telecommunications infrastructures .
thirdly , this is public expenditure through the european budget .
unemployment is constantly rising .
already , millions of europeans are jobless , and the figure is rising from one day to the next .
it is simply a question of carrying out this planning .
we therefore need to consider how we can make this european market serve the people .
many fellow members have already gone into the details .
this is the only way of enabling us to have a really effective internal market .
i welcome the efforts made by the commission to present this communication to us .
interdependence among economies shows the need for cohesion and ensuring [ . ]
the president cut off the speaker 
he will now miss one of the most important measures .
it was with great sadness that I learnt of the deaths in greece it is very sad .
there is no question of sustainability .
my electorate and myself are of the opinion that between the two value systems we have to choose sustainability .
why did the lisbon strategy fail ?
it is also something that the treaty of lisbon requires us to do .
financial stability is necessary for europe's ongoing economic recovery for sustainable growth and job creation .
all euro area member states are taking measures to consolidate their public finances , not least portugal and spain .
i am confident that we will succeed and overcome the formidable challenges .
why so ?
the vote will take place during the second part session in may .
this can be achieved by high quality education and training , operated through coordination at member state level .
a convincing european strategy to create a stronger europe should take leadership on global level .
the quality of education in european schools and universities must rise in keeping with the labour market's requirements .
development , however , must not mean merely aiding those european regions that already perform above average .
the best stewards of the european countryside are the agricultural producers themselves .
the eu 2020 strategy cannot succeed without the cohesion policy , either .
the commission must take the driving seat and lead this process .
the transport sector generates about 10 % of the european union's gdp and provides over 10 million jobs .
i am sure that we can enlarge the trans european railway corridor network by 20the sitting is resumed .
in many cases it goes beyond .
the accession should therefore preserve the substantive and procedural features of that system .
however , the accession must meet two requirements .
this is what we are going to adopt now .
this will guarantee the independent external monitoring of the eu's respect for people's fundamental rights and freedoms .
at the same time , several questions need to be clarified during the negotiations .
es thank you very much for the very hard but necessary work that you have done .
why do we need it ?
romania signed the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in 199i would also reinforce what mr sógor mentioned .
i would like to give a very relevant example .
this is a bizarre and downright scandalous situation .
i would like to ask the following question will accession to the framework convention change anything ?
the debate is closed .
i could cite quite a few recent examples of that .
finally , accession provides the eu with additional credibility in its foreign relations .
on the other hand , we must be aware that there are a number of questions expecting an answer .
what role will parliament play in appointing the eu judge to the echr ?
i firmly believe that all these questions will be answered soon .
conformity of legal acts with the text of the convention will come under the supervision of the court .
although the recovery is small , ultimately it is recovery , and in particular it must mean industrial activity .
i shall end with a question to mr tajani .
however electric propulsion technology is the most developed .
the manufacturers have a large variety of models , and they are soon going to begin marketing them .
we should all pull together and the commission should certainly take the lead in this .
secondly , we need to extend network infrastructure coverage to all areas .
car manufacturers that are currently carrying out fleet calculations cannot yet include electric cars .
only then shall we in the group of the greens / european free alliance be able to support electromobility .
replacing the current car fleet with electric cars will neither resolve the problem of congestion nor protect the climate .
therefore , the number of cars must be reduced .
if that turns out to be electromobility , we shall need european and international standardisation .
in my opinion , this is how we should approach the issue of standardising electric vehicles .
pressure for innovation should come not from regulations but from demand .
by the way , the electric bicycle I ride was made in china .
many of the issues that I wanted to mention have already been raised here .
nothing much has changed since then .
i have nothing against environmental friendliness , but these days the environment has been rendered unaffordable by leftist politicians .
the batteries and their life are still far too limited and contain extremely harmful substances .
this issue has already been mentioned here , but it cannot be overstated .
it is not too late to avoid that .
the technology will choose itself .
the standards will be available only in 2012 and will perhaps begin to apply as late as 20might I suggest that you do your best to speed that up ?
standardisation of vehicles and ensuring their universal operability in the european market is essential .
pt mr president , I welcome the recent communication on clean and efficient vehicles .
it is also important that tax incentives be created , with appropriate electricity prices for consumers .
my country , the netherlands , has made a choice .
now , that is european thinking and together we are going ahead with mennekessix pole plug .
we actually need to follow that line of thinking and link up our best technologies .
alternative fuel vehicles are a winning idea the fact that their market share almost doubled in 2008 proves it .
however , they still account for only 1.3 % of all vehicles registered .
nevertheless , they will never come close to replacing all the current , fossil fuel powered vehicles .
the car based society as we know it today has thus been given a suspended sentence .
speaking of advantages , I believe that there are two key aspects of electric vehicles which offer considerable advantages .
one is technology and the other energy .
as far as technology goes , electric vehicle technology already exists .
what is more , the technology used by electric vehicles is the most efficient and best for the environment .
electric vehicles help renewable energies , which have a weak spot they are irregular .
electric vehicles compensate for this irregularity through their own special features .
she raised the issue of lithium , along with other meps who have spoken about batteries during this debate .
we are more competitive if we focus on innovation and research .
however , their development must be included as part of a future policy on sustainable mobility .
green cars offer significant benefits .
the next item is one minute speeches under rule 1i hope that this initiative will be welcomed by the majority of this house .
regrettably , the european union is finding it difficult to develop a common strategy against the economic crisis .
their struggle is there to demonstrate this .
whilst it remains in the eurozone , greece has no way out .
do not make the greek people pay the price for the unattainable ambition of an eu superstate !
de mr president , I would like to talk today about the subject of air safety .
eighty per cent of the region's population are poles .
however , the real issue here is that the information coming from the bolivian authorities cannot be trusted .
bg I must draw your attention to a problem in my country .
politicians are being arrested in a brutal and blatant manner or ridiculous charges are being made .
for years on end bulgaria was required to make greater efforts in the fight against crime .
the leaders of european states pretend that nothing is going on .
thank you .
i would like to highlight two such ideas that could result in meaningful instruments .
they are right .
we cannot put off this decision any longer .
the european union must immediately and officially commit to a 30 % reduction in emissions by 20we can also do much more in parliament .
we need to set an example to the member states by reducing our footprint by 50 % .
the irregularity rate for the eu funds paid out has never been as low as in this year .
that concludes this item .
there is also a need to ensure that the small and medium sized players in this market enjoy favourable conditions .
we cannot forget the importance of smes as job providers and as suppliers of proximity .
there is nothing in your analysis whatsoever that has picked up any of that .
what are the main conclusions of this long consultation process ?
first , we learned something positive that consumers in europe enjoy vigorous competition in the car sales market .
let me stress that multi branding exists and will continue to exist where market reality calls for it .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have now heard a great deal .
hopefully , we shall in future see an equally positive development on the after sales market .
guarantees of access to technical information are needed .
commissioner , competition is not an end in itself .
this includes , firstly , genuine authorisation for multi branding .
it includes allowing workshops and dealerships to have unrestricted access to information on vehicles and repair options .
thirdly , it includes providing the necessary opportunities for gaining qualifications .
they also need to be in a position to maintain electric cars .
fourthly , they need investment security , in other words contractual protection and no more revisions .
they need to be able to make safe investments over a long period .
regulation ec no 1400 / 2002 reduced this discrepancy .
local garage owners cannot pose a threat to free competition in europe .
the position and the reasoning behind the abolition of the exemption regulation are misguided .
i can only repeat the plea that I made to the president of the commission back in spring 200we have the problem of different national regulations if only single branding remains .
please stand up for small and medium sized enterprises , too .
multi branding is part of competition and helps to protect consumers .
most of these are family owned enterprises in local towns and local villages .
the aim of any regulation or decision regarding competition is to benefit the consumer .
they can probably do it more easily now than at any time in the past .
the current proposal by the commission improves all of that .
all that is improved .
i mean everybody's opinions , including yours , of course .
have they increased or declined in number ?
what has been happening up until now or is still happening with certain garages and certain spare parts manufacturers ?
finally , the deadlines for cancellation .
it is important to listen to people's views , but it is also important to learn from experience .
written statements rule 149 
this regulation brought in advantageous operating conditions which strengthened competition in the automotive market .
i was all the more pleased to hear that the european commission has decided to prolong this regulation .
differences exist in the acquisition of cancer data , too .
a close relationship between doctor and patient is not enough .
this underlines the potential of the european partnership for action against cancer .
the success of the partnership largely depends on the active participation of its numerous and diverse partners .
by the end of the partnership , the objective is for all member states to have integrated cancer plans .
some actions will build on the result of the good work done so far .
i share the concerns and anxieties expressed in the european commission communication and in the draft report .
the older the population , the more cases of cancer can be expected .
another point about which we can do something is the large number of carcinogenic substances in the environment .
stress , lifestyle , chemicals and viruses can also cause cancer .
this year , almost two million european citizens are expected to die of this disease .
nevertheless , cervical cancer can be practically eliminated by making vaccination and scanning programmes widely available .
ro I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the fine job he has done .
the european commission must allocate funds for research in this area .
the family should be a place of relief , support and encouragement for its members .
we must , of course , address the plague of cancer .
cancer is a global problem that continues to persist , despite medical advances .
the principle that prevention is better than cure has proven to be true here .
the most cost effective strategy with the best prospects of success is screening .
i wish them all the best , and my thoughts are with them .
therefore , we should increase our efforts to ensure that these high environmental standards are maintained .
this is something we must especially ensure accessibility to medicines that come onto the market .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
this is absolutely necessary for an effective preventive action .
of course , prevention can't be done without a proper level of financial resources .
at present cancer is the second biggest cause of death and illness in europe .
more cooperation and resources for the study of cancer and preventive treatment are very important .
in february 2010 the ict for energy efficiency forum was launched .
major european cities have signed up to the green digital charter .
protection of the communitiesfinancial interests fight against fraud annual report 2008 debate 
hence the report that we are presenting is the result of a highly coordinated effort .
the fall concerns all spending areas except direct expenditure and pre accession funds .
secondly , reducing the number of irregularities and significantly improving the regulations .
the structural funds is an area of particular concern both for the parliament and the commission .
considerable progress has been achieved concerning transparency about the beneficiaries of eu funds .
olaf and ias have been cooperating closely since 200olaf is willing to cooperate still more closely with the ias .
as the rapporteur points out , the financial impact of irregularities on structural actions has decreased significantly .
it is important for the commission and the member states to continue this fight as rigorously as possible .
from 2007 to 2008 there was a reduction in the negative financial effects of irregularities in all sectors .
for the period 2007 to 2013 , turkey will receive the sum of eur 4.84 billion .
we must put an end to this madness .
kyrgyzstan motions for resolutions tabled see minutes
european investment bank eib annual report 2008 debate 
this is the title of our current agenda item .
this is the continuation of a tradition begun a few years ago .
i welcome this excellent cooperation with parliament .
last year we lent more than eur 12 billion to the banks for small and medium sized enterprises .
the third area that we were asked to prioritise is the fight against climate change .
we will have the opportunity to discuss this with parliament .
the key element of this proposal is to make the system even more effective .
why is this so important ?
the committee welcomes the high capital adequacy ratio of the european investment bank eib .
it does not have it because it is an international entity that is not subject to national audit authorities .
commissioner , I would like you to support this idea .
it increased the money supply and ensured that the lending volume increased significantly .
these investments were able to alleviate the crisis significantly .
it is beneficial to the eu to have stable and economically strong neighbours .
so , finally I come to a blot on the eib's protocol .
this is something we can read about in its diversity strategy from december 200mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr maystadt , fellow countrymen , we need a bank like yours .
from that point of view , allow me to quote just one figure .
i think that this is how you will play your role as catalyst .
the increased financial commitment should be appreciated , here , as it is fairly significant in this area .
and what have such loans done for the european economy ?
electrolux is an example of eib success .
however , it is important to ensure that the businesspeople in question actually receive the loans .
this is the way in which these people work , by branding their political opponents as monsters .
to me it seems extremely important to continue to develop initiatives such as jeremie .
enterprises need equity , venture capital , guarantees , loans and the technical assistance proposed by jeremie .
we urgently need a european mechanism for financial stability .
i reject mr martin's assertion and , in my opinion , he should withdraw it .
my country , lithuania , is a case in point .
the support of the eif is of great importance in particular to small and medium sized enterprises in difficult times .
mr president , I would like to thank all the speakers for their comments .
of course , some of the issues raised deserve to be discussed in more detail .
mrs győri and mr schmidt , in particular , underlined this .
i think we are already the most supervised international financial institution .
he is right , we still have some progress to make in terms of gender equality .
the figure that he quoted concerns only managerial staff .
many of you have , understandably , referred to the situation in greece .
i , for one , am confident of your support in achieving this objective .
ukraine was mentioned , as well as the balkan regions .
i myself agree .
on such occasions it is usually the leaders of institutions who get the praise .
i have to tell you that what mr mölzer has said is untrue .
this is the man whose party mr mölzer belongs to and whom he works closely with .
this must be stopped before it gets out of hand .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place today at 11.00 .
in reacting to the crisis , the eib significantly increased its lending volume to businesses in 200the positive role played by the eib during the crisis is incontrovertible .
mass atrocities in jos , nigeria , in january and march debate 
the eu was amongst the first of nigeria's international partners to make public its views on the violence .
it is apparent , however , that the conflict always involves extremely poor people .
the two most important sectors are peace and security , and governance and human rights .
there are social , political and economic factors that must be considered before we reach conclusions .
the killings are similar in method and consequence to previous clashes in 2001 , 2004 and 200violence has been used in the past to settle differences and has once again triumphed over dialogue .
most importantly , the region suffers from scarce resources and the unequal access of different groups to these resources .
his death comes at a time when the division between muslims and christians is taking a particularly dreadful turn .
that it is the result , among others , of the political authoritiesinability to overcome corruption .
what can the european union do in such circumstances ?
we will do that in the present resolution .
some have been waiting to be tried for 10 years .
they will be repeated in the future unless something is done .
violence still erupts almost daily and christians , in particular , are at the receiving end .
secondly , it must bring the perpetrators to justice .
there is talk of over 500 deaths in the past three months .
in this case we must support the resolution and also what mrs vergiat has said .
it does go far enough , but it is important that the eu stands for human rights .
as you are aware , at the beginning of this year , more than 300 muslims were massacred .
the international community needs to be specifically involved once again .
the alternative is indeed a break up of nigeria and further barbaric horrors inflicted on the people .
so there are very many differences and we must not treat these events as clear examples of religious persecution .
i think it is important to refer to their own documents .
i would like to raise two points in my speech .
in other words , there is never any sign of public accountability for the crimes committed .
member of the commission . mr president , thank you for a very serious and responsible debate today .
many of you have highlighted the complexity of societal problems in nigeria .
written statements rule 149 
it should be remembered that this is not the first time such terrible events have taken place in jos .

however , I have some reservations about how this parliament and the eu legislate on this matter .
if they do not , we are a disgrace .
consumers have a right to buy not only healthy food , but also food which has been produced healthily .
de mr president , I would like to make three brief remarks about the report .
firstly , agriculture is not the problem in the case of climate change , it is the solution .
mr president , I hope everybody in the visitorsgallery is impressed !
explanations of vote continuation 
the wordcyanideis synonymous withdeath.
i abstained on the resolution on kyrgyzstan .
this in itself is quite understandable since health affects all of us and those closest to us .
the incidence of some kinds of cancer can be predicted by genetic predisposition , lifestyle and so on .
therefore the initiative of the commission to use ict to meet eu 2020 goals should be applauded .
i represent southern italy , which is located in the south of europe in the mediterranean basin .
obviously it is very difficult to speak with all this confusion in any case I am finishing .
mr president , I support the commission's white paper and the report by mr prodi .
i think that such a white paper is especially needed in the aftermath of the copenhagen climate change talks .
de mr president , I support the motion which mr prodi has tabled today .
vice president biden's visit to the european union today demonstrates this commitment .
in america , after one year under president obama's leadership , there is new hope for the world .
the floor is yours .
let me state it as plainly as I can .
so have no doubt about that .
applause 
that is why we will do everything we can to support this great endeavour of yours .
climate change one of the greatest threats our planet faces .
applause 
in the face of the threat iran poses , we are committed to the security of our allies .
the world has changed .
the scourge has no respect for borders none .
on a personal level , I have , for 36 years of my career , defended privacy rights .
but I do not blame you for questioning it .
we understand your concerns .
courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen .
it is no accident that we have already returned several times since then .
as you said , listen and talk to each other .
that is very important .
we will remember that .
applause 
that is my criticism , and that is why I abstained .
i voted for the excellent report by my colleague , mr méndez de vigo .
it is thanks to direct universal suffrage that we can rightfully speak on behalf of all europeans .
the treaty of lisbon increases the number of meps from 736 to 7our parliament therefore had to adopt new provisions concerning its composition for the rest of the parliamentary term .
temporary ?
furthermore , after his initial democratic undertakings bakiyev's rule turned authoritarian .
meanwhile , bakiyev fled the country to seek refuge in kazakhstan .
a united nations led international investigation into the events is needed , in order to identify responsibilities .
there can be no consent , on our part , to other measures .
the whole of europe expects this of us .
putting electric cars on the market could represent a competitive advantage for european industry .
i am relying on the other european institutions to support us in this undertaking .
the success of this strategy will definitely reduce costs for users , thereby making electric vehicles more attractive .
industrial manufacturers will need to standardise their various industrial specifications , which will have a direct impact on costs .
we must find ways of encouraging european consumers towards using electric cars .
the eu must , therefore , invest significantly in creating a supply network that effectively covers europe's territory .
nine out of 10 eu citizens believe that the traffic situation in their area should be improved .
it follows detailed consultations with the motor vehicle sector .
this industry continues to be fundamental to the european economy , contributing to employment , technological innovation and competitiveness .
in fact , it welcomes the abolition of the exemption and the application of the general law of competition .
block exemptions contribute , therefore , to legal certainty and to the consistent application of european rules .
one european in three will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime .
cancer is one of the biggest health challenges we are facing worldwide .
the european commission proposes a european partnership for action against cancer for the period 2009 20the member states must act together , particularly in the area of screening .
in europe , one in three people will develop cancer during their lifetime .
we must not only invest in treatment across europe , but also provide support for preventive measures .
medical science is still unable to stop cancer , which is becoming one of the greatest plagues of humanity .
similar measures should be put in place throughout the union , but with greater intensity and effectiveness .
in poland , about 100 000 people fall victim to cancer every year , and 70 000 die .
this new form of cooperation is intended to support the efforts of member states in the fight against cancer .
medical statistics show that over 3 million new cases and 1.7 million deaths are recorded every year in europe .
this is the most cost effective measure , because one third of cancer cases can be avoided .
all these forecasts only serve to encourage us towards making full use of state of the art technologies .
in this way , consumers will be able to manage their energy consumption , evening out the demand curve .
all the original parts of the text that some groups wanted to delete remained in .
time and financial resources are needed to change this .
however , the experts are not very optimistic .
civil protection structures have to prioritise preparedness for floods and droughts .
it is important to keep the social and public health implications of this challenge in mind .
it may gravely impact on respiratory health and increase the incidence of vector borne diseases .
like everything excessive , it is ridiculous .
this is a question of solidarity that the whole of the eu would benefit from .
the good new is that the amendment to delete the focus on nuclear safety was defeated .
we must make substantial efforts to successfully help enterprises and users adapt to climate change .
nevertheless , we cannot be satisfied with reducing these irregularities to marginal amounts or to almost zero .
i have therefore abstained from voting .
however , it is essential to guarantee its full operational independence .
combating fraud in european projects should be a priority for us .
therefore , all the attention should be directed at the public use of that money .
the european investment bank eib was established in 1958 by the treaty of rome .
in writing . that was an easy one .
that does not , however , mean that responsibility for the country's conflicts lies essentially with europeans .
however , when christians are murdered because of their religion , the eu takes months to react .
the european union must act as an honest broker in this respect and respond more quickly .

adjournment of the session
resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday , 6 may 20statements by the president
to begin with , I would like to give you some information .
exactly 20 years ago , the world health organisation removed homosexuality from the international classification of diseases .
we talked with them , we sat together and discussed matters related to the union .
first prize was won by thetrain for europeproject from germany .
young people from all countries of the union entered the competition .
we wish them stability .
in the european union , we have a great need for stable governments .
the minutes of the previous sitting were approved 
thank you once again to both members for drawing my attention to this .
i agree with you entirely .
they are our representatives .

we will now proceed to the order of business .
monday no changes .
tuesday no changes .
wednesday 
concerning monday and tuesday , there have been no requests or submissions about amendments to the order of business .
mr president , this morning the council answered the outstanding questions via the spanish presidency .
an official letter is on its way to parliament .
this morning , documents were indeed received from the council , and I scrutinised them .
they include an annex that is identical to the annex to the document we received on 10 march .
the request will be moved by the rapporteur , mrs bauer .
therefore , I ask that we postpone this until the june plenary .
it is true that this commission legislative proposal was rejected in the committee on employment and social affairs .
the debate on the bauer report will be postponed until the next part session .
the request will be explained further by mr preda .
who would like to speak in favour of the request ?
the president cut off the speaker and asked for order in the house 
flawed european economic governance reacted , in my opinion , too late .
i refer , for example , to the need to revise the directive on market abuse .
by the same token , I repeat my proposal to create a european credit rating authority .
that is what I wanted to talk to you about .
there is talk of losses of eur 42 million a day .
lastly , it must encourage the member states to gradually replace their fleet of combustion vehicles with electric cars .
the competitiveness council will be informed of the result on that date .
such a situation falls foul of one of the community's most important principles the principle of solidarity .
the latest move robs britain of vital veto powers by allowing qualified majority voting on future bail outs .
telepathic signals , possibly ?
how long before the president of parliament excises our right to vote in the plenary session ?
the lawyers abderraouf ayadi , ayachi hammami , mohamed abbou and radhia nasraoui are the victims of constant intimidation .
the president cut off the speaker 
this will only be possible , however , if we have strong and , above all , independent policies .
mr kazak , you spoke too quickly for our interpreters .
that concludes the item .
what is more , the latter took nine months to come up with a common position .
you therefore have one minute left for the end .
it involves creating a space for private initiative and new jobs .
they therefore have the same right to social protection as the state accords to employees .
thank you , madam president .
breaks in their involvement in the labour market during maternity leave should not be a handicap to mothers .
nonetheless , I should like to make the same point as mrs lulling .
nonetheless , there is another important issue , and this is something I think we need to stress .
some have called increasing maternity leave to 14 weeks progress , and indeed it is .
how does the report fit in here ?
interesting times , and an interesting side effect to our report .
the number of self employed workers in the united kingdom has risen to 1.7 million .
however , I am still concerned about legislation in matters of employment being made in brussels .
more regulation and more insurance obligations were a matter of debate .
we need to establish a genuine alternative with regard to entrepreneurship for people , both men and women .
maternity leave is also provided for all women .
however , we meps must continue to eliminate the inequalities between men and women .
pt madam president , this directive needs to be reviewed urgently .
it is another step on what is still a very long road .
we must all combat job insecurity and the failure to recognise rights , especially in times of economic crisis .
self employed persons and their partners , the majority of whom are women , have rights .
de madam president , thank you very much for allowing me to speak on this subject .
around 30 % of all those in self employment in the eu are women .
in all these areas , it is necessary to ensure appropriate social and legal protection .
there is just one amendment .
self employed people often do not have sickness insurance .
they work when they are sick , because it is financially more advantageous .
self employed people are essential to the functioning of the economy and they have an irreplaceable role in society .
improving the energy performance of buildings will have a major impact on european citizenslives .
in november 2009 , a political agreement was reached on the technical aspects of the legislative proposal .
the directive will be reviewed by 1 january 20this is why I recommend its adoption .
i am sure that parliament's support today represents an important step .
i would like to thank you all for your good cooperation .
firstly , it is very important that the commission comes forward with a robust cost optimal methodology for renovation .
what we really need now from the commission is a european buildings initiative with four central pillars .
as many have mentioned , 40 % of our energy is consumed in buildings .
in contrast , renovations particularly of listed buildings could be very expensive .
however , thousands and thousands of houses are empty with no one living in them .
as such , there is no need to build new houses .
it is vital to improve the energy performance of buildings in order to achieve the eu 2020 strategy objectives .
they will be introduced in romania , according to government representatives , by 1 january 2011 at the latest .
the ministry of regional development and tourism has this year allocated ron 150 million for this purpose .
this directive will also help us to overcome the crisis .
moreover , in the long term , it will reduce the household expenses of european citizens .
in the area of buildings , there are a huge number of players .
its value will come with its transposition .
europe is at least a significant step ahead of other continents in this respect .
in the next few years , we are going to gradually drive back these emissions to zero .
the energy performance of buildings is an area with strong potential for the european union .
we need to treat this issue as a priority because europe is seeing the emergence of an energy crisis .
modernising residential buildings offers particularly important opportunities .
however , two features of the directive under discussion deserve a positive response .
this kind of structural support affords an opportunity for the achievement of our objectives .
the objective of this regulation is to enable new textile fibres to be placed on the market more quickly .
consumers can consult a website or other source for additional information if required .
the proposal therefore aims to promote innovation within the textile sector .
i will adopt the same approach for the amendment that proposes labelling non textile parts of animal origin .
this sector effectively represents one of the main lines of development for european clothing products .
i thank you for your attention , and will listen carefully to your comments during this debate .
it must not benefit industry alone .
however , we did not want to stop there .
this is also one of the reasons why we have given this proposal such clear support .
i should also like to add my thanks to the rapporteur .
allow me to reemphasise what the issue is here .
we would find that regrettable , because we genuinely believe that action needs to be taken relatively quickly here .
i want to take us back , in line with what mrs rühle was saying .
this would benefit not only consumers , but also serious companies .
commission , ladies and gentlemen , I am surprised that I am the first to mention this .
why have we not been much more ambitious as regards social labelling ?
why do we still not have it ?
it is important , for example , to test whether the fibres are allergenic .
we should then go further by establishing real community preference .
unfortunately , a large proportion of the goods are produced in countries with no form of product control whatsoever .
this proposal started off as mainly technical and non political and was just a means to bring three directives together .
consumers are entitled to accurate , relevant , understandable and comparable information on the composition of textile products .
this will allow social decisions on purchasing choices to be made .
the application of this regulation could see an increase in the competitiveness of smes .
we are not debating a technical report here .
we need to know where a product comes from , where it was made .
however , we really must take care not to mix up two different things here .
can we succeed in arriving at a rule for consumers ?
i believe that we must all agree on this positive aspect that has emerged from this report .
if this regulation does not come about , then we will all be disadvantaged somewhat .
it is very complex to get our labelling correct .
i watched a very disturbing report on cnn about the state of the pearl river in china .
the labelling is also very important .
we have been far too stringent regarding our own countries , and not so with third countries .
finally , the suggestion about having the same sizes right across the european union is a very good one .
commission's position on amendments by parliament
the commission cannot accept amendments 19 , 37 , 38 , 63 , 68 and 7i think that it erodes democracy if we reach an agreement even before the discussion in plenary .
new developments in public procurement short presentation 
allow me to reiterate and highlight the main points of my report .
unfortunately , this is at the expense of innovation and quality .
these judgments do not give contracting authorities a blank cheque , but rather provide them with a clear framework .
i notice that several speakers would like to express their opinions .
it was a pleasure to work with her on this report .
we cannot simply say that it is something we do not want .
ro I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for all her efforts on this report .
i am concerned by the large number of disputes over public procurement in numerous member states .
in my opinion , we should support the basic principle of that aim .
the internal market assumes that any european company can access acquisitions made in any member state .
work has already begun on some initiatives , which are in response to those comments .
the vote will take place tomorrow tuesday , 18 may 2010 .
at the moment , we that is , the eu per se are not particularly coherent .
the eu has long recognised in theory that political measures must not be contradictory .
policy coherence for development is laid down in the treaty of lisbon .
let us be judged by this requirement .
we need expertise in the council , the commission and in parliament that can recognise incoherent aspects .
the commission's work programme on policy coherence is a good step in this direction .
so far , the commission has not been able to eliminate this suspicion .
we need the committees to be more joined up and we need a permanent rapporteur .
i think there is , perhaps unfortunately , an attack on european farmers in this report .
i would urge colleagues to note those paragraphs carefully .
pt the european union's policies and actions in several areas frequently contradict stated development aid objectives .
this resolution comes at just the right time .
as you know , the commission has proposed a 12 point action plan to support the millennium development goals .
policy coherence is not just about recording any negative impact that eu policies may have on the development goals .
that is why the commission has adopted a new and improved approach to policy coherence for development .
the european union and the member states must fulfil their commitments in this area .
to that end , the commission has proposed to establish a responsibility mechanism within the union .
this proposal is currently being examined by the member states .
if we are to make our policies more coherent , we must involve our partners .
that option must be used far more systematically .
that is not in question and the union is fully aware of it .
penalties for serious infringements against the social rules in road transport short presentation 
it has to be said that the results were sobering .
the penalty for the same offence in different member states varied from eur 500 to eur 5 000 .
differences in the frequency of checks also result in great uncertainty among drivers and undertakings .
as we are all aware , this can only be achieved if we have an effective penal system .
the penalties must be clear , transparent and , above all , comparable .
an agency with general competence for road transport could be responsible for this .
there is one further significant factor to mention before I conclude my comments .
in many member states , there are not really sufficient safe parking areas .
this report must not be the end of this work .
the commission welcomes parliament's decision to follow up the report it drafted .

the sitting was closed at 21.40 
composition of parliament see minutes
utilisation of these democratic means must not be dependent on the possession of large financial resources .
this is the challenge for us , the european parliament , just as it is for other european institutions .
we have reduced energy consumption by 0.8 % .
there are even those who insinuate that mepsallowances are increasing , which is not true .
i completely disagree with him in this regard .
we are all aware of increased competences , but more competences do not necessarily require more spending .
it requires more efficient spending , more accountability and more responsibility .
i completely agree with mrs trüpel , who said that there are ways to make additional savings .
we do not need a fleet of cars here in strasbourg .
we have free public transportation .
the previous speaker is right .
most importantly , however , citizens themselves must be able to take such decisions .
the elite decides , and the public coughs up .
if you are not worth yours , then you have my sympathy .
we must examine whether we thus want to and are able to continue these activities .
this is totally unacceptable .
this house should demand that council end the strasbourg circus and save annual costs of over eur 200 million .
since january , I have been the head of a regional authority in my own country .
thank you for your speeches .
the debate is closed .
it will be available for the council on 3 and 4 june .
today , resettlement is carried out , but there is no structural coordination at eu level .
the proposal tabled in september 2009 aims to improve the situation .
it is crucial that we maintain this positive momentum and that the adoption of the proposal is not delayed .
we regret , however , that certain divergences and procedural issues are hampering the rapid adoption of this proposal .
madam president , I would like to thank mrs malmström for being here .
of course they have we need to make a commitment to these refugees .
it is very important to make clear which people this relates to .
we must therefore be sensible .
madam president , I would like to speak about the schengen information system .
we in france are well aware of the abuses that can result from file connection .
the increase in the numbers of members of this place requires a complete re ratification of the lisbon treaty .
europe is missing , that is who .
the first new addition is a dual approach .
we saw fit to maintain these priorities but give them autonomy .
i am , in fact , astonished at how this programme has not existed on a european level before .
that is not my evaluation it is the evaluation of the federal republic of germany .
we do not want an extension of the deadline to 2013 we want to make that very plain .
the main problem is a lack of solidarity within the union .
these measures , which I support in principle , mr tavares , require a detailed prior financial study .
the entire eu asylum concept is a disaster , as far as I am concerned .
the adoption of a common european union initiative is dictated by the increased strategic use of resettlement .
who is it that needs to show solidarity ?
sk I would like to talk about the schengen information system .
this is the joint debate on the schengen agreement .
pl above all , I would like to congratulate mr coelho on two more successful reports .
sis 1 + does not give this guarantee .
so in this area of security , we must not stop work on sis ii .
i recognise the need for this as well .
many thanks for the positive comments by various fellow members .
after all the delays , indefinitely extending the commission's mandate does not make any sense .
this approach must also resolve many of the bureaucratic issues with coordination that we have today .
we must consolidate it and make it sustainable .
maybe at some point , the commission could discuss the fact that the competent commissioners should be here .
i am sure that mrs malmström will be a wonderful representative .
member of the commission . madam president , thank you for your understanding .
the diversification must allow an indigenous development that would create stability and well being in these regions .
we all know what a key role agriculture plays in the local economy .
this is vital for security and biodiversity .
unfortunately , there was no consensus on this position at the last trialogue .
this is regrettable for two reasons .
the way the report has now been drawn up provides good conditions for achieving these goals .
however , I would have preferred the safeguards recommended in committee to have been kept .
this has resulted in price volatility and great financial losses for farmers .
these could do enormous damage to the outermost regions , and indeed every region .
i think that it is time that the european union got stronger and fairer with its own farmers .
that is why and I am also answering mr tirolien here we have not introduced other amendments .
moreover , I am sure that we will be able to do so .
allow me to briefly enumerate the improvements achieved .
written statements rule 149 
this is why specific measures are required to promote their future social and economic development .
milk is the azoresmain agricultural product .
establishment of a european asylum support office 
an eu strategy for youth investing and empowering 
el madam president , ladies and gentlemen , these are critical times for the whole of europe .
before the vote 
the president cut off the speaker 
specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the union 
estimates of revenue and expenditure for the year 2011 section I parliament 
before the vote 
there has been a misunderstanding .
we reject all the amendments , except our own .
it looks as though the leadership of your group is well aware of the situation .
new developments in public procurement 
the eu policy coherence for development and theofficial development assistance plus concept
it pulls the wool over people's eyes .
it is mainly old buildings that are a problem , of course , and not just blocks of flats .
yesterday , my colleague , marian jean marinescu , mentioned a special fund .
it committed budgetary funds for aid to banana producers in those regions .
although we should welcome such support , for many banana producers , this support will not be enough .
it does not make sense , and I hope the commissioner hears these views .
claims for such payments should be enforceable in a court of law by both farmers and clients .
elements that are not meaningful and appropriate must be dismantled and simplified .
this is the case , in particular , for the often very complicated and disputed cross compliance regulations .
one of the key things we hear about all the time is the bureaucracy involved in the industry .
legislation must be meaningful to farmers and we must not restrict farmers from food production .
i think it is over 17 different directives .
we therefore need clear , workable and comprehensible models .
anything involving an educational approach to a particular topic should involve simplification rather than complication .
energy saving and energy efficiency effectively represent a source of energy production .
green investments for our children , not radioactive waste !
i will now move on to the explanation of vote for the rühle report .
cs public procurement is unfortunately an area suffering from one of the highest levels of corruption .
i was happy to back the report by heide rühle calling for a simplification of public procurement .
we are reducing production in europe .
that has a consequence for the developing world .
i encourage you , therefore , to report your complaints to this desk provided by euro contrôle route .
i call for the mechanisms and resources necessary to establish the asylum support office to be ensured quickly .
it is vital for us to harmonise both our asylum laws and practices .
the present report treats this element , which I find very important , only as a subordinate issue .
this directive is a good compromise between encouragement and constraint where environmentally responsible construction is concerned .
i also call on them to find the appropriate financing model for renovating existing buildings .
we spend 50 % of our lives in our homes .
we must give priority to the way in which our homes are designed .
furthermore , energy savings for energy efficient buildings average 30 % over conventional buildings .
the longer the chain of conversions , the greater the losses .
in practice , this mainly concerns the stream of heat energy released from primary energy sources .
friction in anti friction processes , such as in bearings , and in friction processes such as brakes .
this concerns mainly cars and turbulence in aeroplanes .
the building sector was identified by the eu as one of the markets with the highest energy saving potential .
this will guarantee that in time , eu buildings become sustainable from an energy point of view .
i express my support for the recommendation to improve the energy efficiency of buildings .
energy efficiency means not only saving energy , but also reducing co2 and greenhouse gas emissions .
member states must adopt suitable measures in order to implement this directive quickly .
public buildings must set an example by complying with this legislation before 31 december 20the eu budget will fund part of the costs of the reforms .
the directive will be revised before 20the construction sector is one with tremendous energy saving potential .
the sector is responsible for 40 % of energy consumption and 35 % of total greenhouse gas emissions .
nearly zero energy buildings are buildings with very high energy performance .
it should be further developed and expanded into an effective protection instrument by the eu .
one of theeligible actionsof the european refugee fund erf is resettlement .
it is for that reason that I voted against this report .
i therefore voted against this report .
i think it is essential to increase financial assistance for countries which are engaged in helping refugees .
in reality , the exact opposite is the case .
the misery of these poorest people is an affront to affluent europe , and so we return them .
the christian organisations are a thorn in the eye of our conscience .
the report on the schengen information system and its modernisation contributes to this magnificent breakthrough in free intra european movement .
i logically voted for this report .
it is indeed regrettable that the start of this system has been delayed .
however , it is necessary to seek the approval of all of the institutions .
i voted broadly in favour of the proposed amendments to this regulation .
it also raises doubts about the lack of transparency in the way the process has been handled .
this report also indicates our disagreement with the council's vision .
for this reason , access to educational and professional guidance services is essential .
however , I completely reject refugees seeking asylum on political grounds within the eu .
european citizens should not be deceived by the title of this report by resettlement .
how can we trust the un and the first countries of asylum to organise such a check ?
according to the unhcr , there are 750 000 people in the world who could claim asylum .
do we have to receive all of them in our countries , on the orders of this organisation ?
allow me to express my support for the report by mr tavares .
the member states should adopt a more ambitious programme which will ensure the quality and effectiveness of resettlement .
since the lisbon strategy , education and training policies have been becoming increasingly important within the european union .
there must be less focus on stating shared positions that are as hollow as they are well intentioned .
modern higher education should prepare students thoroughly with a view to entering the labour market .
it is also essential to adopt effective measures to increase the representation of women in science and scientific research .
the members of the european parliament play a crucial role in promoting european youth policies in the member states .
i voted for the report onan eu strategy for youth investing and empowering.
the eu should better inform , develop and implement the instruments that it already has at its disposal .
unemployment , temporary work , internships .
what kind of prospects await the younger generation ?
there is no point hiding behind good intentions and promises .
we must invest we must provide certainties , offer opportunities .
this is precisely the reason why I voted for the draft report compiled by mr papanikolaou .
i therefore advocate an ever greater commitment to youth policies at eu level .
young people , in particular , are especially hard hit by the current crisis .
in the face of rising youth unemployment , it is important to improve educational opportunities .
i agree with the view expressed by mr papanikolaou .
the economic crisis is having profound effects on young people , and represents a threat to their future prosperity .
the ageing population will also have a strong impact on their future .
the financial tsunami of the last few years has made most young people unemployed or underemployed .
now we have the chance to turn the crisis into an opportunity .
we need to facilitate a smoother transition between education and the labour market .
however , the impact of this essential investment will be limited unless we provide our young people with opportunities .
in the current economic crisis , it is of the utmost importance that the self employed be supported and encouraged .
workers must have the same criteria for accessing public social protection schemes , notably as regards contributions and privileges .
the problem does , however , remain open for textile products coming from third countries , our trading partners .
i am not against transparency and traceability of products for the benefit of the consumer .
in writing . I have supported this document .
the relations between the eu and ukraine have always been very close and based upon a constructive dialogue .
this economic transition must be supported by efforts aimed at institutional reform .
i firmly believe that this cooperation must be consolidated , which also means finding new forms of cooperation .
i also agree that monitoring mechanisms should be ensured that increase clarity , transparency and accountability .
a loan of eur 500 million will help ukraine come out of the financial crisis .
whether it will be possible to achieve those objectives depends on the ukrainians themselves .
the eu must therefore be an area of solidarity .
i agree with the rapporteur's aim of improving the clarity , transparency and documentability of the proposed project .
helping ukraine by making eur 500 million available is therefore the right decision strategically , which we will support .
i hope it will be swiftly delivered in conformity with the conditions underlying the provision .
the macro financial assistance for ukraine is the first case to be decided under the new procedure .
i urge the eu institutions to build upon the experience of granting ukraine macro financial assistance and avoid further delays .
it will be submitted to the european parliament only this week .
this is a fair goal .
that is why I voted as I did .
the previous criteria for support of these areas must be modified so that they reflect actually existing handicaps .
this cost benefit analysis is important to ensure better results and resource management .
all amendments tabled to the report were rejected .
parliament can come back to this issue at the first reading of the 2011 budget in september / october .
however , it does not fail to have a rigorous approach to the effective use of available resources .
excessive bureaucracy must be cut back if we are to achieve an efficient , competitive agricultural sector in europe .
therefore , I call on the commission to include this matter in the bilateral discussions with the member states .
i therefore voted in favour of the report .
ukip therefore voted against the resolution as a whole , especially as it is without legislative impact .
simplification has to mean greater responsibility for all the actors involved .
to start with , I would highlight the proposal to create a uniform system of animal identification .
through this regulation , we will also contribute towards creating a new and fair market in agriculture .
the simplification of legislation is a goal that is essential to bringing europe closer to the public .
the harmonisation of legislation must be accompanied by the elimination of redundancy .
furthermore , I agree with a deferral on the obligation of electronic sheep tagging .
simplifying the principles which define the operation of the common agricultural policy is extremely important .
farmers do not need more eu direct support they need fairer prices for their products .
it has to be results orientated and offer a greater capacity to respond .
at the same time , farmers must be kept well informed and be given more assistance by the authorities .
the determination shown in the report to simplify the administrative rules of the common agricultural policy is also important .
the cost of monitoring financing will also be lower .
a significant portion of the funds from member statesbudgets is spent on public procurement .
public authorities must be encouraged to base public procurement on environmental , social and other criteria .
contractors , in particular small and medium sized enterprises , demand legal certainty and swift processes .
public procurement is a very delicate matter which deserves to be treated very seriously as it concerns public funds .
procurement also has a significant impact on small and medium sized enterprises , which often act as subcontractors .
we need coordinated action at european level to counter this effect .
i applaud the rapporteur for his work and am voting in favour of this .
the clash between europe's development policies and its trade policies is a reality .
trade policy cannot be immune to this goal .
this is an important step towards fairer trade .
the european union must set an example in this area .
in particular , the report proposes a harmonisation of penalties by means of a common categorisation of fines .
infringements are a serious problem in road transport , which poses significant questions as regards border crossings .
this will ensure better road safety in each of the member states .
at the same time , the greatest possible protection must be ensured for living donors .
we defended these in the introductory parts of the provision known as the recitals .
this will help to achieve self sufficiency in organ donation and therefore to combat transplant tourism .
this is why we are here today to ensure high quality and safe organ transplantation across europe .
this is what the commission's proposal for a directive and the action plan are about .
allow me to comment on a few specific issues .
i also understand parliament's concern about transparent , non discriminatory and scientific criteria for organ allocation .
the commission is willing to support the member states to address these issues .
let me also raise another issue adopting a law is the first step .
parliament has always supported this .
the line between life and death does not come any clearer than this .
i am pleased that the views advanced by the committee on legal affairs have been taken account of .
this report portrays that picture very clearly .
that is precisely the reason why this debate is quite so emotionally charged .
spain has organised this much better with its transplant coordinators .
voluntary donations that are free of charge are also the safest option , even for the recipients of organs .
the most shocking have been the reports that describe people actually being killed .
for example , australian organ transplant surgeons have condemned the practice in china of killing prisoners for their organs .
this standard is a logical and very welcome step .
i value that highly .
as far as the list of speakers is concerned , the cause is being looked into .
mr ouzký , many thanks once again for bringing this to our attention .
this would not only fly in the face of our aims .
statistics show that the situation differs greatly among the various member states .
the area of living donations has been the most challenging .
however , I also saw how he waited and how his quality of life was restricted .
let us make use of those conditions .
the president cut off the speaker 
for me , the key issue is raising awareness and I believe these reports will help achieve this .
many more can be .
i commend this report .
this is a weakness and I hope and believe that it is not serious .
for supplying information about a single donor , doctors in poland could earn more than one month's salary .
all measures must be implemented to combat mafia style networks and transplantation tourism .
we must guarantee the principle of free transplants and prevent any pressure from being put on potential donors .
the basque country euskadi has the world record for organ donation .
there seems to be a kind of controversy between the two .
what are the issues here ?
can coordination be improved ?
let us push for factual knowledge to be exploited in practice .
donation rates and the availability of organs vary considerably between european countries .
the good practice that can be achieved produces much greater benefits in some member states than in others .
there is only organ donation .
thank you for your input , your cooperation and your support .
rapporteur mr miroslav mikolášik ppe 
directly acceptable amendment 106 text as a whole , block no 1 , compromise amendment .
that was our task and that is what we have done .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 19 may 20 the sitting was suspended at 16.25 and resumed at 16.30 
the new law will save many lives and optimise the organs donated by allowing member states to share organs .
this regulation constitutes an important framework which needs to be developed upon by the respective member states .
the next item is the joint debate on 
what does this mean ?
i would also like to thank mrs gál and mr preda for their cooperation in the two other committees .
this increases our credibility , as mr jáuregui's report very rightly states .
i want to be reassured that if the eu signs the convention , that position will not change .
they can bring cases of this nature before the european court of human rights under article such cases can be brought before the european court of human rights in strasbourg under article it is thus easy to see the benefits .
thanks to the convention on human rights , these travellers have special protected rights .
the rapporteur wants us to involve our national courts and ministries of justice in this process .
the convention on human rights has degraded the rights of my constituents .
it is his first report and I am sure that it will not be his last .
the court's chief prosecutor , luis moreno ocampo , has skilfully helped the court to strengthen its impartiality globally .
denying free speech is what the eu does best !
should there be no restrictions on freedom of speech ?
quite simply , they are wrong .
prior to its creation , many of us wanted the court to have a preventative role .
personally , I continue to believe that it is part of the solution .
it will be very difficult to explain to our citizens which court is the right one for their complaint .
accession to the convention , however , does not increase protection for human rights .
so this symbolic gesture is extremely important .
i thank the rapporteur .
africa is a continent where many crimes have not yet been punished .
the role of the court in this matter is crucial .
the existence of an effective court can , of itself , have a preventative effect .
let us not forget that the court in luxembourg has been applying the convention for years .
i thank you in advance for finally making an exception to the general rule for once .
es madam president , I would like to clarify two things .
secondly , the jurisdiction of the european court of human rights is supranational .
here , we are giving them twice the rights , and that is what europe is about .
so I do not think we should discuss this any further because that is simply done .
now there will be supplementary guarantees concerning the eu law .
of course the issue of the risk of conflicting jurisprudence has to be analysed .
the commission expects case law of strasbourg and of luxembourg to develop harmoniously and converge in the coming years .
i now move to more specific questions .
the european parliament has so far , under the leadership of its rapporteurs , done very good work .
we have to make it count .
we will do that systematically in all our discussions with partners outside of europe .
i will give you an example .
to the court of justice of the european union .
what does accession add ?
this is a substantial development , given that member states have transferred important powers to the european union .
this is an area which will be particularly affected by the union's accession to the convention .
why ?
we must make sure its principles are upheld in all member states .
regardless of this fact , latvia was accepted into the european union in 200as a result , there are approximately 340 000 non citizens living in eu territory .
so we should be glad that the system will be strengthened .
the next item is the council and commission statements on the stockholm action plan .
this is undoubtedly one of the great achievements of the area of freedom , security and justice .
we are therefore talking about an extremely important programme , which must be implemented and set out in detail .
i hope that the measures will be presented in a user friendly way .
it is now close to the end of the spanish presidency , with five weeks to go .
we really are waiting for it .
the anti discrimination directive is something this plenary voted for and the greens are really waiting for that .
the lisbon treaty gives parliament a new role , and I would like the commission to act upon it .
parliament's homepage tells us that more than 20 % of young people in europe are unemployed .
along with what I have mentioned , there is a great deal more that has been said .
on the question of substance , mrs reding spoke of added value .
el the big word missing from immigration programmes is the wordsolidarity.
finally , of course , there is the huge obligation of solidarity towards immigrants themselves calledintegration.
we may be building time bombs .
that is an understatement if ever there was one !
the european arrest warrant is a gross miscarriage of justice in itself .
this is one of the spanish presidency's priorities .
regarding security issues , the internal security strategy was adopted in the march european council .
so , there are various important initiatives under way in relation to immigration .
it would also be very interesting at a later stage in order to be able to prosecute transnational crimes .
it is also a debate that has been launched by the spanish presidency of the european union .
that is where we are starting from an impossible situation .
fortunately , we now have the lisbon treaty .
first , a thorough analysis of what is feasible , what is good , what has added value .
there is an awful lot in the pipeline .
question time commission 
but let me just say one thing very clearly .
subject action by the commission on copyright
i would firstly like to thank mrs geringer de oedenberg for her question .
it goes right to the heart of the current debates on copyright and the internet .
furthermore , this is the role that I envisage , with you , for the european legislator .
neither am I dogmatic or deluded about the chances of finding one size fits all solutions .
i welcome the initiatives being taken by the commission .
i can confirm that , on this point , this is not the approach that we have chosen .
you wonder why we are not more ambitious as regards the creation of a single european copyright .
therefore , the new copyright would not apply to all pre existing musical compositions .
however , we do not intend to amend the catalogue of exceptions .
the current state aid map was agreed based on statistics from 200the european economy is now radically different .
it is unbelievable .
however , that is the case according to the figures we had this morning .
seventeen member states were given the possibility but only three have done so .
this will also be dealt with in a meeting with the ukrainian authorities in only a few weeks time .
they are an important neighbour .
subject spiralling crime rates in europe
the commission nevertheless acknowledges that organised crime is a threat to citizens and the economy throughout the european union .
the commission is determined to reinforce cooperation in this and is also preparing operational and legislative proposals on this .
i raised the possibility that these were being used for money laundering purposes , for criminal purposes .
i understand now from the united kingdom that there are real concerns about this .
member of the commission . I just want to thank the honourable member for this information .
thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
this question was put to you by me on 6 april 2010 and on 5 may 20i shall repeat the question in order to obtain a more specific reply .
subject a common eu visa policy
it will be discussed again by the member states in the council at the beginning of june .
there was a joint statement at that time moving forward .
the aim is to finalise this and to report on the outcome of the negotiations during the june council .
this is , of course , to the benefit of everybody .
i agree that there is a lot of room for cooperation here .
a number of recent developments have shed more light on member state involvement in the us rendition programme .
practices referred to as renditions and secret detentions are a violation of human rights .
in 2008 , the commission provided panoramic factual information in its public staff document on terrorism and fundamental rights .
we have some funding , we can provide support for victims and we can encourage further cooperation .
this is an area where the european union can help .
as they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together 
subject smes and job creation
what targets has the commission set and how will it propose to monitor these targets ?
next week is the european sme week .
mr president , I have now been speaking in my new capacity for two years .
to give an example the directive on late payment , and the exemption of micro entities from accounting burdens .
as well as that , there is too much bureaucracy orred tapein place .
how do you win an election ?
if we can get one job in every sme in europe , we will end the unemployment crisis .
many of them have committed themselves to doing this in the future .
the sitting is resumed .
my question is as follows .
does that actually fall within the commission's competence , and how does it relate to subsidiarity and proportionality ?
however , as I have already said , housing in general is not the same as social housing .
this amount concerns one member state the netherlands .
the threshold that has now been set is eur 33 000 .
i feel that insufficient room is left for flexibility , for tailor made solutions .
this 10 % is very small .
following today's debate , we must look at whether to come back again with a resolution .
in addition , during this legislature , we are going to work on services of general interest .
how can we calculate their incomes ?
the universality and the accessibility of public services are at stake .
we therefore have the crisis we have at the moment .
unfortunately , the rate of youth unemployment has reached 20 % in the european union at the moment .
it is understandable that the economic and social situations differ significantly in the member states .
i will digress slightly , if I may , beyond the specific scope of the question .
at other times , however , it arrives unobtrusively .
they also know the options for solving them .
in this set of questions which I received , these two issues competition and social policies overlap .
any subsidy given directly to citizens is not subject to state aid rules .
together with commissioner potočnik , I have therefore asked our offices to review applicable eu legislation .
commissioner georgieva was also there .
the oil slick now covers over 43 000 square kilometres , which is bigger than the netherlands .
decisions made under pressure from an industrial or political lobby should not be allowed .
however , measures are being taken in the united states .
at the same time , however , oil platforms are still being commissioned , mainly in the north sea .
there are , at present , hundreds of offshore platforms , drilling for both oil and natural gas .
secondly , what control measures are in place to ensure that safety requirements are fully met ?
what do you intend to do to move in this direction ?
it is all very well having vessels and civilian forces , but what do we have at our disposal ?
is it not time that we did so ?
madam president , commissioner , I too feel that we need to stop those in industry from playing god .
they are drilling everything they can , and at ever increasing depths , which clearly increases the risk of accidents .
i am thinking about alaska , for example .
let me urge that we are cautious and do not rush into new legislation .
there has to be a limit to what we can do in order to prevent them .
apparently , there were some irregularities in the granting of drilling permits by the united states interior secretary .
what does that mean ?
are you sure that your european maritime safety agency really is equipped to deal with something like this ?
would a risk fund perhaps be useful in this connection ?
ro I , too , welcome the commission's initiative .
there are currently a huge number of platforms in member statesterritorial waters extracting oil .
in the past , we took the global lead by imposing double hulls for oil tankers .
we should also concentrate all our mental energies and our financial resources on investing in renewable energy .
the sooner we do this , the better it will be for everyone .
was it human error ?
as a second point , we must move away from oil .
depths of 150 and 200 metres can be reached with manned submarines .
nord stream is not comparable with what is happening in the gulf of mexico .
we have put the relevant questions .
that is how we work in the commission .
the debate is closed .
these are still too general in nature .
the european union has been heavily affected by the consequences of the eyjafjallajökull volcano eruption in iceland .
it received broad support from the council of transport ministers at its extraordinary meeting of 4 may 20i am happy to report the first steps taken as a consequence .
in fact , the translation and publication took longer than the actual negotiations .
the commission has tabled urgent measures which have actually already been requested in the approved regulations .
the guide's absence can be used by member states as a pretext for delay .
passengersrights are a very important element .
europe has done a very great deal of work in this field , which is to be welcomed .
as you know , though , there are gaps in the legislation .
that is good news , but what is happening in the other member states ?
we observed that we need every mode of transport , including aviation .
do we have good crisis management arrangements for cases like this ?
it also deals with volcanic eruptions as a secondary responsibility .
now it has been producing computer projections based on second hand data , and it has been criticised for that .
how can we improve our technologies in the interests of aviation , the people and goods ?
quite how , then , is this to be solved ?
who , exactly , is to be compensated ?
do they then pass the money on to the passengers ?
will a dealer , a company , that had to wait for replacement parts receive compensation ?
i should perhaps like to start by thanking commissioner kallas for his endurance during those five days .
as a consequence , I believe we should draw some conclusions from this relatively critical situation .
perhaps we might then have avoided total paralysis of the airports and the shambles that followed .
otherwise , we will be isolated from the eu's transport system .
firstly , there were the passengers .
ten million people were left without flights and with no guidance as to what to do .
the impact on passengers was so great that the provisions of directives and regulations could not protect them .
the association of european airlines aea assesses the loss at eur 850 million at european level .
this blow was all that they needed to accentuate a spiralling crisis that is threatening many airlines with closure .
i will now discuss the commission's response .
this was said by a famous spanish sailor regarding a big naval battle that we lost .
the member states will be reluctant to provide resources .
the necessary penalty proceedings must naturally follow .
i live on an island which is behind an island which is off the coast of europe .
as such , our peripheral airports and our airlines are particularly important for connectivity and mobility .
let us not fool ourselves .
it is not going to go away any time soon .
this will lead to job losses in the airline sector and consequently , less competition in the market .
the financial burdens are very significant on all actors passengers , airlines and airports .
as a general rule I believe that the state should not artificially support business .
however , these are exceptional circumstances .
firstly , airlines must be involved in discussions about possible airspace closures from the outset .
i still have some reservations about the creation of a network manager .
how would this improve the current situation ?
an ordinary eu citizen who does not directly use aviation services has nothing to do with this business .
i think that the measures currently proposed by the commission are , unfortunately , not sufficient .
the eu transport ministers have established three separate flying zones based on the safety risk to aircraft .
this is a welcome development and , of course , further measures are still needed .
i strongly support the efforts to fast track the introduction of the single european sky concept .
it must be given statutory powers as opposed to the coordinating role which it currently holds .
the role of the european union must be strengthened in the aftermath of this crisis .
by doing so , it underlined once again the importance of a preventative approach to these phenomena .
an objectification of the entire issue must be at the heart of things , however .
it is clear that volcanoes continue to erupt as this icelandic volcano is doing .
nobody alone can be responsible for this risk no airlines , no governments , no european union .
this is a very clear message .
somebody mentioned that they should have insurance .
one of our biggest priorities for the near future will be to have better information about all these possibilities .
this is another interesting story .
this year's far smaller eruption of eyjafjallajökull has literally wrought havoc with air transport in the european union .
every day , 12 people die because of the shortage of organs available for transplantation .
promoting the idea of transplantation and coordinating the exchange of experience between member states can save thousands of lives .
agenda for next sitting see minutes
closure of the sitting
opening of the sitting
the joint debate on mechanisms for strengthening economic order ,
we are now no longer talking about private finances , but about public finances .
firstly , there was a crisis of financial stability in public accounts as a result of very marked deficits .
then came 23 april , when an action mechanism was adopted regarding greece .
however , obviously a short term strategy is not enough .
this is something that mrs harms and mr cohn bendit emphasise in their question .
i shall start with the immediate challenges and the crisis response .
i count on parliament's support for these important proposals .
they are at the heart of making europe 2020 a success in the coming years .
our proposals are based on two principles .
our proposals are made of three building blocks .
some have criticised this , saying that this is a breach of parliamentary sovereignty .
why is this important ?
we should prevent and tackle emerging problems before they escalate into a crisis .
that is the way to play as a european team for the benefit of the whole of europe .
this applies to both right wing and left wing governments .
we must learn lessons from all this .
second lesson the 27 must concentrate on their budgetary policies very early on in proceedings .
i myself asked for it in this chamber a few weeks ago .
the euro will only be viable if we collectively give ourselves the resources to make it so .
financially reward the ones that clean up their public finances and punish the ones that refuse to do so !
the commission , mr rehn , must not be afraid of doing this .
so that is the first assurance we should give them that their savings are protected .
what is the trade in credit default swaps and credit default insurance all about ?
i am sure that the lovely farm owned by mr daul is covered by a fire insurance policy .
it should be abolished and these practices should be banned .
these are exactly the mechanisms that we are discussing and the real life examples are not funny .
the pension fund did not succeed , but it bought something else instead .
they must be controlled and regulated .
protests 
we have allegedly created an economic and monetary union .
we are in the middle of an extremely serious crisis of legitimacy .
therefore , we need economic governance and we also ultimately need the strength to implement our own regulations .
applause 
in my opinion , this is much too late .
firstly , strengthening the stability and growth pact .
secondly , I believe that this package must also integrate a convincing 2020 strategy .
once again , it is an intergovernmental mechanism which was concocted within ecofin and which requires unanimity .
every single loan which is granted has to be approved by all the member states .
this is what we are expecting from the commission , mr rehn .
this is nothing new for my group .
as we see it , we have been trying to cure the symptoms since 200we have been attempting to save the banks since 2008 , when lehman brothers went bankrupt .
the euro was not stabilised during the weekend before last .
i would like to summarise the situation very briefly .
we must now make clear decisions on certain issues .
i am very familiar with this term in a german context .
we must safeguard jobs by means of innovation , future viability and sustainability , but this does cost money .
the introduction of new taxes is a taboo subject .
sanctions were previously available they simply lacked credibility .
would the new measures be taken any more seriously ?
mr president , the most recent council meetings indicate that far reaching changes are under way .
the treaty of lisbon praised the role of parliament and the strengthening of that role .
i believe that it is more likely to save the bankscapital .
mr barroso is right when he says that without an economic union , we can forget the monetary union .
we are lacking the lasting and effective re regulation of the financial sector .
although we have been talking about this tax for a long time , it remains just talk .
however , we cannot try and stimulate growth at the same time .
could you explain why this is ?
we can achieve this only if we have a stable currency and a stable economy .
firstly , we definitely do not want mr daul's farm to burn down .
we want to take precautions , that is our objective .
mr lópez garrido said today that it had taken an infuriatingly long time for the decisions to be reached .
we need to see intelligent measures taken by governments .
fr mr president , ladies and gentlemen , yes , we need responsible public spending .
yes , we need to balance our budgets .
the structural problem of ours has been that public overspending went on for too long .
you know you were the head of mr liikanen's cabinet .
he said the stability pact was stupid .
mr president in office from spain do we need taxation ?
they know that they will have to pay , but german taxpayers cannot always pay .
this was said by a former government leader who messed up his own country .
so what is he trying to prove ?
the president cut off the speaker 
i disagree with an economic and financial strategy that fails to contemplate specific needs .
this applies to the member states , but also to the commission and to us .
the president cut off the speaker 
however , the decisive point is that the council must take action on the legislation .
expenditure can be cut or taxes can be increased .
all states can cut expenditure at the same time , although separately , without needing any european coordination .
mr verhofstadt was saying that you had a right to take the initiative .
mr president , the lesson to be learned from this crisis is be honest and keep your word .
the hedge funds may be taking advantage of the situation , but they did not cause the crisis .
the president cut off the speaker 
it has not come up with any ideas or any incentives .
that is simply not enough .
the diversionary tactics aimed at areas of the financial market represent the wrong approach .
i think this is irresponsible .
it is a crisis that has demonstrated three intolerable asymmetries that must be overcome .
do not put your name to this mockery .
it has just been explained to us that parliament is going too far .
your presidency is responsible for this package .
you have our support .
do not listen to those in the council who capitalise on the lack of regulation .
this is exactly what our governments have also been doing .
eu 2020 should lay the bill at the right door .
this way , we preserve the european social model .
indeed , of what use is europe if not to support member states in need ?
the monetary and budget policies have proven inadequate in assuring productivity and competitiveness .
it is scandalous that the governments and the commission only react when the real weaknesses appear in the markets .
we need more europe and not less europe .
people have been killed , and there have been heavy material losses .
political strengthening is not being followed by the appropriate financial strengthening .
of course , we have to respect the stability and growth pact , which must be reformed .
we must face the facts .
this crisis does not remain static .
this crisis was economic and financial , and will have a growing social dimension involving social conflict .
secondly , we need to dare to tell the truth about what is happening to us .
i think that what is needed now is mention of the role of the member states .
the european commission and the european parliament should regain their strategic role and go for brave european solutions .
both citizens and markets need more europe .
the markets were well massaged and influenced towards getting us into the crisis in the first place .
i would like to hear from the presidency of the council and from the commissioner .
what is being done to police this ?
these may include increased euroscepticism and uncertainty among those countries that are preparing to enter the euro area .
we need to help and encourage those countries that have not yet introduced the single currency .
states have taken different measures in similar situations .
we cannot consume more than we produce , nor can we spend more than we can collect .
giving you more power will only work if you actually use the power you already have .
on the other hand , it provides an opportunity as well .
solidarity and adaptability must be the principles on which it is founded .
at the same time , it will help coordinate the drafting of the national reform plan .
the first victim was greece , followed by spain and portugal .
it would appear that the protagonists of the international economic crisis are now the states , not the banks .
sv mr president , europe needs more cooperation and more solidarity not protectionism and nationalism .
take a look at asia , commissioner .
the embrace of globalisation by the eu and its individual member states is a recipe for disaster .
we cannot compete with their goods without reducing our wage rates to their levels .
conscientious implementation of the principles of the stability and growth pact should be a priority .
the president interrupted the speaker 
i think there is one thing we could stop doing , and that is ridiculing greece .
now is the right time to incorporate the short term stabilisation measures into a long term strategy .
we need a vision of a market economy .
competitiveness is not the start but the result of economic activity .
therefore , we need clear rules in the europe 2020 strategy to deal with speculators and hedge funds .
we also need to be braver in applying the rules to the member states .
any state which deliberately falsifies its figures must quite simply be ejected from the euro area .
overall , we must focus on the small and medium sized enterprises smes .
the commission has simply forgotten to include objectives to strengthen small and medium sized companies in this programme .
in my view , that is the right way forward and it is important that we take that route .
we all perform better when there is somebody looking over our shoulder .
economic governance should now be proposed as a matter of urgency .
the stability and growth pact was not adhered to , and financial discipline was not maintained .
i would like to ask where was the european central bank ?
where was the commission ?
that is the way to respond to this situation right now .
secondly , just today , parliament has been examining a financial supervision package .
do not expect anything else expect us to do precisely that .
i strongly agree with those of you who have called for an economic union to complement the monetary one .
this is the way forward , and this is the critical lesson we must learn from the crisis .
colleagues , this is the round up of a very important debate .
it is now absolutely essential to move on with these initiatives .
if there is any lesson worth learning from the current economic crisis , it must be solidarity .
there are not enough concrete objectives and more of them are needed .
the longer people remain unemployed , the greater the risk , not just of poverty , but of exclusion .
predictions suggest that there will be a shortage of workers .
it is not necessarily such a straightforward procedure to integrate long term unemployed young people back into society .
i hope these appeals will be heard and put into practice .
we need predictive and longterm solutions and tools to help us manage future crises better than we do now .
the dawdling probably caused the situation to escalate .
our objective is a modernised labour market with a highly specialised , precisely oriented and very efficient workforce .
at present , 15 % of young people do not complete a full secondary education .
in march , the european commission presented a new economic development plan for europe .
after the lisbon strategy , europe 2020 is the next attempt at reviving the european economy .
not doing this may lead to another lost decade , a lasting halt to growth and mass unemployment .
thank you .
i am calling for this to be stopped .
however , taking note is the first step . after taking note , one acts accordingly .
welcome
european refugee fund for the period 2008 2013 amendment of decision no 573 / 2007 / ec 
we have been given , for example , documents from the year before .
i would like to ask you to reconsider this .
amendment 2 proposes that this part session period be postponed to the following week .
before the vote on amendment 3 
article 229 refers to a specific day , which is the second tuesday in march .
it goes without saying that any other interpretation merits respect .
however , as the presidency has to decide , it has so decided .
i request that you take appropriate action .
a steak must be a steak and a ham must be a ham .
i am sure that this is what the constituents of all the members of this house want .
the enzyme preparation functions as a stabiliser in the final meat product .
this technological function is explicitly described in the food additives regulation , which was adopted by parliament .
firstly , the product can only be sold pre packed to the final consumer .
this additive is , in my opinion , an example of a food sector development which will benefit consumers .
action plan on organ donation and transplantation 2009 2015 
before the vote on amendment 3 
we shall now proceed to the vote .
i know that we rejected the amendment , but this is a question of principle .
the amendment tabled by mr fox attempted to combine the august and the september plenary sessions in one week .
i would really like to clarify that this is unlawful .
i would like you to write a letter to the commissioner to justify those statements .
we are dealing with explanations of vote concerning the amending budget .
pl in contradistinction to the previous speaker , I endorsed the amending budget .
it is not an amendment which only concerns accounting .
we have just one or two people to support us .
i would like to thank the rapporteur , mr maňka , for his superb report .
if you die in another european union country , why should your organ not be used to save life ?
let our surgeons do their work .
let our patients be treated .
de mr president , I can only agree with the previous speaker .
if you hadn't done so , it would probably be the case that we would be still here .
i understand why we are here , and once we are here , we are very happy .
to avoid thrombin , it would be necessary to stop eating meat completely .
the commission's experts state that thrombin is not hazardous to health , and this opinion is scientifically based .
do not resort to a ban tighten up the rules on labelling instead .
it is pure populism .
we will be voting on the first reading of this regulation in june .
today , we had to vote on glued meat .
glued meat is meat which is glued together and sold as a high quality product .
among other things , it has unlawfully disbanded or had disbanded nearly every single street demonstration .
on the other hand , controlling the process would be rather difficult .
that is not the case .
we must take notice of what our citizens are saying to us .
this is the basis for effective and fair consumer protection .
all eu member states have ratified the rome statute .
it must seem that I am repeating what I expressed yesterday in relation to mr tavaresreport .
therefore , I am in favour of creating a fund at a european level .
it is inconceivable that the government does not agree to this recommendation on this basis .
in that framework , the agreement reached on the energy labelling directive brings important added value .
in this way , all members of the european public will become involved in combating climate change .
it acknowledges that the market is incapable of ensuring rational energy use .
of course , the public procurement process should set a good example in this respect .
people actually want to save energy , and mostly do this for two reasons , economic and environmental .
it will establish the fulcrum of an integrated and sustainable policy from an environmental standpoint .
the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon will probably cause a significant rise in parliament's workload .
the treaty of lisbon has given parliament new responsibilities .
this situation leads to increased costs .
the budget amendments are important and essential for the proper management of the life and activity of parliament .
i voted against the report on the supplementary budget for 20for one thing , you cannot employ highly trained experts for eur 1 500 per month .
secondly , there is no room for new staff in parliament's working premises .
for the reasons I have stated , I commend the rapporteur and express my agreement .
the european parliament's supervision of the council's finances is far from being transparent .
i support this report on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation .
i voted for the draft directive on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation .
i voted in favour of the proposal for a directive for the following reasons it is unacceptable that , on average , 12 people awaiting a transplant die every day .
organ donation must always be free and protected from any potential commercialisation .
the number of transplants in the european union has increased , saving and prolonging many lives .
however , there are still long waiting lists for transplants .
that is why I voted as I did .
i voted for a resolution calling for thrombin not to be used in meat .
the commission's proposals do not fully deal with these reservations .
i very much regret the adoption of this resolution relating to the banning of porcine and bovine thrombin .
let us not lapse into an emotional debate !
the wordthrombinand the phrasereconstituted meathave seemingly been clearly shown .
food safety and the health of european citizens are at stake .
we cannot allow the consumer to be misled by the food additive thrombin .
its role is to combine individual pieces of meat together into a single meat product .
i will vote in favour of the approval of this substance only if we impose a clear labelling requirement .
thrombin is currently in use .
there is a difference .
consumers are generally unaware of what is happening and are being deceived .
as mentioned in the report , that increases the risk of meat infection .
however , in our capacity as legislators , we need to ban certain harmful products .
yet thrombin is used in some member states without consumers being informed .
the attempts to deceive consumers and to try to hide the truth must stop .
that is not the way for manufacturers to restore consumer confidence .
funding the medical system does not come cheap .
every day , 12 of them die .
the number of transplants in the european union has increased , saving and prolonging many lives .
several thousand people die each year in europe because they have been unable to receive a transplantation in time .
i therefore voted in favour .
it is therefore necessary to assess this area rigorously from the perspective of the subsidiarity principle .
many eu citizens are not fundamentally against donation , but are afraid of adding their names to the register .
therefore , donation should be as accessible as possible promotion may often be effective .
eu accession to the convention will further strengthen the eu's system for the protection of fundamental rights .
i welcome this development .
this needs to change .
for all these reasons , I voted against the resolution .
therefore , I voted in favour .
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting see minutes
returning to my report it is an implementation report .
yet what is lagging behind is the utilisation of this research .
we must also realise the importance of the territorial dimension laid down in the treaty of lisbon .
we proposed maintaining the support measures until the normal production capacity utilisation rate was restored .
the first is to maintain support measures until the recovery has been consolidated .
that is the position that they have defended in the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
since that vote , the economic health of europe has deteriorated further .
the ecofin council had to start all over again on monday .
they argue for flexible implementation of the stability pact , so that an unwelcome austerity cure can be avoided .
i think that the authorities in this house will have to shoulder their responsibilities and learn lessons from this .
there is currently great concern within the committee on employment and social affairs about two issues .
i believe that fundamental change must be about much more than simply reducing the number of targets .
this is not all doom and gloom .
i am thinking about thefinancial supervisionpackage and the hedge funds document .
we must also utilise every single resource to free up the growth potential of our economy .
this work clearly comprises many aspects .
finally , there is also the promotion of social inclusion by combating poverty .
europe 2020 must begin here and now and should not be just a catalogue of objectives .
to think in those terms and with each of us making a contribution to the whole .
none of these things are ready and there is a great deal that has not even been addressed .
europe 2020 is a community union , not a nationalist or obstructive europe .
the decisions that we are refusing to take today will lead to new crises .
but now , sadly , we have a quadruple crisis if we add the state budget crisis .
it has made it painfully clear that the european union is in dire need of vision .
europe needs a forward looking union .
youth unemployment in spain , at 44 % , is devastating .
we have endless opportunities to create green jobs , but our policies must be aimed in the same direction .
to do this , we absolutely must have european coordination .
this is the conclusion reached in mr monti's report , which was submitted two days ago .
however , there is no mention whatsoever of this issue in the eu 2020 strategy presented by the commission .
but , on the other hand , it is rather an unfocused debate .
we need to spend more time on it together to work through the details .
they will get the benefits .
however , the initiative will be useful only if two conditions are met .
on this point , the socialists are failing .
they are not waiting on the group of the european people's party christian democrats .
there are studies which have shown that 8 million new jobs can be created through the energy transition alone .
in the europe 2020 strategy , we therefore need an initiative for green jobs .
i address those words to commissioner andor .
fundamentally , the structure of the employment policy guidelines presented is right and balanced .
the 2020 strategy , therefore , misses the point .
both the europe 2020 strategy and cohesion policy aim to achieve the same goal .
i would therefore like us to move further in this direction in the 2020 strategy .
commissioner , my question is therefore very simple .
instead they are moving backwards .
it is therefore simply a matter of getting started .
that is what the real debate is about .
do we not only want everyone to have jobs , but to also have good and proper jobs ?
cs we have spent the entire day discussing a desirable strategic focus for the european union .
let us build on a foundation of nation states .
that will be the source of our strength .
that is how we will make progress .
i really love europe , even if I do not love the european union .
that is precisely the state of affairs right now !
apart from the current rescue package , greece has benefited disproportionately in the past from agricultural and regional funding .
what is needed then ?
faced with the financial crisis , europe has not been inactive .
last monday , the same committee adopted the report on regulation of hedge fund managers by a large majority .
trialogues have been initiated to seek an agreement with the council .
this agreement must be obtained rapidly , so that our institutions retain their credibility .
however , europe is at a turning point if it does not find a new modus operandi .
we are at a turning point , fellow members .
what this crisis has shown is that a clear distinction must be made between savings banks and investment banks .
however , we must also look at the economy of the future .
the economy of the future will make efficient use of its natural resources .
here , too , the commission has too little ambition .
mr president , the central component of eu 2020 should not be stabilisation funds and bailouts .
we should be looking at existing successful projects and using eu links to find best practice .
south wales has five significant pharmaceutical development companies with world class technology .
yet liberal europe's project and activities have also run out of steam , and spectacularly so .
for the sake of the peoples , eu policy must be urgently refocused .
extraordinary situations require clear joint action .
small and medium sized enterprises are the backbone of europe's economy .
we need to start talking about growth and development again .
sv mr president , recent times have shown us the importance of healthy government finances .
when the european union started , poverty only existed where there was no work .
we therefore need a minimum framework of disincentives for redundancy .
mrs schroeder might consider this a bitter pill , but obviously you need to set a target .
however , we need to ensure better coordination of course , especially in the areas of research and innovation .
that means that if these countries are doing well , the 27th member state will do well too .
it also makes detailed proposals against the background of the new opportunities provided by the lisbon treaty .
last week's communication already constitutes a significant contribution to the task force .
this leads me to the two questions on the europe 2020 strategy .
together , they reflect the multifaceted nature of poverty and the range of situations in the member states .
the commission is actively exploring the possible solutions .
many governments have neither reduced student support nor scaled back enrolment .
however , we do see signs of planned decreases in the education budgets of other countries .
many such cuts would affect education .
other member states are exploring ways to diversify the sources of funding .
the commission will continue to watch this issue carefully .
in addition , the rise in pension demands and medical assistance must be kept in mind .
we cannot employ a one size fits all policy .
each case merits individual attention .
that will not achieve anything .
in fact , we have been consumed by it .
we need to clarify certain points .
we respect our partnersevery last euro and we thank them for their support .
that is the point of my speech .
keep it simple .
the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under rule 149 8 
although , I must say that the current greek government is not in any way responsible for the situation .
do you have a reply to this question , mr koumoutsakos ?
that is how we arrived at today's drastic situation .
let us not be dogmatic .
the others , quite frankly , are matters for individual member states .
this is not a greek crisis .
its role is also recognised through its inclusion among the objectives of the treaty of lisbon .
this name may be very meaningful when discussed by marketing specialists .
however , we are not talking about marketing specialists here , but about ordinary europeans .
these are the points I wish to offer for your consideration .
why not ?
the eu 2020 strategy can be different .
what does this mean in concrete terms ?
indeed , that must be the key objective of the eu 2020 strategy because europe needs social progress .
we need a more active labour market policy and one which covers many areas .
hence , the targets that we set ourselves are too ambitious and , at times , too inflexible .
we need to decrease the gender pay gap by 10 % in each member state .
member states cannot neglect to expand , improve and implement the barcelona targets in all member states .
i am convinced that our commissioner , mr andor , is going to do it .
ten years ago , we adopted a strategy , the lisbon strategy .
they are wondering whether we will be able to ensure the stability of our currency .
will there be inflation ?
are we really taking to task the players in the financial markets who have contributed to the crisis ?
instead , it should finally take parliament seriously as an equal legislator alongside the 27 members states .
el I agree with the previous speaker the stability pact needs to be applied .
the citizens must be healthy and educated and must have work .
the question is who is to blame for the fact that the dog ate the sausage ?
el you are absolutely right mrs rapti .
i am greatly concerned about our future together in the eu .
indeed , the cohesion policy is actually the best instrument for mobilising investment in growth and employment .
three of these seem to me , commissioner , to be priorities .
we have also learned that the contribution of regional funds is essential to meeting the objectives we are proposing .
if we work together , we will be much stronger .
however , that also means of course that our currency will come under pressure .
however , there are a number of areas which I would be concerned about .
softly , softlywill not do anymore .
we have to up our game .
they had not caused this metamorphosis .
applause 
as we discuss europe 2020 , we need to bear a situation of this type in mind .
i grew up in a country where society was organised according to multiannual plans .
this country , the german democratic republic , no longer exists .
the disquiet with such procedures is very much in evidence .
however , the european union today is much more than that .
this would certainly redress the population balance .
first and foremost , it is an essential pillar of the response of the union to the current crisis .
these are all very important elements .
following the debate , I should like to express my thanks for your support for my report .
the whole thing is far too flat .
therefore , I invite the commission to enter into a territorial pact with the regions , towns and cities .
my report concerns synergy between research , development , innovation , production and employment in europe .
the causes of the crisis can only be eliminated through structural reforms .
we need to adopt a coordinated approach for using funds earmarked for innovation and regional development .
these various programmes provide finance to the tune of eur 86 billion for the period 2007 20the eu 2020 strategy also emphasises the interdependence of the various eu policies .
university business dialogue debate 
furthermore , more entrepreneurial universities should be encouraged .
i would especially like to thank mr schmitt , the outgoing member , who was rapporteur .
the only question is what form it should take so that it is appropriate for both sides .
we very much appreciate the positive response to our communication which is reflected in your report today .
mr scurria referred earlier to mobility .
education and work are interwoven concepts .
what sort of skills ?
the basis of an independent university system is adequate public funding .
that is why special attention needs to be paid to the administration systems of universities .
firstly , I would like to mention the modernisation of the curriculum .
we can perhaps all agree that the solution is to develop links between businesses and universities .
this has been pointed out repeatedly in various documents , including the leipzig charter on sustainable european cities .
the key issue , however , is how to achieve these links .
in many eu countries , there is a growing lack of understanding among those in the university world .
we in the gue / ngl group think that we should listen to them .
we are asking for a comprehensive report on the bologna process to be drafted .
universities have shared information with each other for centuries , before the eu existed .
so what of modernisation ?
universities elsewhere may be overtaking us , but they owe their beginnings to european universities .
this report reflects outdated and failed thinking .
it is clumsy phrases chained together across many pages to hide the fact that it lacks substance .
in the austrian education system , you would be given a straight fail for this report .
that also applies to mr repo and mrs vergiat .
we need this cooperation at local , national and international level .
in recent times , I have seen three great examples of that .
this is why I believe that relations between the academic and business worlds need to be strengthened .
it is mainly the universities which will benefit from this money and carry out the research .
how can we get involved with small and medium sized enterprises , and also get students involved with smes ?
all these things are very important .
i , too , wish to congratulate the rapporteur .
after all , business does not set itself such an objective .
let me make another brief comment we need scientific creativity and scientific curiosity .
the priorities of the lisbon strategy are , put briefly , a knowledge based economy , innovation and scientific research .
madam president , honourable members , thank you for a lively debate and for your many proposals and ideas .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 149 
education and training courses must be restructured to recognise the needs of the workforce and of the knowledge based economy .
we want a european union based on the central role of the individual .
finally , I would like to summarise the situation as follows .
i think europe has a key role to play in this field .
as a romanian mep , I have even more interest in this particular issue of the kozloduy nuclear plant .
nevertheless , I think we should be intransigent regarding transparency in the use of european funds .
on behalf of the alde group . mr president , what can I say ?
are we all nuts ?
or can anyone else see any reason in it ?
mr tremopoulos , your time is up .
their closure several years ahead of time was not necessary it was certainly not on safety grounds .
it is also important to address the issue of compensating for and replacing lost energy capacity .
we can now see some amendments tabled by the greens , which have one aim only .
in this case , the greens are adopting positions which are diametrically opposed to their views .
i must say to you , however , that your speech seemed entirely improper to me .
when shutting down part of the power plant , its staff will face new challenges .
this goes against the principle of solidarity , which should govern energy policy .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday 20 may , at 12.00 .
the commission had been saying for some time that the units in question were eligible for financial improvements .
the eu is dependent on energy imports for 53 % of its requirements .
the sitting was closed at 21.20 
opening of the sitting
the sitting was opened at 10.05 
union for the mediterranean debate 
in light of this , we have pointed out the approaches that we think are necessary today .
we need to improve south south regional integration .
europe needs the south .
this is what we have achieved in our bilateral relations .
one comment the union strategy and policy in terms of energy for northern europe are very well documented .
the report on the union for the mediterranean is important because it focuses on immediate and quantifiable targets .
firstly , the political context .
it must make a positive contribution to resolving the conflict , insofar as it is able .
that will help us raise the level of mutual understanding and interconnection .
our current migration policy is no longer acceptable .
according to its constitution , syria is officially a popular democratic and socialist oriented unitary state .
apart from costing the european taxpayer several billions , these projects have come to nothing .
stop wasting taxpayersmoney and stop dreaming !
all due respect to mr albertini , however , for taking a brave position .
he has the support of my group .
this is an essential feature of every democratically elected assembly .
the mediterranean is therefore destined to change rapidly .
all that is left are the dreams of thousands of people , many of whom died as refugees .
the president cut off the speaker 
this report is truly bonkers !
the political aspect is blocked .
that is the acid test .
i will do that .
it is 10.57 , and at 12.00 we have the votes .
i agree with those who say that we lost a lot of time , particularly in building a secretariat .
thirdly , I too am sorry that the council is not here .
it is this same spirit that we wanted to develop with the mediterranean in this report .
written statements rule 149 
it also includes areas such as disaster control , energy and the environment .
the mediterranean regions are hard hit by water shortages and drought .
the need for an eu strategy for the south caucasus debate 
they are also a serious impediment to democratisation , political stability and social and economic development .
let me underline two very important milestones along this road .
last week , the commission published its third annual progress report for the south caucasus countries .
the stability and security of the south caucasus have a direct impact on europe .
the new association agreements will expand the trade provisions under the partnership and cooperation agreements .
trade barriers must be lifted and commercial and economic ties between the eu and the south caucasus strengthened .
this demonstrates the attitude of many politicians and people in positions of responsibility in this region .
however , to achieve this , democratic will is required from both us and the governments in the region .
all of this is necessary in order for us to make genuine progress in bringing peace to this region .
the regional dimension and cross border cooperation are important .
armenia has now made courageous efforts to resolve this long standing impasse over nagorno karabakh .
what are our goals in the south caucasus ?
we have great hopes for this region as we build a free and democratic europe .
against this background , I would like to say that the south caucasus is faced with two alternatives .
people should not be attempting to maintain the process of displacement .
frankly speaking , it is a step which certainly is overdue .
it is very good that the union has declared its support in this matter .
trade is one of the key instruments available to the eu for achieving these objectives .
it is very good that we do talk about them .
thank you .
the european union must definitely make a more active commitment in the future settlement of the nagorno karabakh conflict .
i am , therefore , going to allow only six members to speak .
pl the report on the south caucasus is a good report .
i would like to stress that one of the main problems is the unresolved matter of refugees .
for that we need a strategy .
mr president , I congratulate mr kirilov and mr kazak on their work .
i wish to emphasise two points .
the second point naturally concerns the energy issue .
this will give the caucasus a key role .
we should apply the same principles .
we should know that the universal application of principles is the best basis to start and build relationships .
this is the only sustainable way of reconciliation with the past and investment in a better future .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 149 
first of all , this means strengthening the presence of the eu in the region .
such a situation is both intolerable and humiliating .
we can continue cooperation with the russian authorities only on condition that they fully honour their own commitments .
first of all , I would like to tell you about the difficult situation in poland .
amendment of the agenda
in a crisis situation , democratic forces must join together .
many countries are currently experiencing problems .
for example , the people of slovakia have been hard hit by flooding .
i have nothing to add about procedural matters .
therefore , we should now try to obtain a majority for one position or the other .
therefore , mr president , I am of the opinion that we should vote today .
we have disastrous floods .
university business dialogue a new partnership for the modernisation of europe's universities 
does anyone wish to object ?
i was voting against it .
the need for an eu strategy for the south caucasus 
for the results and other details on the vote see minutes 
however , if we fail to do this , the whole of europe will go bankrupt !
it can meet certain gaps in the labour force but must be controlled and take into account local factors .
how detached from the real world can the european parliament actually get ?
there is no doubt that a stable mediterranean is a huge prize for the wider europe .
following the visit , I wrote an article calling for a mediterranean community .
written explanations of vote
for this reason , the reality of the internal market is not static but dynamic .
however , the economic crisis has undoubtedly affected public and consumer confidence in the single market .
these imperatives are likely to provide the single market with a competitive advantage against other major world economies .
in writing . this report could not have come at a more critical moment .
i support this report on a more active partnership between universities and businesses .
this own initiative report contains truly positive ideas for the future of our universities .
i therefore voted in favour of the report .
today , knowledge is a greater priority than ever .
it is a neoliberal approach , to which we are opposed .
university business dialogue is essential for the high quality training to which the eu's young people aspire .
preservation of this system , which is full of inequalities , is a mistake we cannot accept .
i voted for the schmitt report to encourage cooperation between universities and companies .
the proposal on which we are voting fits into this framework .
the protection and promotion of human and environmental health are priority objectives in european development policy .
bulgaria did not destroy its energy supply , but it affects neighbouring countries , since they stop receiving electricity .
however , the resale of atomic waste must be stopped .
however , I think that consideration must be given to the regionsvarying social and economic features .
this is also a necessity imposed by the demographic reality of today and the coming years .
i voted against this text , which is an insult to the citizens of europe .
however , the causes of these financial aberrations are not the causes identified by the rapporteur .
this is a situation which undermines productivity and economic competitiveness .
tax fairness and efficient government public spending are essential to the process of economic recovery and social cohesion .
after that , however , an inverse logic is introduced in specific proposals .
i am voting against this report .
on the other hand , I do not think that europe should promote the award of citizenship .
we certainly cannot achieve better financial market regulation by introducing a new tax .
let us not bring the citizens of europe to their knees .
after all , simplicity is one of the keys to efficiency .
this is crucial for economic development and growth in the different regions .
i have no doubt that small and medium sized enterprises have a crucial role in the success of building europe .
very specifically liberalisations , privatisations , and making employment laws less regulated and more flexible .
unfortunately , it did not receive a majority of the votes .
this was not surprising , given the vote in the committee .
historically , the mediterranean sea united rather than divided .
i am voting against this report .
i believe that the interests of european and mediterranean citizens should always take precedence over those of the financiers .
the role of elected representatives is to strive for the common good .
it is unfortunate that those who drafted this text did not make that their priority .
i voted for the resolution on theneed for an eu strategy for the south caucasus.
the south caucasus is strategically important to the european union .
we can use trade policy to promote respect for human rights , energy security , democracy and good governance .
there has been a conflict of interests in these places between russia , iran and turkey throughout this period .
for the aforementioned reasons , the gue / ngl group will abstain from the final vote on the resolution .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting see minutes
much , therefore , remains to be done .
a recent requirement now means that a note about religious identity also has to be included in passports .
violence against women continues to increase rapes , suicides , acid attacks and women being burned .
independent organisations representing working people and the poor are critical .
this respect for all religious minorities and , in particular , for christians , must be reinforced .
threats to journalists , cartoonists and artists are becoming more common and they challenge our liberal , democratic societies .
this takes the form of habitual persecution , cold blooded murder , discrimination and harassment at all levels of society .
such improvements have not been forthcoming , and the persecution continues .
these are empty words these days , especially for the estimated 15 million christians living in pakistan .
hundreds of pakistani christians vegetate in prison for years without access to any legal process .
pl there is an american saying that there are no free lunches .
hu if we examine the pakistani situation , we are faced with two incontrovertible facts .
we in the european parliament are fighting specifically for human rights throughout the world .
we now move to the catch the eye part of the debate .
i am going to take four speakers .
i was convinced that he was trying to establish mutual understanding among religious groups .
this surely cannot be an ideal way to promote mutual understanding between religious groups .
unfortunately , benazir bhutto was assassinated a few weeks prior to the elections .
pakistan's constitution recognises freedom of religion and provides that the state will protect the rights of minorities .
this is a step in the right direction , provided that these instruments are implemented effectively .
during these discussions , the eu has always insisted on respect for individual rights and minority rights .
these efforts must be encouraged .
the path to god and also the path from god is different and unique for each individual .
these values are important for the european parliament in their valuable relationship with thailand .
the train of events has passed very quickly over recent days and hours .
that is an undeniable right , and one that should be granted to all thai people .
it is time to stop the violence that has become widespread across the whole country .
these people are very critical of their unfair treatment and lack of rights .
in fact , it is the matter of the succession of the king that is being called into question .
until now , some areas of the capital were not affected by the conflict , but that has changed .
the situation in the north east is also chaotic .
the dramatic images convey one clear message .
mr tajani , the eu must take an active role and act as mediator .
the situation is all the more alarming as there are no real prospects of resolving the internal conflict .
there is the risk of these street clashes degenerating into civil war .
the thai government in particular must take responsibility for providing a calm and peaceful solution to this conflict .
madam president , honourable members , thailand is going through a tragic phase in its political history .
there is persistent uncertainty over the future of the country .
the commission has taken note of the roadmap put forward by prime minister abhisit vejjajiva .
thailand is going through a very serious period in its history .
the eu should use its good economic and political relations with thailand in order to bring about this solution .
burma
unfortunately , the election laws published do not provide for fair and free elections .
similarly , other international human rights organisations have been involved with the situation there .
the international community must act against the oppressors of the burmese people .
it should use all means to strengthen civil society and assist those who resist oppression in burma .
asian countries are encouraged to do the same and to use their economic leverage in the process .
there is also good news there .
we have to establish a clear policy of support for these people .
fi madam president , burma is holding its first parliamentary elections for 20 years .
buddhist monks have long been the target of a special kind of persecution .
the international community needs to make an effort to do something .
it is regrettable that the commission has cut funding for refugee camps on the border between thailand and burma .
civil society has been active .
we are also still very concerned about the human rights situation .
socio economic conditions are difficult for most of the population , especially in areas inhabited by ethnic groups .
our approach includes development aid in fact , the eu is one of the most generous donors .
the conditions needed for them to make a return to their countries do not exist .
in conclusion , I can confirm that we will redouble our efforts to promote our values .
we must be able to exert pressure on the commission , but preferably not under such strict time pressure .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place shortly .
burma

adjournment of the session
there is going to be an exhibition on this subject in brussels .
thank you for your understanding .
it can be said that this is one of the most citizen friendly accords .
our citizens understand this very well .
in the last two weeks , I have made official visits to greece and romania .
composition of parliament see minutes
signature of acts adopted under codecision see minutes
petitions see minutes
request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity developments see minutes
this is a huge qualitative change .
now we have to think carefully at first reading about what we really want to achieve .
we have two parallel processes which are at the same time slightly opposed to each other .
these two opposing processes are also being affected by the restrictions of the multiannual financial framework .
secondly , I support the principle of financial assistance to the main acp banana producing countries .
they just do not want to pay via the eu budget .
so , should we not make savings in the eu budget ?
there is no possibility of creating problems .
the report thus seeks to preserve the status quo and does not make real progress in any particular direction .
that could also enable us to make a very reasonable contribution .
it includes half a dozen flagship priority actions .
the time has come to show imagination and daring .
i think that is extremely important in this situation .
the first concerns youth policy .
my second point concerns the question of gaza .
i think that is wrong .
i therefore appeal to the rapporteur and the political groups to support these highly reasonable amendments .
germany has announced eur 60 billion of tax rises and spending cuts .
it is vital that we recognise what our member states are doing to control their own budgets .
we must approach our own with the same sense of responsibility and realism .
mr mészáros , it is connected with catch the eye .
i would also call for cost efficiency by using the synergies with national external action services .
hu thank you for the floor , mr president .
my own electoral district is also suffering enormously .
i would like to emphasise several fundamental values .
we still have a very important moment for reflection before us .
we have to realise this , and the discussion reflects this clearly .
outside the eu , financial aid for palestine is to be cut .
de mr president , my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur .
i believe that there is nothing more important for young europeans than the ability to use their skills .
mention was made here recently of the iter fusion reactor programme .
for this reason I urge my fellow members and those who are preparing the budget to consider this programme .
as always , the commission will try to act as an honest broker .
that is very important .
in summarising what you have said , I would like to mention several matters .
this must not happen .
this is why we also need self control .
a great deal can be achieved with relatively little funding in the areas relating to youth policy in particular .
think of trade , think of the common agricultural policy , think of the common fisheries policy .
so what I want to see is leadership from the eu .
2010 really is a milestone .
it is also critical that progress towards meeting the mdgs is robust and sustained .
once again my congratulations on parliament's mdgs report .
now mr cashman is saying and I entirely agree with him that we need more resources .
it is a fact of our time that no development is possible without security , and vice versa .
in addition to the autocratic regimes in uzbekistan and turkmenistan , ethnic violence recently broke out in kyrgyzstan .
dire straits , combined with instability and violence , may lead to a humanitarian catastrophe in the region .
if we need proof that no durable and sustainable development exists without security , we have it here .
history has yet to be written .
yet what we should really be talking about is a different means of coexistence , through fair trade .
somehow it still seems simpler to provide assistance than to undertake to stop undercutting african small farmers .
my group is quite happy to give 99.9 % support , with a few differences of opinion .
we keep talking about mdgs .
well actually there are eight millennium development goals , and I think we should have had more .
had we been able to do that , we would have been able to eliminate poverty faster .
europe has a great opportunity that of presenting itself as a world partner for development .
aspects of development policies can be found in all our committees , and we should be aware of that .
i would also like to highlight some problem areas in the cashman report .
finally , paragraph 42 deals with matters relating to our individual freedom of conscience .
our promises will not be met .
some countries are setting a good example , but my country , germany , does not look good .
a few minutes ago we were given the eurosceptic and selfish perspective that we needed to return to realism .
we therefore need additional resources to combat climate change and to help these countries adapt to climate change .
taxpayershard earned money must not disappear into mysterious channels .
de madam president , I would particularly like to thank mr cashman .
the millennium development goals should and can be achieved , and I say this with full responsibility .
it has been an interesting debate .
the council has made a positive contribution by introducing the annex containing the first new corridors .
this regulation marks a step forward in terms of making rail freight transport more efficient .
i must also express my thanks to mathieu grosch for the support he has given .
priority rules for trains are not something the commission will ever want to decide from brussels .
it is the practice of simply working together with other countries .
we would stress that passenger transport remains a priority , as laid down in 200we want transparent rules at the outset to prevent haphazard decisions being made in crucial situations .
but no , they do not want that !
for what is the reason for the poor fortunes of the railways ?
these are both basic factors for the competitiveness of the real economy in europe .
we do , however , want a one stop shop as a point of contact for customers .
i still find the current wording incomprehensible .
there are four problems , for example , with corridor 3 stockholm malmö copenhagen hamburg innsbruck verona naples palermo .
that is why we reject this report .
madam president , I am a strong supporter of the transport of freight by rail .
it is high time that we gave the operation of trains a higher political priority .
it is true that , beyond this text , there may be some problems here and there with infrastructure .
we certainly need this .
in my opinion , the result is an important one and one to be proud of .
of course , the present regulation is just one means to improve the competitiveness of rail freight transport .
other necessary measures include optimising the operation of the market and promoting intermodal transport .
on the contrary , it complements their work and ensures better coordination .
i come from germany , where it would be terrible if freight transport took priority over passenger transport .
that would have a very negative effect on local public passenger transport .
this is something that we want as well as need .
there are completely different opinions on this .
that is the only source of dissent that we have .
it is obvious that this might reduce the competitiveness of rail transport .
es madam president , we have just returned from the ten t days held in zaragoza recently .
therefore , the proposed compromise that is on the table should , in my opinion , be rejected .
madam president , firstly , the european union does an awful lot of good work .
only last week we saw success at the european court of justice on roaming rates .
if I may use a pun , you are on the right track the railway track !
keep it going and have as much success as you had with the roaming charges .
this is one of the two conditions .
it would open up the possibility of linking with various sea ports in the mediterranean .
i expect clear information about this construction project .
i think this text has the potential to culminate in an ambitious european project .
in the light of this debate , let me insist once again on two issues .
the commission thinks it will be very good for europe if this proposal could be voted strongly tomorrow .
the compromise is supported by at least four political groups .
it is also supported by the commission and a statement to this effect will also be made tomorrow .
the compromise is supported by the european associations of hauliers and infrastructure managers .
the current compromise has been achieved as a result of difficult negotiations .
conciliation cannot give us any more than we have now .
this is the first to see the light of day .
in the original trial both the charge and sentence were delivered orally .
strengthening safeguards and defence rights is not at all about being soft on crime .
they are indispensable to promote real mutual trust between the judicial authorities of different member states .
that is why I warmly welcome the agreement reached by the two co legislators .
this is in accordance with the lisbon treaty and with the stockholm programme .
as you know , the commission is already working on the subsequent road map measures .
an agreement could not be reached and negotiations were abandoned in june 200finally , we have the initiative from the 13 member states .
the text we are due on wednesday to vote on makes significant improvements to the member statesproposal .
the way was open , and it was temporarily blocked by the election of the new commission .
parliament made amendments to the commission's work .
i wish to thank the rapporteur for her excellent teamwork with all our shadow rapporteurs .
therefore this translation directive is a fig leaf .
that is what matters .
i am now speaking on behalf of the european free alliance meps , representing regions and minorities .
i stress that the directive also applies to non official languages of the european union .
that is important for jurisprudence , too .
de madam president , this report represents progress for europe .
we need to create trust .
my constituent andrew symeou has been held for 11 months awaiting trial in the greek prison of korydallos .
the british court is not even allowed to consider the so called evidence against them .
we are now in a very peculiar period .
we are coming out of the third pillar and find ourselves in a normal codecision situation .
i strongly agree with vice president reding about the three year implementation period .
i say to ukip that there is no call to get nationalistic about the quality of justice .
i hope the new government returns fully to the rule of law .
i ask that the directive be passed unamended and quickly so that it gets on the statute book .
he was brought back within six weeks .
the debate is closed .
the reason why estonia should join the eurozone is straightforward .
estonia has met the maastricht criteria laid down in the treaties .
finally , this is not to say that an easy economic path ahead lies ahead for estonia .
i also want to congratulate our estonian friends on reaching this important milestone .
i appreciate the overwhelming support for estonia's euro adoption given by parliament's econ committee on 2 june .
this leadership goes beyond simply putting their house in order and making the sacrifices that go with that .
the experience from my country another small country has been almost entirely beneficial .
we would be truly lost .
there has to be some way of dealing with that .
then it will be a little less than a month before the council's official decision .
we have realised that , in a small country with an open economy , there is no other option .
the council will also take its decision without any political benefit .
it shows that there are still countries that have real confidence in this european project .
i would like to ask the commission to provide some clarity in this regard .
they prepared the ground , in fact , for today's euro crisis .
the introduction of the euro in estonia would be good news on three fronts .
thank you for your attention .
it has been able to tackle it with prompt austerity and fiscal discipline measures .
difficult times separate the wheat from the chaff .
the euro is the most visible symbol of a united europe .
let us , for example , recall the excellent tax reforms which they instituted .
the next item is the one minute speeches on matters of political importance .
many deaths have been recorded , while the health of thousands of people is at risk .
the very first legal act of the new hungarian parliament was an act on dual citizenship .
this is a gross violation of the european principle of friendly coexistence of nations .
all military conflicts on our continent have been preceded by such comments .
the european parliament and ministers will be giving more power to eurostat to audit member statesbudgets .
some members may be aware of the recent murder of bobby moffat .
i would like to make it clear , however , that we are not against the agreement .
together with poland , hungary and the czech republic , slovakia is also hugely affected by the flood waves .
the solidarity of the european union is thus extremely important at the moment .
it also has to modernise the infrastructure of the sea and river ports .
madam president , I rise to draw attention to the blockade in the indian state of manipur .
highway 39 , which links the state to the rest of india , has been blockaded since 12 april .
hu this month we are commemorating the 90th anniversary of the signing of the treaty of trianon .
these proposals must be supported simultaneously by innovative measures to help reduce material losses caused by flooding .
the cuban regime responded cynically and declared that it would not give in to international pressure .
indeed a lot has changed in recent years , but cuba's oppressive dictatorship has remained .
we believe that this is inherently unjust .
therefore , madam president , I am also appealing to the european institutions to intervene .
i have already approached the european commission to ask for this intervention .
all these are fundamental elements that will be taken into account by the italian parliament .
incredibly , dublin city has been selected as the european capital of sport 2010 !
derivatives markets future policy actions short presentation 
thus , we will only be able to solve the problem if we solve the debt problems .
in this respect , central counterparties help preserve the integrity of the stock market .
thirdly , the conditions under which clearing houses in third countries can offer these services in europe .
how should we regulate them ?
however , we will continue to work on this issue .
that is why we presented three different options with regard to trade repositories in our consultation .
mr langen , responsibility in the areas of supervision and authorisation is linked to tax liability .
internet of things short presentation 
this is only the beginning .
pl madam president , the internet of things is part of the digital agenda .
el madam president , I should like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work .
how good will the security be ?
so congratulations for the pioneering role in pointing out the key challenges of the internet of things .
and we certainly must avoid people feeling that the internet of things was pushed upon them .
i think that was one of those challenges that parliament as well as the commission is facing .
written statements rule 149 
however , this self regulation is not working in the way that we would like it to .
from a security perspective , self regulation is no longer acceptable .
pl I would like to offer my congratulations on this report .
however , let us remember the most important things , chiefly associated with the protection of minors .
the vote will take place tomorrow tuesday 15 june 2010 .
our thanks to all the interpreters and staff .
i therefore welcome european financial support which will enable romania to guarantee every household internet access .

mr zapatero , you have the floor .
i would like to emphasise that we have produced results of great significance during this period .
it will contain many more prevention mechanisms in the face of what may be systemic risks .
it is a better treaty .
however , it is a treaty that requires great political will from all 27 member states .
applause 
thank you very much for that .
europe 2020 is our agenda for the european social market economy in the 21st century .
in addition , they provide us with a structure for driving and verifying progress .
the next challenge for all of us is to translate these into actual results .
it is a critical political signal .
all three institutions must now make decisive moves to seal the package before the summer break .
the presidency has helped prepare an unprecedented number of summits with europe's strategic partners in the world .
applause 
the credit for this expressly belongs to parliament and the spanish presidency .
we have made considerable progress in this respect in these last few days .
besides , we must have a leading role for europe .
they turn to where they believe they can make their profit quickest .
this is also a step in the right direction .
that is why I believe that the rotating presidency has proved its worth .
overall , the spanish presidency was a successful presidency .
i must say , however , on behalf of my group , that we are disappointed with the result .
the crisis has shown that this approach has failed .
the taxpayer is unable and unwilling to rescue the banking system one more time .
in the council , they behave as if the lisbon strategy had not failed due to mistaken ideas .
that is precisely the case , however .
the open method of coordination broke down .
a jobs and growth strategy aiming for success must be based on the community method .
the new strategy does not do this to a sufficient degree .
the us eu summit and the meeting of the union for the mediterranean were cancelled .
we can all agree on that , can we not ?
good .
yes , but what sort of growth ?
those who want growth cannot only get growth by saving .
where today is europe speaking about investment ?
i have not heard it mentioned once in any of the speeches .
you can announce as many sanctions as you want , they will be of no avail .
i have heard nothing about that today not a word .
i would like to reiterate something with regard to swift .
that is nonsense , since the police have to work with each other .
i believe that after six months . well , we will have to see after the next few presidencies .
we should have the clarity of mind to discuss this problem in the future .
there is great consensus .
the president cut off the speaker 
the suggested solution is that the owners can have their houses legalised for a fee .
he continued to be late and unsuccessful .
the lesson from this is clear .
the president cut off the speaker 
unfortunately , it is apparent that in external policy , spain was not up to the task .
nonetheless , I thank you and congratulate you for your work in the council .
the spanish presidency has left no enduring traces , mr zapatero .
we have no concrete progress on the stability and growth pact .
that would assist the inner coherence of your argument .
applause 
it is the spanish presidency that we are discussing .
applause 
to use a footballing expression , felipe gonzález would certainly have scored with this ball .
as a result , today , the international financial markets remain closed to a great many spanish companies .
i see that you agree with thefinal solutionfor catalan .
in which documents have you established the mediterranean axis as a priority ?
many of us have spent a lot longer putting up with this model .
previously , the council has refused to lay adequate accounts before the european parliament .
this success of the spanish presidency testifies to the democratic and european convictions of the spanish government .
the reality is that it was the government of spain that urgently needed to fulfil its obligations .
at best , this presidency has been sadly irrelevant .
the spanish presidency delivered what was expected concerning the most important institutional issues .
next to these seemingly technical issues , the presidential programme of our spanish friends did not lack policy ambitions .
the spanish also met high expectations on democratic rights .
congratulations !
this is something which causes us very great concern .
i salute the workers of spain for fighting these cuts with strong strike action .
earlier , we heard criticism about issues relating to spanish property .
that is what we , in the british labour delegation , want to do .
these problems will now have to be taken on , too , by the belgian presidency .
important meetings have fallen through , and it was only possible to agree on stop gap measures .
regarding the spanish presidency , I think that the dynamic is all wrong in terms of judging it .
applause 
yes , yes , let us look at the facts .
i reject it utterly .
applause 
we have felt supported by you , mr president .
we have felt understood by you , encouraged by you .
applause 
how would the rotating presidency interpret the treaty of lisbon ?
this commission is less than five months old .
thank you , mr barroso .
once again , I would like to thank the spanish presidency and mr zapatero .
moreover , what they did in relation to the sovereign debt is very serious .
the list of the greatest powers is becoming increasingly limited to germany and , at best , france .
the slow solutions were subsequently of poor quality .
the approval of the europe 2020 strategy will mean taking the same approach .
i congratulate the spanish presidency on the past six months of leadership of the union .
i am sure that the spanish presidency's need for discussion is about to come to an end .
one can never attain 100 % , however , when one has four negotiating partners .
the new agreement was approved on 28 june 20article 18 is a good article .
article 12 represents a second improvement .
europol has experience with data protection rules , and we must assume that this was a good choice .
i would like to thank all of you wholeheartedly .
this has been a serious situation and I am relieved that we are now closing this security gap .
i must especially thank the rapporteurs for having done a good job .
tomorrow in my constituency of london , we celebrate the anniversary of the 7 / 7 bombing .
we all know what this agreement is about , but balance is critical .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the opposite of good is good intentions .
parliament has had to push hard to be heard and for its voice to be respected .
it represents for us the future possibility of our own eu tftp system .
the american law is not changing it is not passing through congress .
european citizens residing in the united states of america are discriminated against because of such an agreement .
yet , they then present us with the crucial issue concerning the role of europol .
europol is an agency which must be controlled because it benefits from this agreement .
we know that this is wrong we know that it is both illegal and unconstitutional .
this is a problem that will come back to haunt us continually in the years to come .
you have created an illegal state and now you are making illegal laws !
look at the way that this was done .
under the act , such information cannot be shared without the consent of the individuals concerned .
britain's representative on the council appears to have overridden existing national law in order to reach this agreement .
this is just the latest example of how the eu is creating an undemocratic , illegitimate political state .
we have shown that privacy and security do not need to be played off against each other .
this is not a zero sum game .
i believe that this is precisely the kind of balance that our law abiding citizens expect from us .
de mr president , a preliminary remark .
nonetheless , not everything was achieved .
for example , europol .
this agreement has serious shortcomings which leave it open to legal challenge .
this agreement is therefore no reason for jubilation , but it is the least bad option .
putting an end to the bulk data transfer in the longer term is major progress that we should recognise .
for they say , quite tersely , that narrowing it down to single individuals is currently not technically possible .
an increase in data protection is thus nowhere in sight in this agreement .
the voice of the european parliament is making itself heard negotiations have taken place .
this agreement is both different and better than the one which we rejected in february .
hu I will indeed keep this one short .
in my opinion , the changes that were made to this agreement are not entirely convincing .
the new version of the agreement provides better protection of european citizensrights .
we must keep a close eye on this balance .
a system of our own has been proposed , and this will be worked on .
you may or may not like this agreement .
i believe that we have hereby opened a new era in the sphere of eu lawmaking .
now I turn to my fellow members who have just spoken in opposition .
the vote will take place on thursday , 8 july , at 12 00 .
τhe next item is the vote .
and that is a major victory for europe and for the future of transatlantic relations .
the contents of this agreement are testament to these new institutional relations .
the re hashed swift agreement does very little to change this situation .
the data will be arbitrarily stored for a full five years .
citizens would first have to cope with the cost of instituting legal proceedings in the united states !
what was first celebrated as a success for the european parliament in february has now become a washout .
request for defence of mr valdemar tomaševski's parliamentary immunity 
what does the european parliament want in addition ?
rights of passengers when travelling by sea and inland waterway

annual report of the petitions committee 2009

that concludes the vote .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
explanations of vote
we had the hubris of the boom years when we pretended that greek and german debt were interchangeable .
now we have the nemesis of the overdue market correction .
this would meet our goal .
lt I voted for this document and am delighted that it has been adopted .
lv I refer , therefore , to the strategy for the baltic sea region .
thank you .
why is that ?
surely we could do just as well running our own affairs in our own interest ?
sk I fully support mr cancian's report on passenger rights in bus and coach transport .
equal access to transport is one of the fundamental preconditions for an independent life .
i am particularly concerned about the area of rural transport .
maritime goods transport is indeed subject to very complex administrative procedures .
a precise and detailed directive which reduces the possibility of different interpretations as much as possible is therefore necessary .
to this end , I hope for a good level of cooperation between the various competent authorities involved .
it is not , however , enough on its own .
instead , we need very practical action .
then there are the objectives of the european union's eu 2020 strategy .
the situation varies from one eu member state to another .
therefore , adequate legal regulation is required at european union level .
written explanations of vote
the paris convention can only be signed by the member states , not by the european union .
i am very much in favour of a technical measure to facilitate the staging of international exhibitions .
nevertheless , it is a good example .
it also precisely regulates individual countriescustoms regulations for the imported goods .
for exhibitors , this means a considerable simplification of entry procedures .
the european union itself cannot accede to the paris convention , as only sovereign states can be parties thereto .
the iczm protocol has already been approved on behalf of the european union .
the eu has already put its name to many environmental and animal welfare instruments .
eu member states with access to the sea are already iczm members , however .
it also sets forth several provisions regarding economic activities related to tourism , fishing and aquaculture .
in 2007 , it was decided to incorporate this treaty into the legal framework of the eu .
i am voting in favour of this agreement between the european union and iceland and norway .
the commission should exert all efforts to end the continuing delays with sis ii .
once more , the right of opinion is violated under the pretext of security .
our every effort to strengthen frontex is therefore to be welcomed .
i am opposed to the existence and overall modus operandi of frontex .
however , the way in which they participate must be defined through agreements with the european union .
its principal role is to coordinate operations between member states relating to the management of its external borders .
thank you .
in my opinion , the eu's handling of the migration phenomenon truly brings shame on europe .
this has my unconditional support .
this situation is reprehensible , unacceptable and scandalous .
the karas report is in line with the european response to the greek crisis .
accurate , credible statistical data is a prerequisite for the economic and monetary union to operate properly .
this report advocates absolute respect for the stability and growth pact .
this kind of thing must never happen again .
i therefore voted in favour of this report .
if the previous data is known , there is no need for additional arguments .
harmonisation of statistical data collection 
i supported this report .
this macro region will not be competing with the member states it will complement them .
this new form of governance will undeniably bring added value to local , national and european policies .
there are two major areas of interest for this region the environment and scientific development .
throughout these regions , they are aiming once again to dismantle the welfare state .
in the eu , it is important to have a macro regional vision of the baltic sea region .
in writing . the eu strategy holds enormous potential for us and our neighbours within several policy areas .
optimal results can only be achieved with the pooling of resources towards commonly defined goals .
the implementation of the strategy has been slow so far .
the european institutions , in particular the european commission , should fulfil their role of providing coordination and support .
these measures can be financed by the payments committee of the european social fund .
the structural funds are essential for investment in areas that contribute to improving productivity , and to economic growth .
this is a guideline which frames and enhances the eu 2020 strategy for intelligent , sustainable and inclusive growth .
cohesion policy , through the structural funds and other actions , is of prime importance .
i fully welcome this report .
this is to be done within the regional policy budgetary framework .
however , it seemed preferable to me to abstain on amendment all of this had to do with a vote at second reading .
very many bus services in ireland are run by local carriers , small businesses and family businesses .
we note that the approved changes also improve on the previous version , by guaranteeing , in particular 
that carriers need to heed the appropriate access conditions for people with disabilities and those with restricted mobility 
i am sure that the council has taken note of our determination .
therefore , we have voted in favour .
in writing . the concerns with the report voted are the following 
i also appreciate the fact that exceptional circumstances were taken into account in this report .
these passengers should also have the opportunity to submit compensation claims .
however , we do not consider european legislation to be the right instrument for protecting passenger rights .
the netherlands itself is best placed to make tailored policy .
as is the case with the airline industry , passengers deserve to be protected against disruption .
i hope that an acceptable compromise can be reached in conciliation .
the effectiveness of using information and communications technology in the sphere of road transport is indisputable .
the correct functioning of the internal market must be ensured .
i voted for this document , because it would accelerate the implementation of intelligent transport system solutions .
if intelligent traffic systems are actually implemented , they must be interoperable .
the agreement with the council was thus adopted and the directive has been finalised at first reading .
the eu airline industry is already in dire straits .
better performance and higher environmental standards are being sought in this report .
in my opinion , definite targets must be set if significant results are to be achieved .
the transport sector is very important for trying to establish the european common market .
the reality is a bit different , however .
i would therefore like to point out that the decarbonisation of transport should be a priority .
in this context , it is worth noting the possibility of internalising external costs .
i endorsed the final version of the report .
the verts / ale group voted in favour .
we support the resolution despite the risks posed by overly extremist stances already taken by parliament .
we must balance the need to protect the environment with the current economic crisis we are experiencing .
we look positively on the heavy emphasis on safety .
it also boosts employment .
i was pleased to hear the results of today's vote .
parliament is directly elected by the public .
through its committee on petitions , parliament investigates and seeks to resolve any infringements .
this is therefore an instrument of democracy and citizenship .
of course , this is not just a question of affirming these objectives loudly and clearly .
the impact of this has been heaviest on young people and persons approaching the age of retirement .
a coherent combination of educational , financial , social and employment policies is required .
people under 25 are the first to be affected by the current economic crisis .
we believe that this gives a wrong message .
from then on , remuneration should also be paid .
the decision made today is impracticable and goes too far .
this sends out a clear signal to our young europeans .
that is why I voted as I did .
the actual process of getting on the job ladder is becoming increasingly difficult .
insecure jobs mean that we should not be surprised at low birth rates .
it sketches new ways to curb youth unemployment .
the report was adopted with a large majority in favour .
europe must have the courage to invest in those businesses which do not relocate but create jobs .
addressing this is an important task for responsible politicians .
with 21.4 % of young europeans under 25 unemployed , it is definitely time to take action .
in lithuania , last year , every eleventh young person was unemployed compared to every twenty fourth in 200we need to boost youth employability by helping adapt educational skills to labour market needs .
support measures such as quality internships , apprenticeships and traineeships can aid a smooth transition from education to employment .
for lithuania , it is vital to prevent an increasing brain drain of skilled labour .
i voted in favour of the gruny report , whose aim is to launch a vast european employment initiative .
the first relates to the need for increased investment in skills and professional and lifelong training .
the crisis should not serve as a pretext for the development of more precarious employment .
society has evolved , the world has changed , and labour relations must necessarily accompany this change .
the eu cannot abandon its european social model , but should rather strengthen it .
the crisis must not serve as a pretext for the development of casual work .
today's labour market and its associated employment relationships are characterised by one word flexicurity .
i today voted in favour of the gruny own initiative report on atypical employment contracts in the eu .
the incidence of atypical employment contracts is increasing significantly in the european union .
there must not be two classes of employment contract .
that resolution did not make it , and parliament passed up an opportunity to construct a stronger social europe .
this is a matter that must instead be dealt with at a national level .
to achieve this objective , citizens themselves need to be involved .
effective bio waste management can contribute to the eu target of at least 20 % renewable energy by 20selective collection and recycling of bio waste is essential to europe's sustainable development .
europeans now understand the need to sort waste .
although we broadly agree with these principles , we cannot , however , neglect to point out some problems .
the question unanswered in the report is who will pay ?
as regards composting , it is not enough to say that we need to do it .
action must be taken at the eu level and today's vote should ensure that progress is made .
this report takes the right approach .
i will therefore abstain .

economic governance in the eu and the eurozone , and surveillance of national budgets debate 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , economic governance constitutes a crucial challenge for the future of our union .
these proposals do not involve changing the treaty .
our citizens , our businesses and our economy are demanding that we take initiatives .
it is our responsibility to decide and to act now .
our response to the crisis is a holistic one .
we stabilise , we consolidate and we modernise .
but for now , let me focus on governance .
we have the treaty provisions in place which allow us to act .
we have the institutions .
we need to make it work .
i hope that this will translate later into a swift consideration and swift adoption of legislative proposals .
our approach to economic governance is to have rules that are more comprehensive and more efficient .
second , we need the credibility that comes with better enforcement .
we must not fall into the trap of waiting too long before sanctions kick in .
it must not be restricted to fiscal policy alone .
i would like to underline the historic dimension of the reforms we are putting forward .
this is a strategy for the whole union . this is not just an addition of different strategies .
president barroso , commissioner rehn , your proposals are an important step towards strengthening economic governance in europe .
important reforms and painful measures in the member states are necessary in order to strengthen their competitiveness .
you called the series of measures atoolbox.
you have left out several highly relevant options that would really mean a qualitative leap in this field .
second , you must come forward with an economic policy agenda for jobs and fiscal consolidation .
today , we only have an agenda for cutting deficits at the expense of jobs .
i hope you will reconsider and come forward with a more balanced set of proposals in the autumn .
the commission has the initiative here .
nevertheless , mr president , some questions remain concerning this package .
this is a crucial point .
furthermore , this element is repeated in the commission's proposals .
until recently , it was still almost impossible to talk about imbalances seriously .
unfortunately , this does not feature in the text .
we have problems with asset prices and bubbles .
both the commission and council are calling for further controls and penalties for member states in deficit .
this may stall growth in the euro area , which is still feeble and at risk .
i think you had an urgent appointment .
to suggest now that we have only just found out that greece was broke is intellectually dishonest .
there is a predominant sense of constructive pragmatism on both sides .
i believe it now appears within grasp .
we now call on both colegislators to maintain the positive dynamic .
great , and we welcome that .
that could only enhance the role of europe in this matter .
at the last european council , I made a strong plea to make the results public .
however , control mechanisms are not a solution but just a means .
the key to the solution is prevention .
special attention should be paid to budgetary frameworks and the state debts .
i also encourage making better use of eurostat .
at this stage , and with the huge crisis we are suffering , there are only two possibilities .
the president of the ecb will also be the chair of the esrb and represent the esrb externally .
to close my speech , this is not time for a debate on a second order reform .
the trialogues began the following day .
all competences and powers have been incorporated into the sectoral legislation .
this is the decision we have come to now in parliament .
the key point remains if a real financial crisis breaks out , who declares the emergency ?
since then , the commission has done its work .
it commissioned a report from jacques de larosière .
we also want these authorities to be located in a single place , for reasons of efficiency .
on this matter , we have also made some requests .
i also notice that a number of governments are having discussions in two stages .
madam president , cassandra had a gift that of telling the future .
exotic products , unknown even to their creators , flooded the markets .
now what ?
what does it mean to say that they are european ?
this governs everything except systemic institutions .
lifeboats should be made ready before the voyage , not in the middle of a storm .
parliament has given it time .
those who are not cassandra know only too well to whom I refer .
it remains the most comprehensive piece of sectoral financial services legislation voted on in this parliament .
as such , solvency ii is intimately linked with the proposals for eiopa .
eiopa , in my opinion , provides the oil that will allow solvency ii to operate more effectively .
it is perhaps because of my experience with solvency ii that I was keen to take on this report .
this entire process takes time for 27 member states .
i will come back to this when talking about mr karasreport .
we find here the spirit and the philosophy of the commission's proposals .
you can count on me to be available .
that is the spirit of the toolbox that we will be presenting to the council of ministers .
there have been different approaches adopted at national level .
this means he can issue warnings , make recommendations , and all of this in public .
madam president , commissioners , european supervision of financial markets is the minimum that we can do .
we must have global supervision of financial markets .
equally , the new european framework must radically improve both the quality and coherence of regulatory supervision .
our member states are right to resist such a move .
the problem has already been explained .
we are dealing with markets which operate globally nowadays .
this is the task to which we have committed ourselves as the european parliament .
all of this does not seem to me to amount to extremism .
here lies the essence of the entire debate on financial architecture and the supervision of financial architecture .
we have currency union .
mr giegold is right when he described what is currently going on asparochial.
we will get a fragmented supervisory structure which will be incapable of exercising proper control over the financial markets .
they are expecting this predatory financial market capitalism to be tamed and the dominance of politics to be restored .
my group supports strong european regulation .
de madam president , the european union already has around 40 eu agencies .
in this debate on european supervision , parliament has played this role .
why is this ?
however , this is only a start .
they are also concentrating more on substance than on a turf war .
well , the solution is quite easy .
in italy , for example , it happens via a system of local branches which can monitor situations well .
i am glad that it appears that we are close to agreement .
we should all , and the rapporteurs themselves , be very proud .
they must not degenerate into empty shells which passively observe market developments .
there has certainly been no lack of preparatory work by the responsible meps .
hu the crisis has taught us all some painful lessons .
the new supervisory authorities will serve exactly this purpose .
parliament should also make concessions .
i am thinking of international public banking establishments and , in particular , of the european investment bank .
we need independent , strong authorities in the interest of europeans .
we need strong supervision with teeth , a right of intervention and a mediator function .
we need decisions without further notice in emergencies .
let us remember to link the responsibility of the union to the responsibility of all member states .
these intervention rights are restricted to absolutely exceptional cases and will hopefully never be used .
after all , germany has been a better model of financial propriety than many others .
mrs bowles reminded us of the need for early intervention measures .
mrs lulling mentioned a point which is of interest to my colleague , olli rehn .
that must be embarked upon , mr giegold , well before we talk about a ban .
this has to do with the transatlantic calibration that I sometimes mention .
i am not worried about the energetic interaction between americans and europeans .
the other regions of the world are there , between the americans and the europeans .
they will now need to open the drawers one by one to implement these decisions .
i think that there are real parallels between the americans and the europeans .
in the united states , it is the other way around .
we do not always have the same banking structures .
i hope that this signal is also clearly understood by the absent council .
mr president , commissioner , I would like to say three things .
let us be quite clear .
my second remark has to do with the date .
the president cut off the speaker 
however , I do not necessarily agree with you on international financial accounting .
the joint debate is closed .
written statements rule 149 
we are the devils that look at the detail , and we want more of it .
can you confirm that the rules of the spv are being changed to permit this ?
is this all the right way around ?
market forces are not popular right now .
mrs bowles mentioned angels .
i do not know if there are many angels when we talk of financial services .
what is the link with the ceiling on own resources ?
the second question will the commission carry out an impact analysis for these two instruments ?
notably , it will include an impact evaluation of the text .
the third question what is the impact on the financial capacities of the eib ?
the financial stabilisation mechanism illustrates the urgency of financial market reforms .
in the meantime , the markets have done their job .
we now move on to the speakers in the catch the eye procedure .
besides , the issue arises concerning the dependency of rating agencies .
these ideas will also be turned into legislative proposals at the end of 2010 and the start of 20mrs berès mentioned the application of the stability pact .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 7 july 2010 at 12 00 .
the next item is the joint debate on 
to begin with , it is important to exercise and expand sound internal and external supervision of remuneration policies .
i think that that is fair .
i have just referred to crd 3 and the issue of remuneration .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the council is again absent .
during the negotiations , the council came out on the side of the bonus recipients .
we are in favour of liability .
we do not want cash amounts to be higher than the tied up capital .
we have managed to get our way with splitting the timetable .
it is also important that we have adapted the trading book and banking book .
it is therefore a positive move that we are now establishing legislation that is both clear and practicable .
under capitalised trading books were a fundamental cause of the crisis , making speculative proprietary trading attractive and almost cost free .
madam president , commissioner , my political group is particularly delighted that this directive has been adopted .
therefore , I think that this is an achievement which we can share .
as we lost , we have had to make compromises .
we have here a regulation which is unique on a global scale .
it is clear that we need principles that promote and create guidelines for a sound remuneration policy .
the financial crisis is obviously a global crisis .
this means that if we tighten capital requirements , we must coordinate this measure internationally too .
it will not be that easy to put an end to this .
the attempt to make management executives more accountable with retentions was thwarted by new insurance policies .
the factors determining the bonuses must definitely be transparent .
madam president , I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the commission .
clear rules have been implemented which cannot be interpreted in different ways .
i should now like to say a few words about the application of these new rules .
they must apply to all investment banking firms .
mrs bowles mentioned the central issue of capitalisation , as did mr balz a short while ago .
they have been set by the gwe must achieve them in parallel , and I shall be careful to ensure that this does indeed happen .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , I too shall keep it brief .
it cannot be the end of the story .
part one
this implies that their involvement was necessary and in keeping with the nature of jtis as public private partnerships .
let me describe an actual case .
subject european union accession to the european convention on human rights
pl thank you , mr šemeta , for your answer .
well , let us hope that it does not take too long !
the president cut off the speaker 
mr kelly , perhaps you could restate your question very briefly if you would not mind .
does the commission agree with that statement ?
we are now dealing with the current package , which includes three directives , and the issue of lichtenstein .
you yourself come from a wonderful region of europe , euregio egrensis .
member of the commission . it would , indeed , be one of my priorities in this region .
it is unacceptable for this to be entered on parliament's list in an official debate .
has turkey made any commitment to sign the protocol in 2010 ?
mr gallagher , I am asking one of the staff to come round to talk to you .
it is important to stress that we were not to know , as questioners , that this would happen .
if you want to be patient and wait , we will see how we get on .
as mentioned earlier , this is an issue for internal cypriot dialogue .
subject middle east peace
does the commission intend to reward countries that have made progress in complying with european standards ?
on top of this , hundreds of local authorities are becoming fair trade towns .
one of their biggest assets is that they are non governmental in nature .
subject eu colombia free trade agreement
it is not yet clear whether the national parliaments would also be called on to approve the agreements .
the high representative has described human rights as a silver thread that will run through all our external policy .
in the end , it is a political assessment .
you know what the remedies are they are the right ones .
novel foods debate 
innovation is all well and good , but not at the expense of human life and health .
a food should not reach our plates unless its safety is guaranteed .
cloned animals are often crippled or diseased , and most are not even alive when they are born .
therefore , I make an emphatic call for separate legislation on the cloning of animals .
regarding animal cloning , I share the importance that parliament attaches to this highly sensitive issue .
i hope and trust that this will be the case .
we represent citizens and we must not forget this fact .
transparency should also apply when we speak about the labelling of products from animals fed by gmos .
i hope the commission does keep its promise to produce not just a report but an actual legislative proposal .
can these things affect our health ?
who actually wants these new initiatives ?
is it the industry that wants to sell more products ?
or is it really the consumer ?
unfortunately , however , the reality is much duller .
need I remind you that the technology being used to obtain such food is still experimental in many respects .
the population is very evidently against it , as stated by all the surveys .
it contains so many unanswered questions , justifying this sense of unease .
we had an interesting debate too on this regulation , which was also filled with controversy .
this would not conform to the concept of the internal market and the uniformity of health and living conditions .
we are not calling for a ban on gmos and nanomaterials .
a great deal has already been said about meat from cloned animals .
please take into account the rather difficult situation currently facing farmers and ensure fair competition for european farmers .
we certainly do need it .
however , we should avoid demonising this new technology , as has often happened in the past .
i am astounded at the information that is already available and at the research that has been carried out .
the citizens of europe have a right to demand that .
meat from cloned animals is definitely not a priori harmful .
however , risks cannot always be excluded either .
we only know that this technique causes suffering , hurt and pain to animals , which is often avoidable .
stringent regulations and quality standards are constantly being imposed on and implemented by the agricultural sector in europe .
the precautionary principle must apply in particular in the food sector .
we do not need meat from cloned animals for the sake of food supply security .
there are a whole range of reasons why we do not need this meat from cloned animals .
at present , the european group of ethics does not see convincing arguments to justify .
nanotechnologies have become widely used in food processing across the world .
absolutely not .
this is not a valid argument .
can a consumer clearly understand and choose which is meat from a cloned animal and which is not ?
it took centuries to work out that penicillin could come from mould .
does europe , perchance , say yes to everything ?
the president cut off the speaker 
the safety assessment would be carried out by efsa and the authorisation decision taken by the commission .
amendments 
indeed , much has been said about this , but the novel foods regulation is about very much more .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 149 
only if this is guaranteed can new products be authorised for sale in the eu .
industrial emissions integrated pollution prevention and control recast debate 
i would like to emphasise two aspects .
the first is the environmental requirements in industrial plants .
what we are talking about here is the better implementation of best available techniques in europe .
i have heard many arguments in this debate .
this directive represents a significant step forward in the control of industrial pollution in the european union .
this places germany at a competitive disadvantage compared to others .
this is an argument that can apply to many aspects of environmental legislation .
we have reached , in the end , what is an acceptable compromise .
member states are not particularly happy .
i hope mr eickhout's unhappiness is mitigated later but , nevertheless , it is a good overall result .
this is also the approach we support for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions .
if we do our work on time , then we can also carry out innovations and still protect jobs .
cs it is clearly very important to press for reductions in emissions of hazardous substances by industry .
adoption of the krahmer report will put enterprises in a difficult situation .
this should be made to apply only to new investments .
installations which come under the remit of this directive must be authorised .
the agricultural sector therefore has a leading role to play in climate and environmental protection .
ro I approve of the compromise text resulting from the trialogues .
the disparities between member states in terms of enforcing the legislation and monitoring this enforcement have been removed .
these derogations concern cases where investment costs outweigh environmental benefits .
flexibility is still possible but must now be clearly justified .
we should also look to a positive side of the agenda that we also gain a technological advantage .
the fact is that we are moving .
that also does not happen every day .
i wanted to talk about two aspects of the debate to which I have just been able to listen .
those which do not do this will become less competitive .
no one , including this law , is demanding that an industrial enterprise should be switched off tomorrow .
the vote will take place tomorrow , wednesday , 7 july 2010 , at 12 00 .
at the moment , we are witnessing tentative development of alternative energy resources in certain regions .
this maintains considerable dependency on fossil fuels .
we must find solutions enabling us to invest in state of the art energy production facilities in the least polluting way possible .
it is also requested to support and monitor the member states in implementing the measures .
however , it should be emphasised that not all member states are able to implement it .
losses to industry may be as high as pln 50 billion .
implementation of the directive will also have an adverse effect on thousands of polish businesses .
this is four years shorter than poland had expected .
forests are of vital importance in maintaining biodiversity and in global climate and water cycles .
we must not impose higher requirements on timber than we do on oil , for example .
secondly , it must be possible to implement the legislation .
we must not prevent other countries that are currently poor from exporting and trading .
many of my objections have been heard , for which I am very grateful .
this is a very important signal on the part of the european union , and should not be underestimated .
deforestation both legal and , in particular , illegal remains a major problem in the world .
as far as I am concerned , this is a great victory for democracy .
it has been a pleasure working with her .
we would do well not to underestimate the success there .
i would like to highlight one of the very welcome side effects .
it follows on nicely from what jan was just saying .
we are therefore also talking about the transfer of wealth from the producer to the countries consuming this timber .
this report takes a very important step in this direction by defining prohibitions on timber trading .
good intentions are not enough either .
i hope that , with this proposal , we will be able to prevent that from happening .
it is important for our citizens , judging by my postbag and the number of e mails I have received .
it fuelled the war in cambodia in the 1990s and it is the enemy of democracy .
i would like to thank the commissioner for going further than his predecessors .
he was sympathetic , but his services and lawyers said it could not be done .
it can be done , and here we have proof of it .
however , this directive requires that member states introduce enforcement regimes which are effective , proportionate and dissuasive .
what does that mean ?
therefore , we must be moderate in this area and ensure balance .
that , too , is now something to make us apprehensive .
there are options for bypassing even this system .
around 13 million hectares of forest are deforested every year , as we have already heard today .
i would like to thank the rapporteur .
a decent society creates sensible rules .
the companies should have the documents needed for this in any case .
they need to be genuinely effective in the prevention of malpractice .
it is appropriate to resolve these questions at the corresponding national or regional levels .
the confederal group of the european united left nordic green left will certainly support the rapporteur's proposals .
this is also a human rights issue .
the spokespeople of these companies were turning a blind eye they lacked the courage to be publicly accountable .
similar practices occur in the deforestation sector .
we must eradicate these root and branch .

future of the cap after 2013 debate 
what is the cap for ?
that would help to create jobs and provide real opportunities for farmers to diversify and earn extra income .
that has already been tried and it has failed .
as far as our group is concerned , this report conveys an ambition for european agriculture .
agriculture must be supported in this evolution .
the issue of generational change will be one of our concerns .
let us forget any thoughts of renationalisation .
mr president , please accept my congratulations .
mr president , I would like to thank the rapporteur for this report .
the future of farming and the cap must provide farmers with a viable secure income .
this is impossible without increasing efficiency .
everything else is very worthy , very desirable , but secondary .
solving this problem is going to be difficult .
currently the largest proportion goes to big owners and to producers .
a proper budget for the cap is also important , and I express my thanks to mr lyon .
these systems can operate and become widespread throughout the european union .
the commission must commit itself to defining a budget that is sufficient to achieve these objectives .
a well structured , properly financed common agricultural policy means safe , good quality food for europeans .
it is also important that there is no renationalisation of the cap through cofinancing .
the common agricultural policy must remain a common european policy .
bulgarians and romanians will receive a mere 40 % .
in the 1970s , nearly 70 % of the eu budget was spent on agriculture .
plans for the future of the cap have to work at a practical level and it must be affordable .
what is the aim here ?
what do we mean by that ?
we must return to this topic and we need to go a little further still .
my final point concerns the first and the second pillar .
we are now in the european union .
the rapporteur has produced an excellent report .
any changes that do take place must be accompanied by realistic transition periods .
i would like to thank mr lyon and all of the shadow rapporteurs for their work .
in accepting new challenges , the common agricultural policy must maintain its care for environmental values and food security .
if they are ended , what will we replace them with ?
of course , there are certain ideas , but we do not have any certainty .
furthermore , today we have a cap that must be reformed for three reasons .
eighty per cent of aid is allocated to 20 % of farmers .
yet our farmers are not always rewarded by the market for these contributions to the public good .
i would therefore welcome a clear signal on that from the commissioner as soon as possible .
the president cut off the speaker 
mrs mcguinness has the floor first .
this is a very important issue .
de mr president , I assume you were referring to me .
i would like to pick up on what the previous speaker said .
of course I would like to thank you for your generosity in allowing ten speakers rather than five .
we understand your time constraints , naturally , but I hope you will understand us too .
this is a very important issue .
naturally this is also true beyond the work of the committees .
it would be helpful and fair to put the appropriate structures in place as soon as possible .
we will also be happy to have a solution that is fair to us .
however , I do not wish to prolong the debate .
what we notice is that we are demanding more and more of our farmers .
therefore , in my opinion , historic references do not constitute fair , transparent or objective criteria .
a new strategic importance for food production and the cap absolutely .
two pillars absolutely , I agree with that .
applause 
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place today , thursday 8 july 2010 , at 12.00 .
as mrs mcguinness says , they may present their contribution in writing .
the eu cannot promote free trade while protecting its own agricultural market .
we need incentives for farmers , especially to encourage young people to move to rural areas .
europe will still need an effective and common agricultural policy after 20this is why the eu's agricultural budget should at least be maintained at the current level .
these would reduce farmerslosses arising from price fluctuations .
forward looking targets have been formulated for the entire community .
the tried and tested two pillar structure must be retained with a strong first pillar and an equally strong second pillar .
the future of the common agricultural policy after 2013 is extremely important for us .
today , differences between the level of payments in different member states are too great .
this undermines the sense of solidarity , equality and community .
farmers should take heart that this parliament understands their concerns .
to begin with I want to thank my colleague mr lyon for drafting a very balanced report .
the report is a good basis for further discussions .
in the discussion on the organisation of agrarian reform , there was frequent talk of compensation of public goods .
in my opinion , this debate goes in the right direction .
the development of rural areas plays an ever greater role .
however , this can only be achieved if the resources dedicated to agricultural policy are not reduced after 20i believe that only a major reform can save the common agricultural policy .
the next item is the debate on 
clearly there was not enough time this morning .
you saw the demand and you saw the problem .
the president cut off the speaker 
the administration helps the political bodies organise debates .
i am going to take 30 seconds because I have two blank pages .
i will grant you later the time that you have not used now .
by the same token , ear tagging rules were not enforced .
this decision is motivated by the need to have environmentally friendly agriculture and to combat climate change .
these efforts will be completely undone by this draft bilateral agreement .
we must stop this insane process by offering our citizens quality , locally produced food .
two other points .
i would like to hear some answers to these questions .
the deepening of political and cultural ties and maximising mutual benefits in economic terms therefore makes perfect sense .
agriculture is only one part of this macro agreement .
in economic terms , a successful agreement could bring considerable benefits to both the eu and mercosur .
the first meeting with mercosur took place last week in buenos aires .
it is , however , way too early to discuss what these measures could cover .
as regards food safety , it goes without saying that imports have to fully respect eu food safety requirements .
moreover , brazil often acts as an informal bridge between western and emerging and developing countries .
lastly , tough work is still being finalised on some issues where we expect the summit to deliver .
beef imports will increase by 70 % , poultry imports by 25 % .
commissioner , I would therefore like to voice my concern to you .
our agriculture is in great difficulty .
the commission must hear this message and this demand .
my group and I share these concerns .
disastrous knock on effects might also follow for other sectors , such as the pork sector for example .
this is not scaremongering .
on 5 may of this year , this house supported the reopening of negotiations in the salafranca report .
nonetheless , I would argue that we do not want an agreement at any price .
however , commissioner , this trade with the mercosur countries should not be allowed to become a one way street .
the frequent claims made in public that europe is closing itself off in the agricultural markets are quite wrong .
europe is certainly not closed off to external trade .
in future we should not have to rely on the press for our information .
this is the truth , mr de gucht .
hu the european commission defined the negotiating mandates some 11 years ago .
the european commission has disregarded these developments .
it has not requested a new mandate .
without a proper mandate , we can only reach unacceptable agreements .
contrast that to the delight , or rather to the fear and trepidation and anger , among eu producers .
this parliament imposes high standards of food production on our producers .
in your response you spoke about forthcoming summits on climate change .
recent research has shown that brazilian emissions are between three and eight times higher than the irish equivalent .
the politicians must be able to decide , even when the scientific evidence is unavailable .
how is mercosur qualified , politically speaking , to negotiate with the european union ?
today I took eight speakers .
so I think I have done the maximum I could have done .
first of all on the mandate .
several members criticised the fact that we are working on the basis of a mandate going back to 199this applies to all areas to be covered by the agreement , including agriculture.
that is not the reason to change the mandate .
i am ready to discuss at length any of the elements .
i have done so with the inta committee and I am ready to go back to the inta committee .
on sugar 
the colombian , peruvian and central american aggregated quantities account for less than 2 % of european consumption .
as for plant health , environmental and other measures .
commissioner , I am also sure that this will not be the last time we do so .
the sensitive agricultural sector must not be handed over in the negotiations .
feel free to sell your grandmother , commissioner , but do not give away our european agriculture .
imports of fishery and aquaculture products from third countries account for more than 60 % of eu consumption .
ladies and gentlemen , the survival of european fisheries is non negotiable .
indeed , we are on the eve of an important reform of the cfp .
we need to work together with a global and integrated vision .
consumers want to know more about the seafood they buy .
the commission is ready to work on legislative initiatives aiming at giving consumers the information they need .
finally , a word on aquaculture .
i will be very honest with you on this point .
however , we must be clear .
for these reasons my group will obviously vote in favour of the report .
moreover , I would like to congratulate mr cadec on the excellent work that he has done .
they enter the european market at a price that is uneconomic for european producers .
more than 60 % of all fish consumed in europe today is imported .
this should not need to be the case .
the cadec report mentions several important instruments that the eu can use .
on the one hand , my colleagues want to stop our fishermen receiving any subsidy .
is it your responsibility to prevent this ?
mr gallagher , we have to carry on .
the president cut off the speaker 
that is why I favour a european label , in accordance with our standards , both environmental and social .
people have planes to catch it is inconvenient it makes a mockery of parliament .
someone get a grip !
applause 
i am sure that we will be able to vote at 12.i would like to say that we are taking care of all the concerns mentioned by the members .
i will finish my speech by thanking you in advance for your vote .
after the vote 
thank you very much .
thank you for reminding me .
i will get in touch with them about this .
we have achieved a broad consensus .

we will correct all the translations so that they are in harmony with the original texts .
we have one side that whips the house and only one side that allows a free vote .
mr president , if someone is named in this house , it is their right to reply .
applause 
we will correct the texts and harmonise them with the original .
there is some confusion that you need to sort out and get the votes right and call them right .

corrigendum rule 216 see minutes
pl I endorsed the alvaro report .
on this occasion , though , I believe we have got the balance right .
the united position of the european parliament has taken maximum advantage of the new opportunities the lisbon treaty offers .
i support especially the european parliament's political and financial supervision of the european external action service .
mr president , I voted against this report .
otherwise , I voted in line with my group's position on the matter .
this practice must become the priority of european union foreign policy .
adequate geographical representation must be an unambiguous fundamental principle in the formation of the service .
thank you .
secondly , the eu diplomatic service should reflect the character of the union .
fifthly and finally , let us remember that good diplomacy is built up over many years .
in this way we could ensure that the service operated in a more equitable fashion .
the european union's diplomatic corps has already squeezed out the national services .
i think we could just about manage to do better .
de mr president , I voted against the brok report for four reasons .
the fourth point is the question of how we actually treat each other in parliament .
unfortunately , I did not have any option other than to vote against this text .
that is a crucial point .
we should recognise it .
the macedonian government has democratic legitimacy .
it does first class work and it is putting the country on the path towards european union membership .
aid to kyrgyzstan should be targeted at people and not at a specific government .
the eu has invested billions of euros and the number of people infected is increasing .
has it already been 30 years ?
we must now work together to provide suitable financial resources for these political tasks .
our farmers need a fair wage .
pl I endorsed this report .
this is not inconsistent with free market principles .
in summary , we should aim for the sustainable development of agriculture and rural areas .
secondly , it requires that direct payments to farmers be fully financed from the european union budget .
on a few points I had what I might call national reservations , or I voted a bit differently .
that is why I introduced a few derogations when I voted .
in the united kingdom nurses and teachers face cuts in their pay and pensions .
police numbers are being cut and prisoners are being released because we cannot afford to keep them in prison .
i find that entirely unacceptable .
fi mr president , I voted in favour of the lyon report .
lv thank you .
for this reason , I supported this report , which calls for the current situation to be changed .
today , the terms of this agreement have been considerably improved , in the interest of european citizens .
the agreement is a significant step forward compared to the previous version .
given the highly sensitive nature of the personal data transferred , I could not vote for this agreement .
from that moment on , the issue of reciprocity will become relevant .
under pressure from the european parliament , the agreement which we have already concluded is coming up for review .
this measure will lead to a gross violation of personal privacy .
this is a matter for national governments to decide , and not for the european parliament .
this new agreement is better than the previous one .
i am therefore voting in favour of the measures proposed in this report .
that is why we saidno.
articles 15 and 16 ensure that citizens have strengthened access to redress and increased transparency .
it is unfortunate that the majority in parliament have now voted in favour of this agreement .
we rather support a more secure society with broad democratic rights and freedoms .
in writing . de the fight against terrorism requires international cooperation governed by agreements .
these are serious infringements of fundamental rights .
however , the european union is not permitted to unduly curtail existing fundamental rights .
the new agreement is a victory for all the european institutions , and for our european parliament in particular .
i voted against this report .
it is tantamount to approval of united states interference in europe with the complicity of bodies such as swift .
this report and the agreement that it ratifies are a symbol of this europe's enslavement by american imperialism .
this is a very important agreement which aims to stamp out terrorism and organised crime by combating illegal financing .
this is a commitment which needs to be implemented within five years .
on the other hand , there is the protection of citizensrights .
citizensrights are not a foregone conclusion we have fought for them .
it will be a tool for applying the precedence of community law over the national laws of the states .
it allows the european parliament to reinforce its prerogatives and preserve the community method .
in addition , the latter's budget will be subject to political control from parliament .
the european interest of the initial draft has been retained .
in writing . I welcome the brok report as amended .
it was essential to resist the proposal to subsume development policy as part of our foreign policy .
there remain elements of the proposal that could give rise to different interpretations .
the rules and practice governing languages in this service will reveal the extent of its commitment to external communication .
what has parliament managed to win in the negotiations with the high representative ?
the latter will thus demonstrate genuine political coherence and will speak with one voice on the international stage .
this is a chance for the european union but also for its member states .
timely coordination of the different areas of eu external policy by the commission is clearly important .
the deal is not flawless , however .
in any case , these costs should be within sensible and comprehensible limits .
in this regard , we must utilise synergies in order to achieve maximum quality and cost savings .
it is without hesitation that I support this resolution , which addresses these important issues .
the rampant , widespread corruption and the smuggling of weapons and drugs sow unrest in the region .
the eu basically needs to deal with the process of establishing democracy and reinforcing stability in kosovo .
five eu member states , including france , have not recognised kosovo's independence .
consequently , it is unacceptable to present a report today that advocates the integration of kosovo into the eu .
this is a signal of encouragement for the government as well as the citizens of kosovo .
i hope that albania proceeds along its way towards the union in a determined and unhesitating manner .
it is out of friendship for the albanians that I voted against this text .
we must not let ourselves be deceived .
nevertheless , I do not agree with associating the fight against hiv with a sensitive issue like abortion .
in order to stop the disease , much research is being carried out , also within the eu .
nevertheless , I would reiterate my total commitment to the fight against hiv / aids .
almost half of those living with hiv are women .
school education programmes on sexual and reproductive rights are crucial for hiv / aids prevention .
parliament's support for their prohibition and eradication is fully justified .
the new cap will have to adapt to a changing european and global context and withstand many challenges .
however , a firm policy will need to be backed up by sufficient financial means .
this report gives agricultural policy a strategic role in terms of food security and sustainable development .
this was not included in the report either .
amendment 3 we danish social democrats believe that eu subsidies should be removed from european agricultural policy .
free and fair trade should be the guiding principle for an agricultural area based on sustainability .
this is an issue that concerns europeans , naturally , but also the citizens of the world .
the most important thing is that it acknowledges the injustice done to farmers of the new member states .
it draws attention to food security and the supply of high quality products at a reasonable price .
in truth , we cannot understand what benefit the possible transfer of cap funds to other policies could bring .
i would also advocate market regulation in the dairy sector , from production to marketing .
in addition to food production , agriculture also makes a significant contribution to preserving the cultural landscape .
i also believe that it is essential to consider regionsterritorial features and priorities .
we have rejected any attempts to renationalise the policy .
this text has the merit of recognising market failures and advocating the fight against climate change .
on the contrary it supports productivism and the devastation of local crop farming here and throughout the world .
in truth , we cannot understand what benefit the possible transfer of cap funds to other policies could bring .
i believe that the agricultural sector needs to be considered as strategic within the european union .
i support the structure and approach of the lyon report .
thus , the adoption of this report is highly satisfactory .
it penalises the efficient farmer and props up the inefficient one .
that is what cap reform should be about .
what the consumer cares about is quality and price .
however , a functioning market and a competitive environment would solve this problem in a natural way .
imports of fishery and aquaculture products have increased enormously , but that increase has been necessary .
for that reason , I will be voting in favour of this own initiative report .
imported products must satisfy the same quality criteria as those produced in the eu .
having grown rapidly since 2005 , this market is increasingly dependent on imports .
i fully support the need to change and revitalise the eu's fisheries and aquaculture sector .
it is time to make up for the underestimates and delays of the past .
in addition , greater attention should be paid to food security aspects in order to safeguard consumers .
i agree with the rapporteur on the issue of customs protection .
for these reasons , I voted in favour of this report .
therefore , it is necessary to tighten up legislation on identification .
ultimately , then , we are also dealing with the kimberley process itself .
after all , all diamonds are mined in appalling conditions .
to say that the situation in zimbabwe is tragic is unfortunately an understatement .
it must maintain its positions .
i have to say this is one area where this house speaks with one voice .
here , we must say clearlyyea , yea nay , nay.
the eu delegation is monitoring his situation very closely .
the vote will take place shortly .
he was arrested for providing information on the kimberley process .
venezuela , in particular the case of maria lourdes afiuni
things have not improved since our last resolution quite the opposite .
there is no doubt this measure was taken to humiliate her and to frighten her .
what is the issue at stake here ?
i agree with you on that , but I cannot agree with you on the rest .
author . es madam president , I am of the same opinion as mrs de keyser .
how this judge can hope for a fair trial is beyond me .
this paradox continues to undermine the eu's collective efforts to expose the alarming trend towards totalitarianism in venezuela .
applause 
moreover , does he know that mr chávez poses a danger to democracy and the rule of law ?
judge afiuni's case is a sad reminder of venezuela's negative attitude towards human rights .
venezuela wanted to make civil society participation subject to domestic law .
there is a bad precedent .
finally , I would like to add my voice in calling for the release of the judge .
during my previous speech I referred to journalists .
we are following the tendency of political polarisation re emerging in the country with concern .
the vote will take place shortly .
written statements rule 149 
it highlights the fact that the rule of law is nothing but a meaningless concept in venezuela .
when this does happen , the consequences are drastic .
north korea
well done !
what evidence is there of his crime 20 bibles and 10 worship tapes ?
it is ridiculously difficult to get out of this country , to escape .
let me finish with one thought .
afterwards , the players met with repression , and they were held in forced labour camps .
we are very worried about what is going to happen to these sportsmen next .
reportedly 80 % of north koreans in china end up as trafficking victims .
china must change its law to protect the victims of trafficking instead of returning them to north korea .
finally , we should do our best to assist refugees .
as other colleagues have said , people flee north korea and they are not given the assistance they deserve .
this is something which we should guarantee .
however , there has also been the experience of footballers being made personally responsible for defeats .
i call on the north korean government to explain the whereabouts of the footballers .
occasional news leaks come out from defectors and the reality is truly horrific .
the government of the people's republic of korea denies the existence of the problem of human rights violations .
however , life is better there than in north korea .
according to reports , more than 150 000 north koreans continue to be held in six labour camps .
torture and sentences in forced labour camps , often because of political views , are an everyday occurrence there .
through an active joint approach by the great powers .
although perhaps unwillingly , the west has rather often turned its attention away from events on the korean peninsula .
therefore , we must talk specifically about the crimes which are being committed and renew our appeals .
member of the commission . madam president , I would like to congratulate parliament for undertaking this debate .
