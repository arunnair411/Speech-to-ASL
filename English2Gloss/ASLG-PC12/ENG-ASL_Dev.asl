DIFFERENCE BE THAT THOSE OIL CRISIS BE DESC-GLOBAL WHILE THIS BE DESC-VERY DESC-CLEARLY EU CRISIS .
BUT X-I WOULD LIKE TO STRESS DESC-PARTICULARLY TWO ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESS DESC-IMMEDIATELY
DESC-SO X-I BELIEVE X-IT BE DESC-HIGH TIME GAS FLOW DESC-AGAIN TOWARDS EUROPEAN UNION IN DESC-STABLE CONDITION .

SOME X-WE RECOMMENDATION HAVE BE ADDRESS ALBEIT DESC-BELATEDLY IN COMMISSION X-POSS DESC-SECOND DESC-STRATEGIC ENERGY REVIEW .
THIS WOULD DESC-NOT HAVE DO X-WE ANY DESC-GOOD , AND DESC-INDEED X-IT BE DESC-NOT DO X-WE ANY DESC-GOOD DESC-NOW .
SE THING WILL DESC-NOT HAPPEN DESC-OVERNIGHT , BUT SIGNAL MUST BE SEND OUT .

X-WE KNOW THAT GAS SUPPLIES BE RE NEGOTIATE EVERY YEAR , BECAUSE UKRAINE AND RUSSIUM WORK WITH ONE YEAR CONTRACT .
RUSSIUM AND UKRAINE HAVE DEAL X-MSELVES AND X-Y REPUTATION HEAVY BLOW .
WHAT BE DESC-OBVIOUS BE THAT BOTH COUNTRY HAVE DESC-LITTLE AWARENESS WHEN X-IT COME TO CUSTOMER FRIENDLINESS .
DESC-HOWEVER , GAZPROM HAVE DESC-RECENTLY ISSUE DEMAND FOR DESC-HUGE PRICE INCREASE TO DESC-UNREALISTIC LEVEL .
THIS MEAN THAT UNLIKE PETROLEUM , DESC-RE BE NO DESC-FREE MARKET FOR GAS IN EUROPE .
DESC-HOWEVER , X-WE DO DESC-NOT KNOW FACT SITUATION .
SITUATION BE DESC-ALSO EVIDENCE EUROPEAN UNION X-POSS DEFICIENT ENERGY POLICY .
USE COAL BE OPPOSE UNDER DESC-ENVIRONMENTAL PRETENCE .

THIS BE AREA IN WHICH X-WE BE TO IMPROVE SITUATION .
X-WE NEED TO REVISIT CONDITION FOR ANIMAL DURING TRANSPORT .
DESC-HOWEVER , SE DESC-LONG JOURNEY DESC-ALSO RESULT IN DESC-POORER QUALITY MEAT .
THIS BE DESC-NOT DESC-CURRENTLY BE DO .
MORE AND MORE ANIMAL BE BE TRANSPORT WITHIN EU .

THIS DESC-MODERN REGULATION AT DESC-SAME TIME REDUCE DESC-ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN FOR EUROPEAN PRODUCER EMPLOY MORE THAN 350,000 PEOPLE .
X-I DO DESC-NOT AGREE THAT MESSAGE ABOUT CONTENT NANOMATERIAL IN PRODUCT SHOULD TAKE FORM WARN .
X-I DESC-ALSO DESC-WELCOME FACT THAT DIRECTIVE WILL DESC-ACTUALLY BECOME REGULATION AND WILL HAVE DESC-GREATER DESC-LEGAL EMPHASIS .
WHEREAS DESC-POSITIVE DESC-CHARACTERISTIC NANOMATERIAL BE MORE OR DESC-LESS DESC-FAMILIAR , RISK BE DESC-LARGELY DESC-UNCHARTED .

OPEN SIT
SIT BE DESC-OPEN AT 09.00
PRICE PAY TO MILK PRODUCER HAVE PLUMMET DESC-EVERYWHERE , AVERAGE 24 CENT PER LITRE WITHIN EUROPEAN UNION .
TOP LINE BE DESC-GOOD NEWS PRICE BE IMPROVE .
IF X-I COULD START WITH REPORT , X-I WILL LOOK DESC-FIRST AT STATE AID .
DESC-SECOND POINT BE STREAMLINE PROCEDURE FOR RESPOND TO PRICE IN DAIRY SECTOR .
DAIRY SECTOR BE IN TROUBLE .
COMMISSION DESC-REALLY SHOULD HAVE ACT MORE DESC-SWIFTLY IN THIS REGARD .
X-IT WOULD DESC-ALSO MAKE SENSE TO INTRODUCE DESC-EARLY RETIREMENT REGULATION .
THAT BE WHY X-WE HAVE TABLE AMENDMENT TO THIS EFFECT AND WHY X-I DESC-WELCOME X-YOU REASSURANCE ON THIS MATTER .
CONSUMER BE LOSE OUT AS X-Y FAIL TO GET BENEFIT FROM FALL IN MILK PRICE .
FARMER BE LOSE OUT BECAUSE X-Y DO DESC-NOT RECEIVE DESC-FAIR SHARE RETAIL MILK PRICE .
EUROPEAN UNION HAVE COUNT ON GROWTH IN WORLD DEMAND .
X-ITS EXPERT GET X-IT DESC-VERY DESC-WRONG .
DESC-FINANCIAL AND DESC-ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT X-WE BE EXPERIENCE HAVE DESC-DIRECT EFFECT ON AGRICULTURE AND CONSUMPTION .
ON EACH LITRE MILK , SOME DESC-SMALL FARMER BE LOSE DESC-UP TO 30 CENT .
X-IT HAVE DESC-TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCE IN TERM EMPLOYMENT AND LAND USE PATTERN .
X-Y SIT ON X-Y HAND FOR DESC-TOO DESC-LONG , AND DESC-MANY FARMER HAVE SUFFER DESC-GRIEVOUSLY FOR THAT .
X-I THINK X-WE NEED TO DO MORE IN DESC-SHORT TERM TO HELP INDUSTRY THROUGH THIS DESC-PRESENT CRISIS .
DESC-INSTEAD , X-SHE WANT TO CONTINUE DEREGULATE SECTOR AGAINST FARMERSBEST INTEREST .
X-I CONSIDER X-IT DESC-NECESSARY .
MADAM PRESIDENT , X-I WOULD LIKE TO THANK COMMISSIONER FOR X-SHE WORD TO X-WE TODAY .
WHEN DAIRY SECTOR STRUGGLE , REST DESC-RURAL ECONOMY STRUGGLE .
DESC-CURRENTLY DAIRY FARMER RECEIVE DESC-JUST OVER 20 CENT PER LITRE FOR MILK AMID ESCALATE COST .
MADAM PRESIDENT , WHEN FARM WOMAN START PROTEST X-YOU KNOW DESC-RE BE DESC-SERIOUS DIFFICULTY .
X-I WANT TO SAY THAT , IN RELATION TO FUTURE , X-YOU COMMENT BE DESC-PARTICULARLY DESC-WELCOME .
X-WE MUST ENDORSE X-Y AND DESC-EVEN CALL FOR X-Y TO BE DESC-ENLARGED IN SCOPE .
IN ORDER TO REGULATE MARKET , X-WE NEED PUBLIC REGULATION .
DESC-FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BE REQUIRE BY DAIRY FARMER DESC-IMMEDIATELY .
DESC-CURRENT SITUATION BE DESC-UNSUSTAINABLE AND REQUIRE DESC-POLITICAL SOLUTION .
OPPORTUNITY TO PRODUCE MILK SHOULD GO DESC-MAINLY TO PRODUCER WHO HAVE DESC-LOW COST AND WHO ACHIEVE PROFIT .
MARGIN THAT FARMER RECEIVE BE DESC-SO DESC-UNFAIR .
SUPERMARKET NEED TO REDUCE X-Y PROFIT MARGIN .
QUOTA HAVE INCREASE , WHILE PRODUCTION HAVE FALL .
X-I BELIEVE THAT SET FIX QUOTA WOULD LEAD TO RISE IN PRICE OVER TIME .
BECAUSE DAIRY PRODUCTION DO DESC-NOT HAVE TAP THAT X-WE CAN DESC-JUST TURN OFF AND ON .
BECAUSE DAIRY PRODUCTION DO DESC-NOT HAVE TAP THAT X-WE CAN DESC-JUST TURN OFF AND ON DESC-WILLY DESC-NILLY .
X-WE BE HEAR OVER AND OVER DESC-AGAIN THAT ADOPT MILK QUOTA REGULATION SHOULD BE AMEND .
AS DAIRY FARMER X-MYSELF , X-I CAN DESC-ONLY WARN X-YOU AGAINST DO THIS .
X-I DESC-REFORE CALL ON COMMISSION TO EXPLAIN HOW X-IT BE GO TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM .
DESC-FIRSTLY , IN X-MY VIEW , IMPLEMENTATION DESC-SUPER LEVY AT THIS TIME WOULD BE DESC-INAPPROPRIATE .
THAT BE WHAT X-I TERM DESC-DYSFUNCTIONAL PRICE CHAIN MECHANISM .

DESC-PERHAPS X-YOU SHOULD DO DESC-SO DESC-NOW .
COMMISSIONER , X-YOU SHOULD DESC-NOT PASS BUCK TO MEMBER STATE DESC-SO THAT X-Y HELP WHOEVER X-Y CAN .
CRISIS BE CAUSE BY OVER DESC-ABUNDANT SUPPLY MILK , WHICH BE MAKE PRICE DROP DESC-SHARPLY .
MARKET BE DESC-NOT WORK .
THIS SITUATION BE PLUNGE X-Y INTO DESC-FURR DIFFICULTY , AND X-Y BE DESC-UNABLE TO MEET X-Y OBLIGATION .
CRISIS HAVE DESC-NOT EASE .
X-WE BE DESC-NOT MOUTHPIECE FOR FARMERSINTEREST .
DESC-JUST DESC-NOW , X-YOU LIST MEASURE X-YOU HAVE TAKE IN PAST NINE MONTH .
THOSE MEASURE DO EXIST , X-WE WILL GRANT X-YOU THAT .
E X-WE CAN DESC-NOT ALLOW MILK SECTOR TO COLLAPSE .
X-WE MUST PREVENT SE FALL INTO DESC-NEGATIVE SITUATION .
THIS MUST BE DESC-CORRECT .
THAT BE DESC-VERY DESC-POOR AND DESC-SHORT SIGHT DECISION .
DAIRY PRODUCER DO DESC-NOT NEED X-YOU COMPASSION , COMMISSIONER .
X-Y DO DESC-NOT NEED DESC-OUTMODED DESC-LIBERAL ORY THAT HAVE DRAW X-WE INTO DESC-UNPRECEDENTED WORLD CRISIS .
X-WE BE ALL DESC-DEEPLY SHAKE BY WHAT HAVE HAPPEN .

IN DESC-RECENT WEEK X-WE MEET WITH PRODUCER , X-Y ORGANIZATION AND PROCESSING INDUSTRY .
CASH FLOW IN SECTOR BE DESC-DRY DESC-UP .
IN MARKET THROW OFF BALANCE BY SURPLUS , ANY COUNTRY THAT INCREASE X-ITS PRODUCTION HARM ALL DESC-OR .
WITHOUT THIS , PRICE WILL BECOME DESC-UNPREDICTABLE .
EUROPEAN DAIRY PRODUCER CAN DESC-NOT ENDURE LOSS CAUSE BY DESC-LARGE SCALE PRICE VOLATILITY .
BUT QUOTA DESC-ALONE WILL DESC-NOT SAVE DAIRY SECTOR .

DESC-RE BE TWO TYPE INTERCONNECTION THAT X-WE NEED TO DESC-SEPARATE .
X-WE HAVE SUPPORT INTEGRATION MARKET IN DESC-NORTH AFRICA FOR SOME TIME .
THIS HOUSE HAVE BE DESC-VERY DESC-STRONG SUPPORTER ENERGY EFFICIENCY .
X-IT DESC-REALLY BE DESC-BIGGEST ELEMENT .
X-I BELIEVE THIS BE DESC-VERY DESC-GOOD COMBINATION , AS DESC-RENEWABLE ENERGY DESC-ALSO GIVE SECURITY SUPPLY .
DESC-SO , DIVERSIFICATION DESC-ALSO COVER SUPPLY .
QUESTION SECURITY SUPPLY FOR X-WE CITIZEN BE BECOME DESC-EVER MORE DESC-IMPORTANT .
X-WE BE DESC-DEPENDENT ON DESC-UNSTABLE REGION AND COUNTRY WITH DESC-UNDEMOCRATIC REGIME .
THIS DESC-ALSO APPLY TO EUROPE IN DESC-INTERNATIONAL RELATION .
DESC-NUCLEAR POWER HAVE DESC-MAJOR ROLE TO PLAY BECAUSE X-IT WILL HELP COMBAT GREENHOUSE EFFECT .
DESC-FIRSTLY , COMPLACENCY OVER ENERGY POLICY BE PUT X-WE DESC-INCREASINGLY IN DESC-DANGEROUS POSITION DEPENDENCY ON RUSSIUM .
WHY HAVE X-Y DESC-NOT DESC-UP TO DESC-NOW BE INVOLVE ON DESC-EQUAL FOOTING IN PLANNING AND DECISION MAKE PROCESS ?
PRESIDENT CUT OFF SPEAKER
DESERTEC AND NABUCCO BE DESC-IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT IN THIS REGARD .
THIS BE DESC-ALSO DESC-IMPORTANT TASK FOR X-WE .
THAT BE WHY X-IT BE DESC-IMPORTANT TO FOCUS X-WE EFFORT ON IMPROVE INTERCONNECTION WITHIN EU .
DESC-HOWEVER , SPAIN CAN DESC-NOT HELP WITHOUT IMPROVE X-ITS INTERCONNECTION CAPACITY THROUGH PYRENEE .
THIS BE LINK TO X-MY CALL TO REINFORCE SUPPLY FROM DESC-SOURN EUROPE .
DESERTEC AND NABUCCO BE DESC-CENTRAL TO MEET SE CHALLENGE .
X-WE NEED TO DEVELOP DESC-RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION DESC-SOLAR DESC-RMAL AND DESC-OR .
DESERT GET MORE ENERGY FROM SUN IN SIX HOUR THAN HUMANKIND USE IN YEAR .
DESC-REFORE , X-WE BE IN FAVOR DIVERSIFICATION AND DESC-ALSO SEE NABUCCO PROJECT AS EUROPEAN PRIORITY PROJECT .
TIME WILL TELL WHER NABUCCO WILL PLAY X-ITS PART IN EUROPEAN UNION X-POSS DESC-FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY .
THAT BE WHY X-I BE SURPRISE AT EUROPEAN COMMISSION X-POSS POLICY TOWARDS RUSSIUM WITH REGARD TO THIS MATTER .
COMMISSION BE DESC-GRAVELY MISTAKE IN THINK THAT DESC-SOUTH STREAM BE DESC-NOT RIVAL PROJECT TO NABUCCO .
AMENDMENT TO TREATY BE DESC-LESSER ISSUE .
DE MR PRESIDENT , NABUCCO BE GIUSEPPE VERDUS X-POSS DESC-FIRST DESC-HUGELY DESC-SUCCESSFUL OPERA .
OVER NEXT DESC-FEW YEAR , ELECTRICITY PRODUCE FROM DESC-SOLAR ENERGY WILL BECOME DESC-SIGNIFICANTLY DESC-CHEAPER .
DESC-ENTIRE INVESTMENT COULD BE USE TO GENERATE TOTAL 8 000 MEGAWATT WIND ENERGY .
COMMISSION SHOULD BE IN FAVOR NABUCCO .
IN RELATION TO DESC-MANY SE DESC-RE BE CONNECT DEVELOPMENT ISSUE .
THIS OPPORTUNITY MUST DESC-NOT BE SQUANDER .
DESC-FIRST BE WHAT BE X-WE DESC-ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT WHEN X-WE TALK ABOUT ENERGY SECURITY AND ENERGY ?
IF X-IT BE TO SEND OUT MESSAGE , WITH WHAT DESC-MORAL AUTHORITY BE X-WE DO DESC-SO ?
X-I DESC-JUST FEEL X-WE HAVE ALL MISS DESC-GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE MEDIUM AND DESC-LONG TERM POLICY .
X-WE NEED TO CONCERN X-OURSELVES WITH CONCRETE MATTER AND WORK ON THOSE .
THIS DESC-ALSO RELATE TO QUESTION SOURCE SUPPLY AND TRANSPORT ROUTE .
WHAT BE USE DESC-WONDERFUL PLAN IF DESC-RE BE NO ONE DESC-WILLING TO INVEST IN X-Y ?
COMPANY MUST BE ENCOURAGE .
X-WE MUST GUARD AGAINST BELIEVE THAT X-WE CAN FORCE EVERYTHING TO HAPPEN AND PREDETERMINE EVERY DESC-LAST DETAIL .
X-IT BE DESC-REFORE DESC-EXTREMELY DESC-IMPORTANT FOR X-WE TO TAKE DESC-WISE DECISION IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD ENERGY SUPPLIES .
X-WE DESC-JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT MAP .
DESC-HERE , DESC-TOO , EU MEMBER STATE BE DESC-KEEN TO GET INVOLVE .
NEXT , HOW CAN X-WE GUARANTEE ENERGY SECURITY ?
MR PIEBALG , CONGRATULATION ON ALL THAT X-YOU BE DO .
X-WE MUST DESC-REFORE PREPARE TO IMPORT GAS .
THIS BE DESC-EXCELLENT PROJECT FOR EURO MEDITERRANEAN AREA .
DESC-MUCH DEPEND ON RELATION WITH TURKEY .
X-I BE DESC-PLEASED THAT THIS BE DESC-EXACTLY WHAT COMMISSIONER UNDERLINE TODAY .
X-WE HAVE TO ACHIEVE UNITE EUROPEAN ENERGY POLICY THAT WOULD COORDINATE X-WE ACTIVITY ACROSS ALL ENERGY ISSUE .
THANK X-YOU FOR X-YOU ATTENTION .
X-WE WILL HAVE TO RAISE ESTIMATE FIGURE SOME EUR 8 BILLION FOR 3 300 KILOMETRE PIPELINE .
DESC-ORIGINAL PROMISE BE FOR SOME EUR 30 MILLION .
X-WE NEED TO REALIZE THAT X-WE HAVE TO GO DESC-FURR .
EU MUST INVEST MORE IN DIVERSIFICATION ENERGY SUPPLY SOURCE .
DESC-RE BE DESC-ALSO DESC-CLEAR STRATEGY IN RUSSIUM TO DESC-SECURE X-ITS DOMINANCE IN EUROPE OVER GAS SECTOR .
X-WE MUST ENSURE THAT WORK ON MEDGAZ PIPELINE BE DESC-QUICKLY DESC-COMPLETE .
THIS SITUATION CAN DESC-NOT CONTINUE , BECAUSE IF X-IT DO X-IT WILL DESC-PERMANENTLY JEOPARDISE EUROPEAN UNION X-POSS ENERGY SECURITY .
TURKEY MUST NAIL X-ITS COLOR TO MAST AND PUT X-ITS WEIGHT DESC-FULLY BEHIND NABUCCO PROJECT .
X-WE CAN DESC-ONLY HOPE THAT RUSSIUM WILL RESPECT CHARTER AND WILL DESC-NOT TAKE ANY DESC-DEFINITIVE ACTION .
EUROPEAN GAS CONSUMER CAN DESC-NOT BE LEAVE AT MERCY MONOPOLY .
WHAT SUPPORT MEASURE CAN EUROPEAN COMMISSION TAKE WITH REGARD TO THIS ?
X-WE NEED DESC-BETTER GAS STORAGE CAPACITY IN EUROPE AND MORE INTEGRATION X-WE PIPELINE AND ELECTRICITY GRID .
THIS MEAN THAT DEMAND WILL DESC-NOT BE MEET , DESC-EVEN WITH ALL PROJECT DESC-CURRENTLY IN HAND .
BUT COURSE DESC-RE BE NO ONE ANSWER TO ENSURE X-WE SUPPLY .
ENERGY EFFICIENCY MUST DESC-ALSO BE IMPROVE .
X-IT BE DESC-NOT DESC-QUICK FIX .
X-I WOULD LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING MORE ABOUT THIS .
DESC-HOWEVER , REGULATION ON TRANSPARENCY CAN BE DESC-EASILY CIRCUMVENT .
THIS BE WHY X-WE BE ASK EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO ABANDON X-ITS DESC-CONVENIENT POSITION DESC-IDLE INTROSPECTION .
LET X-WE DESC-NOT MAKE X-OURSELVES DESC-VULNERABLE DESC-PRECISELY ON THIS ISSUE .
X-WE ALL AGREE ON THAT .
IN 2009 , X-HE DESC-PRESENT DESC-INTERESTING REPORT , WHICH CONTAIN DESC-EQUALLY DESC-INTERESTING CONCLUSION .

FOR THIS REASON DESC-SECOND DESC-STRATEGIC ENERGY REVIEW BE DESC-STILL DESC-VERY DESC-IMPORTANT .
ALL POINT THAT X-WE PUT DESC-FORWARD IN DESC-SECOND ENERGY REVIEW BE DESC-STILL DESC-RE .
REGARD POINT ON DESC-NUCLEAR ENERGY , X-WE HAVE MOVE DESC-AWAY FROM THIS OPTION .
