DO COPYRIGHT NEED TO BE ADAPT IN DESC @-@ DIGITAL AGE ?

X @-@ I WOULD LIKE TO CONSIDER ONE DESC @-@ LAST DESC @-@ IMPORTANT POINT AND THAT BE DESC @-@ ONCE DESC @-@ AGAIN SUBJECT COLLECT SOCIETY .
DO X @-@ WE DESC @-@ STILL NEED X @-@ Y ?
X @-@ I BE DESC @-@ INTERESTED TO KNOW WHAT COMMISSION BE PLAN .
THIS ISSUE BE DESC @-@ DEFINITELY DESC @-@ INTENSIVE , DESC @-@ INTERESTING , DESC @-@ EXCITING AND DESC @-@ VERY FUTURE ORIENT .

X @-@ IT BE GOOGLE THAT SCAN MILLION COPYRIGHT TITLE FROM ALL OVER WORLD .
BOTH SE CATEGORY BE DESC @-@ VERY DESC @-@ LOOSELY DEFINE .
X @-@ IT WILL MAKE LITERATURE AND LEARN MORE DESC @-@ ACCESSIBLE TO DESC @-@ DIGITAL GENERATION .
THIS BE DESC @-@ CENTRAL QUESTION AND DESC @-@ MAJOR NECESSITY .
GOOGLE BOOK CAN DESC @-@ NOT DESC @-@ SIMPLY IGNORE ALL ISSUE ON BASIS ASSUMPTION .
ATTEMPT MUST BE MAKE TO FIND AUTHOR AND TO PROTECT X @-@ HE OR X @-@ SHE RIGHTS .
DESC @-@ PERHAPS DESC @-@ STATUTORY EXCEPTION BE NEED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE DESC @-@ RELATIVELY DESC @-@ EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO PROBLEM .

DESC @-@ RE BE DESC @-@ MYRIAD MECHANISM THAT DESC @-@ CURRENTLY ENSURE THAT DESC @-@ MANY SE COUNTRY REMAIN SUBJECT TO DOMINATION AND SUBJUGATION .
LET X @-@ WE PROMOTE SELF SUFFICIENCY .

SCIENCE SAY THAT TWO DEGREE MEAN DESC @-@ RICH COUNTRY MUST REDUCE X @-@ Y CO2 EMISSION BY 40 % .
AND WHAT BE LESSON ?
X @-@ WE NEED OBJECTIVE , DESC @-@ IMPARTIAL DESC @-@ SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH , AND DESC @-@ NOT AGENDA DRIVE DESC @-@ POLITICAL ACTIVISM .

DESC @-@ UNFORTUNATELY , RESULT FROM COPENHAGEN BE DESC @-@ WELL BELOW PAR IN CIRCUMSTANCE .
THAT BE DESC @-@ FIRST DESC @-@ MAIN REASON X @-@ WE BE DESC @-@ EXPRESS X @-@ WE DISAPPOINTMENT .
THIS BE DESC @-@ NOT ROLE X @-@ WE WOULD WISH FOR OR ROLE WHICH BEFIT X @-@ WE .
DESC @-@ SO WHAT NEED TO BE DO ?
EU NEED TO COMMIT X @-@ ITSELF DESC @-@ NOW TO 30 % CUT IN EMISSION FOR THREE REASON .
X @-@ WE CANNOTHALF COMMITTO INVESTMENT IN DESC @-@ RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCE AND DESC @-@ LOW CARBON TRANSPORT .
DESC @-@ SECONDLY , POLITICS WILL GET DESC @-@ BACK TO DESC @-@ GENUINE TOPIC THAT DESC @-@ REALLY CONCERN PEOPLE IN TODAY X @-@ POSS DESC @-@ ECONOMIC RECESSION .

THAT BE TO NO AVAIL WORKER AND EMPLOYEE SHOULD DESC @-@ NOT BE MAKE TO SUFFER .
X @-@ IT ALL GO DESC @-@ WRONG IN COPENHAGEN .
X @-@ IT COULD DESC @-@ ALSO BE CALL DEFEAT .
DESC @-@ SECOND SET QUESTION DESC @-@ ALSO NEED ANSWER .
DESC @-@ OR STATE BE TAKE DESC @-@ DIFFERENT APPROACH , BUT X @-@ IT BE DESC @-@ NOT CASE THAT X @-@ Y BE DO NOTHING .
MR PRESIDENT , X @-@ I DO DESC @-@ NOT WANT TO DEPICT DOOM SCENARIO , AS HAVE BE DO DESC @-@ HERE .
X @-@ WE MUST BE DESC @-@ ABLE TO CONVINCE DESC @-@ OR TO BE AS DESC @-@ AMBITIOUS AS X @-@ WE BE .
DESC @-@ WELL , X @-@ WE DESC @-@ CERTAINLY KNOW X @-@ IT DESC @-@ RE BE NOTHING DESC @-@ RIGHT DESC @-@ NOW .

DESC @-@ FINALLY , AS DESC @-@ MANY X @-@ MY FELLOW MEMBER HAVE DESC @-@ ALREADY SAY , X @-@ WE MUST SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE .
EU AND THIS PARLIAMENT NEED TO EXAMINE DESC @-@ HONESTLY HOW X @-@ IT APPROACH DESC @-@ SUCH MATTER IN FUTURE .

X @-@ I WOULD , DESC @-@ HOWEVER , ASK ALL X @-@ YOU TO KEEP X @-@ YOU SPEECH UNDER ONE MINUTE .
RO IN LINE WITH EXPECTATION , COPENHAGEN SUMMIT DO DESC @-@ NOT END WITH ANY CONCRETE RESULT .
THAT BE WHY EU BE CUT OUT DESC @-@ FINAL NEGOTIATION .
WHY TALK TO NEGOTIATOR WHO CAN DESC @-@ NOT MOVE AT ALL AND HAVE NO FLEXIBILITY ?
DESC @-@ INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE SAY IN 2007 THAT X @-@ Y WOULD DISAPPEAR BY YEAR DESC @-@ 20IT MUST DESC @-@ NOT BE MANUFACTURE AND X @-@ IT MUST DESC @-@ NOT BE INVENT .
X @-@ I DO DESC @-@ NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY SE ISSUE SHOULD MAKE X @-@ WE DESC @-@ LOWER X @-@ WE GUARD .

THIS BE DESC @-@ QUITE DESC @-@ IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN X @-@ MY VIEW .
DESC @-@ REFORE , THIS DOSSIER DESC @-@ ALSO HAVE DESC @-@ ECONOMIC ASPECT .
X @-@ WE BE DESC @-@ NOW TALK ABOUT AROUND 30 % COST .
DESC @-@ REFORE , SE THREE POINT BE DESC @-@ CRUCIAL FOR X @-@ I .
AIRPORT SECURITY BE RESPONSIBILITY MEMBER STATE .
DIRECTIVE ON AVIATION SECURITY CHARGE AND DIRECTIVE ON AIRPORT CHARGE SHOULD BE HARMONISE .
SE SECURITY MEASURE SHOULD DESC @-@ NOT , ALL DESC @-@ SAME , IMPEDE DESC @-@ SMOOTH FLOW PASSENGER TRAFFIC AT AIRPORT .
DESC @-@ REGRETTABLY , THIS PROCEDURE DO DESC @-@ NOT INCLUDE OPTION RECEIVE ITEM DESC @-@ LATER AT ADDRESSEE X @-@ POSS ADDRESS .
COMMISSIONER , IF X @-@ WE WANT TO HELP EUROPE BECOME DESC @-@ COMPETITIVE , X @-@ WE MUST FORGET ABOUT SET DESC @-@ UP DESC @-@ NEW AUTHORITY .
WHAT BE DESC @-@ CLEAR BE THAT ASH CLOUD HAVE DESC @-@ ONLY DELAY PILOTSSTRIKE WHICH HAVE BE ANNOUNCE .
X @-@ I WOULD LIKE TO DESC @-@ QUICKLY RAISE ANOR POINT .
THIS BE TASK AIRPORT AND AIRLINE WHICH MUST BECOME MORE DESC @-@ OPEN AND DESC @-@ TRANSPARENT .
X @-@ I TAKE DESC @-@ POSITIVE VIEW SUBSIDIARITY IN REPORT , AND X @-@ IT SHOULD DESC @-@ DEFINITELY BE RETAIN .
WHOEVER ORDER GOVERNMENT RELATE SECURITY MEASURE DESC @-@ ALSO PAY FOR X @-@ Y .
COST FOR DESC @-@ EXTRA SECURITY SHOULD , IN END , BE COVER BY MEMBER STATE .
X @-@ ITS OBLIGATION GO BEYOND THAT , BECAUSE STATE BE DESC @-@ NOT DESC @-@ SIMPLY ANOR SERVICE PROVIDER MOTIVATE DESC @-@ EXCLUSIVELY BY PROFIT .
X @-@ I THINK THAT DESC @-@ EXCESSIVE , BUT DESC @-@ NEVERLESS BELIEVE THAT X @-@ WE HAVE PROVIDE IMPROVEMENT THROUGHOUT SYSTEM .
MADAM PRESIDENT , X @-@ I BE DESC @-@ SOMEWHAT EMBARRASS AFTER DESC @-@ SO DESC @-@ MUCH PRAISE , AND DESC @-@ SO X @-@ I WILL KEEP X @-@ IT DESC @-@ SHORT .
THIS BE WHY X @-@ I BE APPEAL TO COUNCIL AND MEMBER STATE TO MOVE ON THIS .

X @-@ IT DO DESC @-@ NOT FIT INTO EUROPEAN LANDSCAPE .
THAT BE X @-@ HE RESPONSIBILITY .
X @-@ WE MUST GET DESC @-@ RID THIS TRANSRAPID SYSTEM .
X @-@ IT BE DESC @-@ NICE MODEL FROM DESC @-@ SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE , BUT X @-@ IT HAVE NO PLACE IN EUROPE .
X @-@ WE WILL MANAGE , DESC @-@ NEVERLESS .
X @-@ WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT ADD VALUE FOR EUROPEAN UNION AND EUROPEAN TAXPAYER .
DE MADAM PRESIDENT , TRAN EUROPEAN NETWORK BE DESC @-@ INDEED UTILISE FOR DESC @-@ REGULAR TRAFFIC IN EUROPE .
THAT BE WHAT X @-@ IT BE ALL ABOUT , AND THAT BE DESC @-@ ALSO WHAT X @-@ WE WILL DEBATE DESC @-@ ACCORDINGLY .
THIS MAKE SHIP DESC @-@ CRUCIAL DESC @-@ ECONOMIC SECTOR AND ONE THAT HAVE TO COMPETE IN DESC @-@ GLOBAL MARKET .
X @-@ WE KNOW THAT DESC @-@ MANY COUNTRY WORLD OVER SUPPORT X @-@ Y MARITIME FLEET IN DESC @-@ VERY DESC @-@ DIVERSE WAY .
FOR X @-@ I , THAT BE MISNOMER AND X @-@ I WOULD HAVE PREFER SOMETHING LIKESUBSTANDARDSHIP .

THIS MEAN DESC @-@ EFFICIENT , DESC @-@ SAFE , DESC @-@ SECURE AND DESC @-@ ENVIRONMENTALLY DESC @-@ FRIENDLY MARITIME TRANSPORT SERVICE .
MARITIME TRANSPORT PROVIDE FOR DESC @-@ HIGH QUALITY JOB IN EUROPE AND FUEL RESEARCH AND EUROPEAN DESC @-@ INDUSTRIAL INNOVATION .
IN THIS CONTEXT , EMPHASIS MUST LIE ON MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT DESC @-@ INTERNATIONAL ORDER .
X @-@ WE BE FACE WITH THREAT LIKE PROTECTIONISM , DESC @-@ UNFAIR COMPETITION , SUBSTANDARD SHIPPING OR PIRACY .
X @-@ I WOULD DESC @-@ ALSO LIKE TO ANSWER POINT ON STATE AID GUIDELINE FOR SHIPPING IN DESC @-@ 20OF COURSE , EUROPEAN SHIPPING FACE DESC @-@ HUGE CHALLENGE AT DESC @-@ PRESENT , AS DESC @-@ WELL AS DESC @-@ EXOGENOUS CHALLENGE .

DESC @-@ YET WHERE BE DEBATE ON DESC @-@ RESPONSIBLE , DESC @-@ ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND SCRAP SHIP ?
EUROPE BE DESC @-@ MAJOR COMPETITOR ON MARITIME TRANSPORT MARKET , DESC @-@ ESPECIALLY IN TERM TRANSPORT PASSENGER AND CONTAINER .
EUROPEAN UNION X @-@ POSS POSITION IN DESC @-@ GLOBAL MARKET IN THIS SECTOR MUST BE ENHANCE .
AT DESC @-@ SAME TIME , X @-@ WE MUST DESC @-@ ALSO PLAY ON LEVEL PLAY FIELD .
THAT HAVE BECOME DESC @-@ ABUNDANTLY DESC @-@ CLEAR .
NINETY PER CENT X @-@ WE EXPORT AND IMPORT BE TRANSPORT VIA PORT .
X @-@ WE NEED DESC @-@ NEW BLOOD .
X @-@ IT HAVE BE MENTION THAT MARITIME TRANSPORT BE VEHICLE FOR 80 % WORLD X @-@ POSS TRADE .
DESC @-@ FIRST BE PIRACY , ON WHICH RECOMMENDATION BE ALL DESC @-@ GOOD , BUT DESC @-@ INEVITABLY DESC @-@ GENERAL .

DESC @-@ ONCE DESC @-@ AGAIN , X @-@ I CAN HEAR GOVERNMENT SAY THAT X @-@ WE CAN DESC @-@ NOT INVESTIGATE X @-@ Y STATISTICS OR X @-@ Y DESC @-@ BUDGETARY PROCEDURE .

EUROPEAN RESOURCE NEED TO BE USE DESC @-@ EFFICIENTLY .
DESC @-@ OBVIOUSLY , EARTHQUAKE CAUSE DISASTER IN HAITUS .
SE MEASURE HAVE TWO DESC @-@ BASIC STAGE , AND X @-@ WE BE TALK ABOUT SE TWO STAGE TODAY .
DESC @-@ THIRD STAGE BE SOMETHING DESC @-@ ONLY FOR X @-@ WE .
DESC @-@ NOT DESC @-@ EVEN EXPERIENCE DESC @-@ SEVERAL RESCUE GROUP BE DESC @-@ SUFFICIENT .
X @-@ I DESC @-@ ALSO URGE X @-@ YOU DESC @-@ NOT TO FORGET FUTURE COMMITMENT THAT X @-@ WE NEED TO MAKE .

X @-@ I WOULD LIKE TO START WITH DESC @-@ BIGGER POLICY ISSUE , ON EU IMPROVE X @-@ ITS RESPONSE CAPABILITY .
X @-@ I CAN ASSURE X @-@ YOU THAT THIS BE DESC @-@ VERY DESC @-@ HIGH PRIORITY FOR X @-@ WE TEAM .
IN HAITUS , DESC @-@ ECOLOGICALLY DESTROY ISLAND , COURSE X @-@ IT HAVE IMPLICATION FOR SCALE THIS DESTRUCTION .
X @-@ WE BE THINK IN DESC @-@ LONG TERM WHEN X @-@ WE THINK CHILE .
X @-@ WE BE WORK ON DESC @-@ SAME BASIS AND ON DESC @-@ WELL DESC @-@ PREPARED GROUND .
X @-@ WE BE WORK ON PROPERTY RIGHTS .
X @-@ WE HAVE LAND CADASTRE AND X @-@ WE WILL WORK ON X @-@ IT , BUT DESC @-@ RE COULD BE RISK .
RISK COULD DESC @-@ DEFINITELY COME FROM OWNERSHIP DESC @-@ POLITICAL PROCESS .
X @-@ Y BE GUARANTEE THAT , IF PROCESS BE DESC @-@ WELL ORGANISE , X @-@ IT WILL BE DESC @-@ SUCCESSFUL .
SIT BE SUSPEND AT 13.10 AND RESUME AT 15.05
X @-@ IT BE DESC @-@ NOW TIME FOR X @-@ WE TO CARRY OUT INTERIM REVIEW AID EFFORT IN HAITUS .
HOW BE DESC @-@ ENTIRE AID EFFORT COORDINATE ?
PURPOSE OFFICE DESC @-@ HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BE TO STRENGN EU X @-@ POSS ROLE AS DESC @-@ GLOBAL PLAYER .
SOME MEMBER STATE LAUNCH INDIVIDUAL AID CAMPAIGN AND DESC @-@ OR ACT DESC @-@ JOINTLY .
DESC @-@ HIGH REPRESENTATIVE SHOULD DESC @-@ NOW AT DESC @-@ LAST BE REALIZE WHAT X @-@ SHE JOB BE ALL ABOUT .
DESC @-@ MEANWHILE , DESC @-@ INTERNATIONAL COMMENTATOR BE CRITICISE X @-@ WE DESC @-@ UNCOORDINATED ACTION .
SE BE DESC @-@ VERY DESC @-@ OPTIMISTIC SUM .
WHAT BE X @-@ YOU VIEW ON THIS APPROACH ?
GIVE ESTIMATE TOTAL EUR 8.4 BILLION , THAT MAKE PROFIT EUR 620 MILLION .
X @-@ IT BE DESC @-@ NOT .
TREATY DO DESC @-@ NOT SAY THAT X @-@ IT BE FORBID TO TAKE ON DEBT .
X @-@ I REPEAT TREATY DESC @-@ CLEARLY STATE THAT MEMBER STATE CAN DESC @-@ NOT BE FORCE TO TAKE ON DEBT .
X @-@ I BE DESC @-@ HERE TO REPLY ON BEHALF COMMISSION .
LET X @-@ WE DESC @-@ ALSO BE DESC @-@ CLEAR FROM POINT VIEW COMMISSION .
DESC @-@ NATURALLY , X @-@ WE HAVE BE DESC @-@ VERY DESC @-@ CAUTIOUS ON THAT POINT .
X @-@ IT BE PARLIAMENT X @-@ POSS INSISTENCE ON SCRAP DESC @-@ NATIONAL OPT OUT FROM DIRECTIVE WHICH LEAD TO STALEMATE .
DESC @-@ RECENTLY , X @-@ WE HAVE SPEAK DESC @-@ GREAT DEAL ABOUT CRISIS AND HOW TO OVERCOME X @-@ IT .
DO X @-@ YOU THINK THAT X @-@ WE AND COMMISSION HAVE DO DESC @-@ ENOUGH ?
X @-@ I THINK COMMISSION PROPOSAL BE DESC @-@ RIGHT ONE .
DESC @-@ FINANCIAL SECTOR NEED THIS KIND CREDIBILITY TO FINANCE ECONOMY .
THAT BE X @-@ MY QUESTION .
X @-@ I APOLOGISE FOR THAT WORD .
DESC @-@ FURRMORE , COURSE , DESC @-@ HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BE EX OFFICIO VICE PRESIDENT COMMISSION .
X @-@ I DO DESC @-@ NOT AGREE .
BUT DESC @-@ RE BE DESC @-@ OR COMMUNITY COMPETENCE THAT SHOULD DESC @-@ NOT GO DESC @-@ NOW TO DESC @-@ INTERGOVERNMENTAL ARM .
X @-@ IT SHOULD BE KEEP , COURSE , IN COMMUNITY METHOD .
DESC @-@ SO DESC @-@ HIGH REPRESENTATIVE VICE PRESIDENT COMMISSION BE , AS X @-@ WE SAY , DESC @-@ USUALLY DESC @-@ DOUBLE HAT .
BABY GROW PRODUCE BY X @-@ WE COST EUR 4 5 , WHEREAS ONE FROM CHINA COST EUR X @-@ I KNOW THAT PROTECTIONIST MEASURE BE DESC @-@ UNDESIRABLE , BUT WHAT BE ANSWER ?
THAT WILL BE SELF DEFEAT FOR X @-@ WE .
THAT BE WHY X @-@ IT BE DESC @-@ SO DESC @-@ MUCH DESC @-@ DEPENDENT ON CORRECTION SOME DESC @-@ FISCAL IMBALANCE .
IN 2009 , 2.7 MILLION PEOPLE IN EURO AREA LOSE X @-@ Y JOB .
ALL ISSUE X @-@ YOU HAVE RAISE BE DEAL WITH IN 2020 STRATEGY , MR DAERDEN .
X @-@ WE BE DESC @-@ ALSO START TO SEE MORE DESC @-@ CONSISTENT SIGN STABILISATION IN SOME MEMBER STATE .
X @-@ WE HAVE MORE THAN 20 % DESC @-@ YOUNG PEOPLE DESC @-@ UNEMPLOYED IN EUROPE .
TWO X @-@ Y X @-@ I HAVE DESC @-@ ALREADY MENTION .
WILL COMMISSION EMBRACE THIS ROADMAP ?
X @-@ I DO EVERYTHING TO BE DESC @-@ PRESENT AT X @-@ HE DESC @-@ FUNERAL .
FOR THIS BE DESC @-@ BEST WAY TO ENCOURAGE SELF EMPLOYMENT , AND RATE SELF EMPLOYMENT BE DESC @-@ STILL DESC @-@ TOO DESC @-@ LOW TODAY .
DESC @-@ HENCE , IN THIS CONTEXT , SE QUESTION WOULD APPEAR TO BE DESC @-@ JUSTIFIED .
THIS BE DESC @-@ JUST ONE DESC @-@ MANY EXAMPLE JOB BE LOSE IN EUROPE .
X @-@ YOU WORK PROGRAM DO DESC @-@ NOT PROVIDE DESC @-@ VERY DESC @-@ DEFINITIVE INFORMATION IN THIS RESPECT .
THAT BE DESC @-@ ONLY WAY TO DO X @-@ IT .
FUS MR PRESIDENT , COMMISSIONER , UNEMPLOYMENT AND EXCLUSION AMONG DESC @-@ YOUNG PEOPLE BE DESC @-@ BIG PROBLEM .
THIS WOULD DESC @-@ REFORE REQUIRE DESC @-@ LARGE AMOUNT LABOR MIGRATION .
IN X @-@ MY OPINION , DESC @-@ RE BE SOMETHING CONTRADICTION DESC @-@ HERE .
X @-@ I WANT TO WIN THIS COMPETITIVENESS BATTLE DESC @-@ GLOBALLY .
DESC @-@ RE BE NO CONTRADICTION BETWEEN HAVE DESC @-@ LONGER WORK LIFE AND HAVE SOME IMMIGRATION TO EUROPE .
THIS SHOW THAT DESC @-@ RE BE PROBLEM MISMATCH BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR LABOR .
IN FACT , X @-@ IT HAVE BE DESC @-@ POSSIBLE TO KEEP PEOPLE IN WORK FOR DESC @-@ LONGER .
THAT BE DESC @-@ NOT DESC @-@ TRUE .
WHY DO THIS DESC @-@ NOT FORM PART EUROPE 2020 ?
GROWTH , DESC @-@ NOT DESC @-@ ONLY DESC @-@ SMART GROWTH AND DESC @-@ EQUITABLE GROWTH , BUT DESC @-@ ALSO DESC @-@ SUSTAINABLE GROWTH .
DESC @-@ RE BE SOME MEMBER STATE WHERE EMPLOYMENT RATE FOR WOMAN BE DESC @-@ STILL DESC @-@ VERY DESC @-@ MUCH DESC @-@ LOWER THAN FOR MAN .

X @-@ WE HAVE TO ADDRESS DESC @-@ GLOBALLY SOME IMBALANCE THAT BE AT ORIGIN THIS CRISIS .
X @-@ IT BE DESC @-@ IMPORTANT THAT EUROPE DESC @-@ PRESENT COORDINATE APPROACH TO GANOR OBJECTIVE WILL BE DRIVE ON WITH DESC @-@ FINANCIAL MARKET REFORM .

THIS CAN BE ACHIEVE BY DESC @-@ HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION AND TRAINING , OPERATE THROUGH COORDINATION AT MEMBER STATE LEVEL .
CONVINCING EUROPEAN STRATEGY TO CREATE DESC @-@ STRONGER EUROPE SHOULD TAKE LEADERSHIP ON DESC @-@ GLOBAL LEVEL .

IF THAT TURN OUT TO BE ELECTROMOBILITY , X @-@ WE SHALL NEED EUROPEAN AND DESC @-@ INTERNATIONAL STANDARDISATION .
IN X @-@ MY OPINION , THIS BE HOW X @-@ WE SHOULD APPROACH ISSUE STANDARDISE DESC @-@ ELECTRIC VEHICLE .
PRESSURE FOR INNOVATION SHOULD COME DESC @-@ NOT FROM REGULATION BUT FROM DEMAND .
