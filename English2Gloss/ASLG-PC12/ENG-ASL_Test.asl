DIFFERENCE BE THAT THOSE OIL CRISIS BE DESC-GLOBAL WHILE THIS BE DESC-VERY DESC-CLEARLY EU CRISIS .
BUT X-I WOULD LIKE TO STRESS DESC-PARTICULARLY TWO ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESS DESC-IMMEDIATELY
DESC-SO X-I BELIEVE X-IT BE DESC-HIGH TIME GAS FLOW DESC-AGAIN TOWARDS EUROPEAN UNION IN DESC-STABLE CONDITION .

SOME X-WE RECOMMENDATION HAVE BE ADDRESS ALBEIT DESC-BELATEDLY IN COMMISSION X-POSS DESC-SECOND DESC-STRATEGIC ENERGY REVIEW .
THIS WOULD DESC-NOT HAVE DO X-WE ANY DESC-GOOD , AND DESC-INDEED X-IT BE DESC-NOT DO X-WE ANY DESC-GOOD DESC-NOW .
SE THING WILL DESC-NOT HAPPEN DESC-OVERNIGHT , BUT SIGNAL MUST BE SEND OUT .

X-WE KNOW THAT GAS SUPPLIES BE RE NEGOTIATE EVERY YEAR , BECAUSE UKRAINE AND RUSSIUM WORK WITH ONE YEAR CONTRACT .
RUSSIUM AND UKRAINE HAVE DEAL X-MSELVES AND X-Y REPUTATION HEAVY BLOW .
WHAT BE DESC-OBVIOUS BE THAT BOTH COUNTRY HAVE DESC-LITTLE AWARENESS WHEN X-IT COME TO CUSTOMER FRIENDLINESS .
DESC-HOWEVER , GAZPROM HAVE DESC-RECENTLY ISSUE DEMAND FOR DESC-HUGE PRICE INCREASE TO DESC-UNREALISTIC LEVEL .
THIS MEAN THAT UNLIKE PETROLEUM , DESC-RE BE NO DESC-FREE MARKET FOR GAS IN EUROPE .
DESC-HOWEVER , X-WE DO DESC-NOT KNOW FACT SITUATION .
SITUATION BE DESC-ALSO EVIDENCE EUROPEAN UNION X-POSS DEFICIENT ENERGY POLICY .
USE COAL BE OPPOSE UNDER DESC-ENVIRONMENTAL PRETENCE .

THIS BE AREA IN WHICH X-WE BE TO IMPROVE SITUATION .
X-WE NEED TO REVISIT CONDITION FOR ANIMAL DURING TRANSPORT .
DESC-HOWEVER , SE DESC-LONG JOURNEY DESC-ALSO RESULT IN DESC-POORER QUALITY MEAT .
THIS BE DESC-NOT DESC-CURRENTLY BE DO .
MORE AND MORE ANIMAL BE BE TRANSPORT WITHIN EU .

THIS DESC-MODERN REGULATION AT DESC-SAME TIME REDUCE DESC-ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN FOR EUROPEAN PRODUCER EMPLOY MORE THAN 350,000 PEOPLE .
X-I DO DESC-NOT AGREE THAT MESSAGE ABOUT CONTENT NANOMATERIAL IN PRODUCT SHOULD TAKE FORM WARN .
X-I DESC-ALSO DESC-WELCOME FACT THAT DIRECTIVE WILL DESC-ACTUALLY BECOME REGULATION AND WILL HAVE DESC-GREATER DESC-LEGAL EMPHASIS .
WHEREAS DESC-POSITIVE DESC-CHARACTERISTIC NANOMATERIAL BE MORE OR DESC-LESS DESC-FAMILIAR , RISK BE DESC-LARGELY DESC-UNCHARTED .

OPEN SIT
SIT BE DESC-OPEN AT 09.00
PRICE PAY TO MILK PRODUCER HAVE PLUMMET DESC-EVERYWHERE , AVERAGE 24 CENT PER LITRE WITHIN EUROPEAN UNION .
TOP LINE BE DESC-GOOD NEWS PRICE BE IMPROVE .
IF X-I COULD START WITH REPORT , X-I WILL LOOK DESC-FIRST AT STATE AID .
DESC-SECOND POINT BE STREAMLINE PROCEDURE FOR RESPOND TO PRICE IN DAIRY SECTOR .
DAIRY SECTOR BE IN TROUBLE .
COMMISSION DESC-REALLY SHOULD HAVE ACT MORE DESC-SWIFTLY IN THIS REGARD .
X-IT WOULD DESC-ALSO MAKE SENSE TO INTRODUCE DESC-EARLY RETIREMENT REGULATION .
THAT BE WHY X-WE HAVE TABLE AMENDMENT TO THIS EFFECT AND WHY X-I DESC-WELCOME X-YOU REASSURANCE ON THIS MATTER .
CONSUMER BE LOSE OUT AS X-Y FAIL TO GET BENEFIT FROM FALL IN MILK PRICE .
FARMER BE LOSE OUT BECAUSE X-Y DO DESC-NOT RECEIVE DESC-FAIR SHARE RETAIL MILK PRICE .
EUROPEAN UNION HAVE COUNT ON GROWTH IN WORLD DEMAND .
X-ITS EXPERT GET X-IT DESC-VERY DESC-WRONG .
DESC-FINANCIAL AND DESC-ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT X-WE BE EXPERIENCE HAVE DESC-DIRECT EFFECT ON AGRICULTURE AND CONSUMPTION .
ON EACH LITRE MILK , SOME DESC-SMALL FARMER BE LOSE DESC-UP TO 30 CENT .
X-IT HAVE DESC-TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCE IN TERM EMPLOYMENT AND LAND USE PATTERN .
X-Y SIT ON X-Y HAND FOR DESC-TOO DESC-LONG , AND DESC-MANY FARMER HAVE SUFFER DESC-GRIEVOUSLY FOR THAT .
X-I THINK X-WE NEED TO DO MORE IN DESC-SHORT TERM TO HELP INDUSTRY THROUGH THIS DESC-PRESENT CRISIS .
DESC-INSTEAD , X-SHE WANT TO CONTINUE DEREGULATE SECTOR AGAINST FARMERSBEST INTEREST .
X-I CONSIDER X-IT DESC-NECESSARY .
MADAM PRESIDENT , X-I WOULD LIKE TO THANK COMMISSIONER FOR X-SHE WORD TO X-WE TODAY .
WHEN DAIRY SECTOR STRUGGLE , REST DESC-RURAL ECONOMY STRUGGLE .
DESC-CURRENTLY DAIRY FARMER RECEIVE DESC-JUST OVER 20 CENT PER LITRE FOR MILK AMID ESCALATE COST .
MADAM PRESIDENT , WHEN FARM WOMAN START PROTEST X-YOU KNOW DESC-RE BE DESC-SERIOUS DIFFICULTY .
X-I WANT TO SAY THAT , IN RELATION TO FUTURE , X-YOU COMMENT BE DESC-PARTICULARLY DESC-WELCOME .
X-WE MUST ENDORSE X-Y AND DESC-EVEN CALL FOR X-Y TO BE DESC-ENLARGED IN SCOPE .
IN ORDER TO REGULATE MARKET , X-WE NEED PUBLIC REGULATION .
DESC-FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BE REQUIRE BY DAIRY FARMER DESC-IMMEDIATELY .
DESC-CURRENT SITUATION BE DESC-UNSUSTAINABLE AND REQUIRE DESC-POLITICAL SOLUTION .
OPPORTUNITY TO PRODUCE MILK SHOULD GO DESC-MAINLY TO PRODUCER WHO HAVE DESC-LOW COST AND WHO ACHIEVE PROFIT .
MARGIN THAT FARMER RECEIVE BE DESC-SO DESC-UNFAIR .
SUPERMARKET NEED TO REDUCE X-Y PROFIT MARGIN .
QUOTA HAVE INCREASE , WHILE PRODUCTION HAVE FALL .
X-I BELIEVE THAT SET FIX QUOTA WOULD LEAD TO RISE IN PRICE OVER TIME .
BECAUSE DAIRY PRODUCTION DO DESC-NOT HAVE TAP THAT X-WE CAN DESC-JUST TURN OFF AND ON .
BECAUSE DAIRY PRODUCTION DO DESC-NOT HAVE TAP THAT X-WE CAN DESC-JUST TURN OFF AND ON DESC-WILLY DESC-NILLY .
X-WE BE HEAR OVER AND OVER DESC-AGAIN THAT ADOPT MILK QUOTA REGULATION SHOULD BE AMEND .
AS DAIRY FARMER X-MYSELF , X-I CAN DESC-ONLY WARN X-YOU AGAINST DO THIS .
X-I DESC-REFORE CALL ON COMMISSION TO EXPLAIN HOW X-IT BE GO TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM .
DESC-FIRSTLY , IN X-MY VIEW , IMPLEMENTATION DESC-SUPER LEVY AT THIS TIME WOULD BE DESC-INAPPROPRIATE .
THAT BE WHAT X-I TERM DESC-DYSFUNCTIONAL PRICE CHAIN MECHANISM .

DESC-PERHAPS X-YOU SHOULD DO DESC-SO DESC-NOW .
COMMISSIONER , X-YOU SHOULD DESC-NOT PASS BUCK TO MEMBER STATE DESC-SO THAT X-Y HELP WHOEVER X-Y CAN .
CRISIS BE CAUSE BY OVER DESC-ABUNDANT SUPPLY MILK , WHICH BE MAKE PRICE DROP DESC-SHARPLY .
MARKET BE DESC-NOT WORK .
THIS SITUATION BE PLUNGE X-Y INTO DESC-FURR DIFFICULTY , AND X-Y BE DESC-UNABLE TO MEET X-Y OBLIGATION .
CRISIS HAVE DESC-NOT EASE .
X-WE BE DESC-NOT MOUTHPIECE FOR FARMERSINTEREST .
DESC-JUST DESC-NOW , X-YOU LIST MEASURE X-YOU HAVE TAKE IN PAST NINE MONTH .
THOSE MEASURE DO EXIST , X-WE WILL GRANT X-YOU THAT .
E X-WE CAN DESC-NOT ALLOW MILK SECTOR TO COLLAPSE .
X-WE MUST PREVENT SE FALL INTO DESC-NEGATIVE SITUATION .
THIS MUST BE DESC-CORRECT .
THAT BE DESC-VERY DESC-POOR AND DESC-SHORT SIGHT DECISION .
DAIRY PRODUCER DO DESC-NOT NEED X-YOU COMPASSION , COMMISSIONER .
X-Y DO DESC-NOT NEED DESC-OUTMODED DESC-LIBERAL ORY THAT HAVE DRAW X-WE INTO DESC-UNPRECEDENTED WORLD CRISIS .
X-WE BE ALL DESC-DEEPLY SHAKE BY WHAT HAVE HAPPEN .

IN DESC-RECENT WEEK X-WE MEET WITH PRODUCER , X-Y ORGANIZATION AND PROCESSING INDUSTRY .
CASH FLOW IN SECTOR BE DESC-DRY DESC-UP .
IN MARKET THROW OFF BALANCE BY SURPLUS , ANY COUNTRY THAT INCREASE X-ITS PRODUCTION HARM ALL DESC-OR .
WITHOUT THIS , PRICE WILL BECOME DESC-UNPREDICTABLE .
EUROPEAN DAIRY PRODUCER CAN DESC-NOT ENDURE LOSS CAUSE BY DESC-LARGE SCALE PRICE VOLATILITY .
BUT QUOTA DESC-ALONE WILL DESC-NOT SAVE DAIRY SECTOR .

DESC-RE BE TWO TYPE INTERCONNECTION THAT X-WE NEED TO DESC-SEPARATE .
X-WE HAVE SUPPORT INTEGRATION MARKET IN DESC-NORTH AFRICA FOR SOME TIME .
THIS HOUSE HAVE BE DESC-VERY DESC-STRONG SUPPORTER ENERGY EFFICIENCY .
X-IT DESC-REALLY BE DESC-BIGGEST ELEMENT .
X-I BELIEVE THIS BE DESC-VERY DESC-GOOD COMBINATION , AS DESC-RENEWABLE ENERGY DESC-ALSO GIVE SECURITY SUPPLY .
DESC-SO , DIVERSIFICATION DESC-ALSO COVER SUPPLY .
QUESTION SECURITY SUPPLY FOR X-WE CITIZEN BE BECOME DESC-EVER MORE DESC-IMPORTANT .
X-WE BE DESC-DEPENDENT ON DESC-UNSTABLE REGION AND COUNTRY WITH DESC-UNDEMOCRATIC REGIME .
THIS DESC-ALSO APPLY TO EUROPE IN DESC-INTERNATIONAL RELATION .
DESC-NUCLEAR POWER HAVE DESC-MAJOR ROLE TO PLAY BECAUSE X-IT WILL HELP COMBAT GREENHOUSE EFFECT .
DESC-FIRSTLY , COMPLACENCY OVER ENERGY POLICY BE PUT X-WE DESC-INCREASINGLY IN DESC-DANGEROUS POSITION DEPENDENCY ON RUSSIUM .
WHY HAVE X-Y DESC-NOT DESC-UP TO DESC-NOW BE INVOLVE ON DESC-EQUAL FOOTING IN PLANNING AND DECISION MAKE PROCESS ?
PRESIDENT CUT OFF SPEAKER
DESERTEC AND NABUCCO BE DESC-IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT IN THIS REGARD .
THIS BE DESC-ALSO DESC-IMPORTANT TASK FOR X-WE .
THAT BE WHY X-IT BE DESC-IMPORTANT TO FOCUS X-WE EFFORT ON IMPROVE INTERCONNECTION WITHIN EU .
DESC-HOWEVER , SPAIN CAN DESC-NOT HELP WITHOUT IMPROVE X-ITS INTERCONNECTION CAPACITY THROUGH PYRENEE .
THIS BE LINK TO X-MY CALL TO REINFORCE SUPPLY FROM DESC-SOURN EUROPE .
DESERTEC AND NABUCCO BE DESC-CENTRAL TO MEET SE CHALLENGE .
X-WE NEED TO DEVELOP DESC-RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION DESC-SOLAR DESC-RMAL AND DESC-OR .
DESERT GET MORE ENERGY FROM SUN IN SIX HOUR THAN HUMANKIND USE IN YEAR .
DESC-REFORE , X-WE BE IN FAVOR DIVERSIFICATION AND DESC-ALSO SEE NABUCCO PROJECT AS EUROPEAN PRIORITY PROJECT .
TIME WILL TELL WHER NABUCCO WILL PLAY X-ITS PART IN EUROPEAN UNION X-POSS DESC-FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY .
THAT BE WHY X-I BE SURPRISE AT EUROPEAN COMMISSION X-POSS POLICY TOWARDS RUSSIUM WITH REGARD TO THIS MATTER .
COMMISSION BE DESC-GRAVELY MISTAKE IN THINK THAT DESC-SOUTH STREAM BE DESC-NOT RIVAL PROJECT TO NABUCCO .
AMENDMENT TO TREATY BE DESC-LESSER ISSUE .
DE MR PRESIDENT , NABUCCO BE GIUSEPPE VERDUS X-POSS DESC-FIRST DESC-HUGELY DESC-SUCCESSFUL OPERA .
OVER NEXT DESC-FEW YEAR , ELECTRICITY PRODUCE FROM DESC-SOLAR ENERGY WILL BECOME DESC-SIGNIFICANTLY DESC-CHEAPER .
DESC-ENTIRE INVESTMENT COULD BE USE TO GENERATE TOTAL 8 000 MEGAWATT WIND ENERGY .
COMMISSION SHOULD BE IN FAVOR NABUCCO .
IN RELATION TO DESC-MANY SE DESC-RE BE CONNECT DEVELOPMENT ISSUE .
THIS OPPORTUNITY MUST DESC-NOT BE SQUANDER .
DESC-FIRST BE WHAT BE X-WE DESC-ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT WHEN X-WE TALK ABOUT ENERGY SECURITY AND ENERGY ?
IF X-IT BE TO SEND OUT MESSAGE , WITH WHAT DESC-MORAL AUTHORITY BE X-WE DO DESC-SO ?
X-I DESC-JUST FEEL X-WE HAVE ALL MISS DESC-GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE MEDIUM AND DESC-LONG TERM POLICY .
X-WE NEED TO CONCERN X-OURSELVES WITH CONCRETE MATTER AND WORK ON THOSE .
THIS DESC-ALSO RELATE TO QUESTION SOURCE SUPPLY AND TRANSPORT ROUTE .
WHAT BE USE DESC-WONDERFUL PLAN IF DESC-RE BE NO ONE DESC-WILLING TO INVEST IN X-Y ?
COMPANY MUST BE ENCOURAGE .
X-WE MUST GUARD AGAINST BELIEVE THAT X-WE CAN FORCE EVERYTHING TO HAPPEN AND PREDETERMINE EVERY DESC-LAST DETAIL .
X-IT BE DESC-REFORE DESC-EXTREMELY DESC-IMPORTANT FOR X-WE TO TAKE DESC-WISE DECISION IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD ENERGY SUPPLIES .
X-WE DESC-JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT MAP .
DESC-HERE , DESC-TOO , EU MEMBER STATE BE DESC-KEEN TO GET INVOLVE .
NEXT , HOW CAN X-WE GUARANTEE ENERGY SECURITY ?
MR PIEBALG , CONGRATULATION ON ALL THAT X-YOU BE DO .
X-WE MUST DESC-REFORE PREPARE TO IMPORT GAS .
THIS BE DESC-EXCELLENT PROJECT FOR EURO MEDITERRANEAN AREA .
DESC-MUCH DEPEND ON RELATION WITH TURKEY .
X-I BE DESC-PLEASED THAT THIS BE DESC-EXACTLY WHAT COMMISSIONER UNDERLINE TODAY .
X-WE HAVE TO ACHIEVE UNITE EUROPEAN ENERGY POLICY THAT WOULD COORDINATE X-WE ACTIVITY ACROSS ALL ENERGY ISSUE .
THANK X-YOU FOR X-YOU ATTENTION .
X-WE WILL HAVE TO RAISE ESTIMATE FIGURE SOME EUR 8 BILLION FOR 3 300 KILOMETRE PIPELINE .
DESC-ORIGINAL PROMISE BE FOR SOME EUR 30 MILLION .
X-WE NEED TO REALIZE THAT X-WE HAVE TO GO DESC-FURR .
EU MUST INVEST MORE IN DIVERSIFICATION ENERGY SUPPLY SOURCE .
DESC-RE BE DESC-ALSO DESC-CLEAR STRATEGY IN RUSSIUM TO DESC-SECURE X-ITS DOMINANCE IN EUROPE OVER GAS SECTOR .
X-WE MUST ENSURE THAT WORK ON MEDGAZ PIPELINE BE DESC-QUICKLY DESC-COMPLETE .
THIS SITUATION CAN DESC-NOT CONTINUE , BECAUSE IF X-IT DO X-IT WILL DESC-PERMANENTLY JEOPARDISE EUROPEAN UNION X-POSS ENERGY SECURITY .
TURKEY MUST NAIL X-ITS COLOR TO MAST AND PUT X-ITS WEIGHT DESC-FULLY BEHIND NABUCCO PROJECT .
X-WE CAN DESC-ONLY HOPE THAT RUSSIUM WILL RESPECT CHARTER AND WILL DESC-NOT TAKE ANY DESC-DEFINITIVE ACTION .
EUROPEAN GAS CONSUMER CAN DESC-NOT BE LEAVE AT MERCY MONOPOLY .
WHAT SUPPORT MEASURE CAN EUROPEAN COMMISSION TAKE WITH REGARD TO THIS ?
X-WE NEED DESC-BETTER GAS STORAGE CAPACITY IN EUROPE AND MORE INTEGRATION X-WE PIPELINE AND ELECTRICITY GRID .
THIS MEAN THAT DEMAND WILL DESC-NOT BE MEET , DESC-EVEN WITH ALL PROJECT DESC-CURRENTLY IN HAND .
BUT COURSE DESC-RE BE NO ONE ANSWER TO ENSURE X-WE SUPPLY .
ENERGY EFFICIENCY MUST DESC-ALSO BE IMPROVE .
X-IT BE DESC-NOT DESC-QUICK FIX .
X-I WOULD LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING MORE ABOUT THIS .
DESC-HOWEVER , REGULATION ON TRANSPARENCY CAN BE DESC-EASILY CIRCUMVENT .
THIS BE WHY X-WE BE ASK EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO ABANDON X-ITS DESC-CONVENIENT POSITION DESC-IDLE INTROSPECTION .
LET X-WE DESC-NOT MAKE X-OURSELVES DESC-VULNERABLE DESC-PRECISELY ON THIS ISSUE .
X-WE ALL AGREE ON THAT .
IN 2009 , X-HE DESC-PRESENT DESC-INTERESTING REPORT , WHICH CONTAIN DESC-EQUALLY DESC-INTERESTING CONCLUSION .

FOR THIS REASON DESC-SECOND DESC-STRATEGIC ENERGY REVIEW BE DESC-STILL DESC-VERY DESC-IMPORTANT .
ALL POINT THAT X-WE PUT DESC-FORWARD IN DESC-SECOND ENERGY REVIEW BE DESC-STILL DESC-RE .
REGARD POINT ON DESC-NUCLEAR ENERGY , X-WE HAVE MOVE DESC-AWAY FROM THIS OPTION .

X-IT BE COMMUNITY METHOD THAT PRESIDENT COUNCIL MUST DEFEND .
CLIMATE PROTECTION AND DESC-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BE DESC-ACTUALLY TWO SIDE DESC-SAME COIN .
MR PRESIDENT , TREATY LISBON HAVE BE RATIFY BY ALL 27 MEMBER STATE .
CLAV HAVEL X-POSS SPEECH . VIEW X-WE DESC-CELEBRATORY SIT TODAY AND V ?
X-WE HAVE DO THIS DESC-UP TO DESC-NOW , AND X-WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO DESC-SO .
DESC-SO SOMEBODY SHOULD TELL DESC-TONY BLAIR DESC-NOT TO GET DESC-TOO UPSET IF X-HE DO DESC-NOT GET X-IT !
MEMBER DESC-HERE HAVE CELEBRATE DESC-20TH ANNIVERSARY FALL BERLIN WALL AND DESC-RIGHTLY DESC-SO .
BUT DESC-NOW X-WE HAVE DESC-NEW BERLIN WALL , DESC-NOT ON FRONTIER NATION BUT WITHIN NATION .

GERMANY AND AUSTRIUM BE DESC-POOR EXAMPLE IN THIS REGARD , BUT DESC-SO , DESC-UNFORTUNATELY , BE DESC-OR .
DESC-RE BE QUALIFY PEOPLE SIT IN THIS CHAMBER , BUT X-Y HAVE NO CHANCE BE ACCEPT .
X-IT BE DESC-MUCH DESC-LENGTHIER PROCESS THAN ANYONE COULD FORESEE .
TO SAY DESC-OBVIOUS , X-IT BE DESC-NOT THAT X-WE BE DESC-NOT TRY TO FIND DESC-BEST DESC-POSSIBLE BALANCE .
THAT BE WHAT X-WE HAVE BE TRY TO DO .
FR WITH REGARD TO DESC-INSTITUTIONAL QUESTION , LET X-WE BE DESC-TOTALLY DESC-HONEST WITH X-OURSELVES .
MOST X-WE HAVE FIGHT DESC-HARD TO HAVE THIS TREATY , OVER DESC-MANY YEAR , AT DESC-LEAST NINE YEAR !
IF X-WE DO DESC-NOT HAVE INSTITUTION THAT WORK , WHAT WILL HAPPEN ?
WHY MUST PRESIDENT COUNCIL BE DESC-PRIME MINISTER ?
IN X-MY VIEW , THIS BE ANTICLIMAX .
WOULD X-IT HAVE BE DESC-POSSIBLE TO DECIDE THAT EU WOULD DESC-NOT MAKE DESC-REASONABLE CONTRIBUTION ?
X-HE POSITION BE DESC-BADLY DESIGN FROM DESC-DEMOCRATIC POINT VIEW .
ISSUE NOMINATION BE DESC-VERY DESC-IMPORTANT .
DESC-WELCOME
THAT MUST BE CASE FOR PRESIDENT EUROPEAN COUNCIL , DESC-TOO .
DESC-ONLY PRESIDENT COMMISSION HAVE DESC-FULL LEGITIMACY .
DESC-EVEN MOST DESC-PERFECT TREATY COULD DESC-NOT , BY X-ITSELF , SOLVE DESC-MANY PROBLEM .
WITHOUT DESC-FREE AND VIGILANT MEDIA , PUBLIC WOULD BE DESC-COMPLETELY DESC-UNAWARE CHOICE EU LEADER .
ALL DESC-SAME , X-WE TRY TO GUIDE DESC-OR OUTSIDE EU ON IMPORTANCE DESC-DEMOCRATIC ELECTION .
DESC-YET X-MY SCEPTICISM ABOUT THIS PROJECT BE DESC-UNDIMINISHED .
X-MY FELLOW MEMBER CAN DESC-NOT FAIL TO SHARE X-MY OPINION .
UNLIKE X-Y , X-I BE DESC-PLEASED THAT DESC-EXTERNAL SERVICE BE TO REMAIN OUTSIDE COMMISSION .
BESIDES , HERMAN VAN ROMPUY DO DESC-NOT DESC-ACTUALLY GOVERN AS DESC-PRIME MINISTER .
ANY FORM OPT OUT WEAKEN COMMUNITY .
X-WE NEED PRESIDENT COUNCIL WHO BE DESC-CAPABLE GUARANTEE CONSISTENCY AND CONTINUITY .
DESC-SECOND CHALLENGE BE THAT DESC-GREEN GROWTH .
COMPANY BE FIND X-IT DESC-DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN DESC-FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND BANK LOAN , WHILE UNEMPLOYMENT BE ON RISE .
THIS BE DESC-ALSO MENTION IN THIS DOCUMENT .
METHOD X-WE HAVE FOR COORDINATE DESC-SOCIAL POLICY , BASE ON DESC-OPEN APPROACH , BE DESC-FAIRLY DESC-INEFFECTIVE .
X-IT BE X-WE SHARE RESPONSIBILITY TO HIGHLIGHT THIS FACT .
DESC-PRECISELY DESC-SAME THING HAPPEN WHEN X-WE NEGOTIATE CLIMATE TARGET .
X-IT BE DESC-EXACTLY DESC-SAME WITH CLIMATE PACKAGE .
DESC-HOWEVER , TWO DEGREE TARGET BE DESC-EXTREMELY DESC-IMPORTANT AND DESC-REFORE X-WE MUST DESC-NOW PUSH DESC-FORWARD WITH DESC-FULL COMMITMENT .
X-IT MUST TAKE DESC-REAL INITIATIVE IN COPENHAGEN .
EUROPE NEED LOUDER VOICE THAT BE MORE UNITE AND DESC-STRONGER .
DER PUTIN DEAL FROM DESC-EVER BE REPEAT .
CLAV HAVEL TELL X-WE TODAY THAT EUROPE BE HOMELAND X-WE HOMELAND .
BASE UPON THIS UNDERSTANDING , X-I THINK X-WE CAN SUCCEED IN IMPLEMENTATION LISBON TREATY .
E FREIBERGA BE DESC-STAUNCH EUROPEAN CITIZEN .
X-SHE BE DESC-HIGHLY EDUCATE AND DESC-POWERFUL FIGURE WHO DESC-THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND CHALLENGE EUROPE X-POSS FUTURE .
DESC-LASTLY , ON DESC-STRONG INSTITUTION , MR BARROSO BE DESC-ABSOLUTELY DESC-RIGHT .
CONDITION OUGHT TO RELATE , IN DESC-PARTICULAR , TO DESC-MANDATORY DESC-LEGAL NATURE FUTURE AGREEMENT .
X-WE CAN DESC-NOT ALLOW UNION TO BE REPRESENT DESC-CONTINUALLY DESC-ONLY BY FACE MAN .
DESC-HOWEVER , X-WE MUST DESC-ALSO ASK WHAT PRICE X-WE HAVE PAY TO ACHIEVE THIS .
PRICE X-WE HAVE PAY BE DESC-ACTUALLY THAT X-WE HAVE UNDERMINE X-WE VALUE AND LET PRAGMATISM TRIUMPH OVER VALUE .
X-YOU KNOW WHAT X-I BE REFER TO DESC-HERE .
IN X-MY VIEW , WHAT EUROPEAN UNION DO BE DESC-UNACCEPTABLE FROM DESC-LEGAL , DESC-POLITICAL AND DESC-MORAL PERSPECTIVE .
EUROPEAN UNION WILL ATTEND COPENHAGEN CONFERENCE AS LEADER IN BATTLE AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE .
WHER X-WE LIKE X-IT OR DESC-NOT , DESC-UNSOLVED PROBLEM AFFECT SE DESC-INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY BE DESC-PRESENT WITHIN EUROPEAN UNION .
PL MADAM PRESIDENT , ADOPTION DESC-LONG AWAIT LISBON TREATY BE DESC-NOW BEHIND X-WE .
MOST DESC-IMPORTANT TASK TODAY FOR EU AND X-ITS MEMBER STATE BE TO RESOLVE DESC-ECONOMIC AND DESC-SOCIAL PROBLEM .
X-I THINK X-WE SHOULD DESC-ALSO LOOK AT TITLE .
DESC-WELL DO ON WHAT X-YOU HAVE DO DESC-SO DESC-FAR .
FALL WALL MARK START DESC-REAL EUROPE .
THAT WOULD , COURSE , REQUIRE CONSENT ALL 27 COUNTRY .
X-IT BE DESC-TOO DESC-PREMATURE TO SPECULATE ABOUT NAME DESC-YET .
BUT DESC-RE BE , AS DESC-PRIME MINISTER SAY , DESC-ONLY TWO POST TO BE CREATE .
SWEDISH PRESIDENCY , COMMISSION AND DESC-MANY DESC-OR WORK DAY AND NIGHT .
X-I DEPLORE X-IT , BUT X-IT BE FACT .
X-WE HAVE CONFIRM COMMISSION X-POSS ESTIMATE AND BE DESC-BACK X-Y .
DESC-RE WILL BE DESC-GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION KEY BASE ON EMISSION AND ABILITY TO PAY .
THAT BE HOW SE THING LINK IN , DESC-JUST AS MR BARNIER SAY DESC-EARLIER .
DEBATE BE DESC-CLOSE .
DESC-EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRY BE IN DESC-LATTER SITUATION .
DESC-CONSEQUENTLY , ANY DISCONTINUATION THIS DESC-FINANCIAL SUPPORT WILL DISRUPT ANTI CRISIS PROGRAM WHICH ROMANIUM HAVE LAUNCH .
COPENHAGEN OR NO COPENHAGEN , CLIMATE CHANGE WILL BE WITH X-WE FOR DECADE TO COME .
DESC-EQUALLY , X-WE NEED TO CHOOSE TOP LEADER AS DESC-SOON AS DESC-POSSIBLE , AND DESC-NOT TO WASTE TIME .
THIS BE WHY EUROPEAN INSTITUTION MUST PROMOTE DESC-NEW DESC-DYNAMIC LABOR MARKET POLICY AS DESC-SOON AS DESC-POSSIBLE .
DESC-HOWEVER , THISFOOTNOTEWILL DESC-NOT ENTER INTO FORCE UNTIL ICELAND OR CROATIUM RATIFY TREATY .
AT TIME , EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT DO DESC-NOT ALLOW COMMISSION TO BE COMPROMISE IN THIS WAY .
X-I TRUST PARLIAMENT WILL DESC-NOT HAVE TO INTERVENE DESC-AGAIN .
X-IT BE TIME FOR WOMAN !
X-IT BE DESC-GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR EU TO EVALUATE RELATION BETWEEN X-OURSELVES AND RUSSIUM .
X-WE HAVE LOT TO GAIN FROM COOPERATION WITH RUSSIUM IN ALL AREA .
X-WE WILL DESC-ALSO DESC-EXPRESS X-WE DISAPPOINTMENT OVER RUSSIUM X-POSS DESC-RECENT WITHDRAWAL FROM ENERGY CHARTER TREATY .
X-WE HOPE THAT DESC-STRONGER DESC-EARLY WARN MECHANISM WILL BE ESTABLISH AND APPROVE AT SUMMIT .
X-WE MUST DESC-ALSO REGAIN DESC-NECESSARY TRUST WITH REGARD TO AKHALGORUS , DESC-UPPER KODORUS AND CHECKPOINT IN PEREVUS .
SUMMIT WILL DESC-ALSO ALLOW X-WE TO RAISE NUMBER DESC-INTERNATIONAL AND DESC-REGIONAL ISSUE .
X-IT BE DESC-CRUCIAL , DESC-TOO , THAT RUSSIUM DO DESC-NOT SUCCUMB TO TEMPTATION PROTECTIONISM .
DESC-CLEARLY , X-WE BELIEVE THAT DESC-BEST WAY DESC-FORWARD BE TO WORK DESC-TOGER IN RULE BASE DESC-MULTILATERAL FORMAT .
SUMMIT WILL BE OPPORTUNITY TO DESC-AGAIN STRESS IMPORTANCE RUSSIUM X-POSS WTO ACCESSION .
SE SHOULD DESC-REFORE FORM BASIS X-WE WORK ON ENERGY SECURITY UNDER DESC-NEW EU RUSSIUM AGREEMENT .
X-WE HOPE THAT CONDITION WILL DESC-SOON BE IN PLACE FOR VISA DESC-FREE TRAVEL BETWEEN EU AND RUSSIUM .
IN CAUCASUS , X-WE MUST DESC-JOINTLY DEMAND DESC-UNRESTRICTED ACCESS FOR EU OBSERVER .
X-WE MUST LOOK DESC-TOGER WITH RUSSIUM TO DESC-NEW DESC-GLOBAL SECURITY ARRANGEMENT OR AGREEMENT .
X-I THINK THAT MEDVEDEV INITIATIVE SHOULD DESC-NOT BE DESC-IMMEDIATELY REJECT .
DESC-OR THINK THAT DESC-RE BE NO AGENDA AND X-IT BE DESC-MERE TEST X-WE REACTION .
X-WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT BE DESC-STILL DESC-VALID AND X-WE HAVE TO ADD SOMETHING DESC-NEW TO X-Y .
THIS INCLUDE INVOLVEMENT RUSSIUM IN DESC-INTERNATIONAL DESC-REGULATORY FRAMEWORK LIKE WTO AND ENERGY CHARTER .
IF RUSSIAN DELEGATION HAVE DESC-SIMILAR RECOMMENDATION , SUMMIT BE DOOM TO FAILURE .
X-IT BE RUSSIUM , DESC-NONELESS , THAT RESCUE KYOTO PROTOCOL , WHILE X-WE REFUSE TO RATIFY X-IT .
SITUATION BE DESC-DEFINITELY DESC-NOT IDEAL .

PROOF THIS BE FACT THAT DECISION BY COMMISSION HAVE DESC-ALWAYS BE TAKE BY CONSENSUS .
IN X-MY VIEW , FOCUS ON IMMIGRATION IN THAT WAY BE DESC-NOT DESC-ONLY DESC-WRONG BUT DESC-ALSO DESC-DANGEROUS .
ISSUE RELATE TO IMMIGRATION HAVE SECURITY ASPECT .
FRONTEX TAKE CARE THIS .
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE , LIKE DESC-OR PEOPLE , HAVE DESC-RIGHT TO DESC-DIGNIFIED EXISTENCE THAT FULFIL X-Y ASPIRATION .
WHEN X-IT COME TO COMBATE CROSS BORDER CRIME , CHALLENGE BE DESC-GREAT .
X-WE NEED DESC-COMMON SOLUTION TO DESC-COMMON PROBLEM .
X-Y MAY SEEM LIKE DESC-VERY DESC-TECHNICAL ISSUE , BUT X-Y BE DESC-VERY DESC-IMPORTANT FOR INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN .

X-IT BE DESC-THUS DESC-INEVITABLE THAT DESC-RE WOULD BE SE PROBLEM LINK TO PACE WORK .
DOCUMENT UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THIS PARLIAMENT CAN DESC-NOT BE EXPLAIN IN DESC-FEW SECONDS THAT REMAIN TO X-I .
ONE EXAMPLE BE IMMIGRATION POLICY .
ANDREW SYMEOU , 20 YEAR DESC-OLD LONDON MAN , BE EXTRADITE TO GREECE THIS SUMMER ON MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE .
X-HE DESC-NOW LANGUISH IN GREEK PRISON AWAIT TRIAL .
EVIDENCE AGAINST X-HE WOULD DESC-NOT STAND DESC-UP FOR FIVE MINUTE IF EXAMINE BY BRITISH COURT .
IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE BE DESC-CONTRADICTORY .
BRITISH COURT CAN DESC-NOT DESC-NOW PROTECT BRITISH CITIZEN FROM DESC-UNJUST ARREST AND IMPRISONMENT BY DESC-FOREIGN COURT .
X-WE WILL SUCCEED BY MEANS STOCKHOLM PROGRAM , WHICH BE FIVE YEAR WORK PROGRAM .
PARLIAMENT X-POSS RESOLUTION DEFINE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT X-POSS DESC-POLITICAL PRIORITY IN THIS AREA .
X-WE CAN DESC-NOT ACCEPT DESC-LIBERAL GROUP X-POSS PRESUMPTION TO DESC-RIGHT TO MONOPOLISE PRINCIPLE NON DISCRIMINATION .

DESC-NOW X-WE CAN MAKE DIFFERENCE AND THAT BE DESC-EXACTLY WHAT X-WE SHOULD DO .
X-IT BE WHEN X-WE NEED COOPERATION THAT X-WE MUST USE EUROPEAN INSTITUTION .
X-I THINK THAT THIS TYPE ARGUMENT BE DESC-COMPLETELY DESC-IRRELEVANT .
DESC-GLOBAL APPROACH TO MIGRATION SHOULD BE ONE DESC-IMPORTANT START POINT IN THIS CONNECTION .

X-WE MUST RETAIN BENEFIT THIS .

EQUALITY BETWEEN WOMAN AND MAN IN EUROPEAN UNION 2009 DEBATE
X-I BELIEVE DESC-REFORE THAT MAN MUST DESC-ALSO MAKE COMMITMENT TO COMBAT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMAN .
59.1 % WOMAN WORK TODAY .
DESC-OBVIOUSLY , X-I BELIEVE THAT X-WE HAVE TO COMBAT DESC-SEXIST STEREOTYPE .
DESC-SEXUAL AND DESC-REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS BE DESC-IMPORTANT CHAPTER BECAUSE WOMAN MUST HAVE CONTROL OVER X-Y DESC-SEXUAL AND DESC-REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS .
LET X-WE TURN TO PATERNITY LEAVE .
BY WAY ILLUSTRATION , X-I WILL MENTION THREE SE .
DESC-CURRENT EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT , FOR EXAMPLE , HAVE X-ITS DESC-HIGHEST DESC-EVER PERCENTAGE WOMAN 35 % .
DESC-THIRD DESC-NOTABLE INITIATIVE BE INTRODUCTION EUROPEAN INSTITUTE FOR GENDER EQUALITY .
NO .
DESC-LATTER EXIST TODAY TO PREVENT PREGNANCY AT DESC-VERY DESC-EARLY AGE .
DESC-FIRST ALL , X-MY COMPLIMENT TO RAPPORTEUR .
LET X-WE DESC-JUST CONCENTRATE ON SPECIFIC MEASURE .
X-IT BE BRIMFUL PLAN THAT X-WE WANT CARRY OUT .
X-WE HOPE THAT COMMISSION WILL TAKE ACTION DESC-ACCORDINGLY .
NO FAITH AT ALL BE NEED , TODAY , TO SEE PERSON IN UNBORN DESC-HUMAN FOETUS .

PIDLUM , HAVE RECOGNIZE THAT X-WE NEED DESC-NEW DESC-LEGAL ACTION .

X-IT BE MISTAKE TO BELIEVE THAT CHARTER WILL SOLVE WOMAN X-POSS PROBLEM .
NO ONE CAN SAY THAT DESC-LEGAL INSTRUMENT IGNORE WOMAN X-POSS RIGHTS .
THAT WOULD BE DESC-INTELLECTUALLY DESC-DISHONEST AND DESC-FACTUALLY DESC-INCORRECT .
X-WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DESC-DEFINITE PROGRESS HAVE BE MAKE WITH REGARD TO EQUALITY .
X-I WANT TO EMPHASISE THREE DESC-PARTICULAR POINT .

WOMAN IN BUSINESS , WOMAN AT WORK THAT BE WHAT X-WE CLAMOR FOR .
DESC-REFORE , ECONOMY SHOULD BE WORK TO SUPPORT FAMILY AND WOMAN .
DESC-FIRST AND DESC-FOREMOST , DESC-HOWEVER , X-WE NEED TO DESC-EFFECTIVELY PUT ALL EQUALITY LAW INTO PRACTICE .
DE MADAM PRESIDENT , X-WE HAVE EUROPEAN YEAR AGAINST POVERTY AND EXCLUSION .
WOMAN BE DESC-STILL AT DESC-VERY DESC-HIGH RISK BECOME DESC-POOR OR HAVE TO DESC-LIVE IN POVERTY .

THIS BE DESC-NOT DESC-STATISTICAL MATTER .
EUROSTAT RECEIVE NOTIFICATION FROM MEMBER STATE .

X-I HAVE TELL COUNCIL THAT X-WE BE GO TO ASK X-IT FOR THOSE POWER DESC-AGAIN .
X-IT BE DESC-SPECIAL COUNCIL MEETING BECAUSE DESC-RE BE DESC-NOT DESC-MANY MATTER ON TABLE .
THIS SYSTEM SHOULD FUNCTION DESC-ALMOST IN DESC-REAL TIME .
SIT BE SUSPEND FOR DESC-FEW MINUTE
DESC-OR GIVE BACKGROUND SUPPORT .
DESC-BEST RESPONSE TO DESC-TERRORIST BE DESC-CRIMINAL CONVICTION .
X-IT MUST SERVE AS EXAMPLE .
E MADAM PRESIDENT , X-I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASISE POINT RAISE DESC-RECENTLY BY MR FLAUTRE .
LADY AND GENTLEMAN COUNCIL AND COMMISSION , THIS DESC-HISTORICAL RESPONSIBILITY CAN DESC-NOT BE ALLOW UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE .
PL MADAM PRESIDENT , X-I WOULD LIKE TO START WITH WHAT DESC-PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAY DESC-HERE .
EUROPEAN UNION AND UNITE STATE HAVE WORK DESC-VERY DESC-THOROUGHLY ON THIS ISSUE .
X-I THINK THAT THIS BE DESC-VERY DESC-CLEAR WHEN X-WE LOOK AT MEASURE THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAVE ADOPT .
X-HE HAVE PUT END TO ENHANCEDINTERROGATION TECHNIQUE , DESC-ALSO BY CIUM .
DEBATE BE DESC-CLOSE .
THIS MEAN THAT DESC-RE WILL DESC-ONLY BE RESTRICTION AND PROHIBITION ON DESC-INTERNATIONAL FISHING FLEET , DESC-NOT DESC-LOCAL FISHING .
X-IT BE DESC-REFORE DESC-DIFFICULT AT THIS TIME TO GIVE DESC-DETAILED ANSWER ON SE ISSUE .
EUROPEAN UNION BE ONE DESC-MAJOR MARKET FOR WILDLIFE PRODUCT .
DESC-FIRST BE ATLANTIC BLUEFIN TUNA .
X-I HAVE TO REPEAT DESC-HERE THAT DESC-RE BE NO DESC-FINAL POSITION ON THIS ISSUE .
X-WE DESC-ALSO BELIEVE THAT X-IT BE WORTH CHECK HOW ANY DESC-ADDITIONAL THREAT TO THIS SPECIES MIGHT BE MITIGATE .
BLUEFIN TUNA BE IN DESC-IMMEDIATE DANGER EXTINCTION .
DESC-SO DESC-SCIENTIFIC PART DEBATE HAVE BE RESOLVE .
X-WE HAVE COMMISSIONER AND MINISTER DESC-JUST GO THROUGH MOTION .
SPECIES HAVE DROP BY 80 TO 90 % .
X-WE BE FACE EXTINCTION AND X-YOU HAVE BODY WHICH BE SET DESC-UP DESC-SUPPOSEDLY TO LOOK AFTER TUNA !
TARGET WHICH X-IT HAVE SET X-ITSELF WILL FAIL DESC-COMPLETELY .
X-IT IGNORE DESC-SCIENTIFIC ADVICE X-IT KEEP SET QUOTA DESC-FAR , DESC-FAR DESC-TOO DESC-HIGH .
DESC-HOWEVER , X-WE MUST CONCEDE THAT ATTEMPT BE BE MAKE TO WEAKEN THAT RESOLUTION BEHIND SCENE .
THIS BE DESC-CRUCIAL FOR SURVIVAL THIS SPECIES .
X-WE BE TALK ABOUT FISHING QUOTA , CONSERVATION , MAINTAIN HABITAT , AND DESC-SO ON AND DESC-SO DESC-FORTH .
X-IT DESC-ALSO EXPLAIN DESC-ENORMOUS DESC-ILLEGAL CATCH WHICH BE ESTIMATE TO BE DESC-TWICE SIZE SET QUOTA .
DESC-ONLY SALVATION FOR BLUEFIN TUNA BE DESC-INTERNATIONAL TRADE BAN .
THIS BE DESC-REAL PROBLEM FOR BLUEFIN TUNA .
OVER DESC-LAST 50 YEAR , POPULATION THIS SPECIES HAVE FALL BY AS DESC-MUCH AS 75 % .
X-IT WOULD DESC-REFORE WEAKEN DESC-INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE SEA AND PRINCIPLE DESC-RESPONSIBLE FISHING .
X-WE NEED TO GET TO ROOT PROBLEM .
FOR EXAMPLE , IN 2006 , TOTAL DESC-ALLOWABLE CATCH BE 36 000 TONNE .
THAT BE DESC-CERTAINLY DESC-NOT SENSIBLE WAY TO PROCEED .
SV MR PRESIDENT , LADY AND GENTLEMAN , LOOK AROUND X-YOU IN THIS CHAMBER .
FR MR PRESIDENT , TODAY DESC-RE REMAIN DESC-LESS THAN 15 % DESC-ORIGINAL BLUEFIN TUNA STOCK .
DESC-NEVERLESS , X-WE SHOULD DESC-NOT FORGET ABOUT JOB AFFECT BY DECISION THAT X-WE BE DISCUSS TODAY .
WHAT WILL DESC-NEW CONTROL AND PENALTY MEASURE CONSIST ?
X-IT BE DESC-DEEPLY FLAW TO PUT TIGER , DESC-POLAR BEAR , ELEPHANT AND TUNA ON DESC-EQUAL TERM .
IN SOME WAY , DESC-SAME GO FOR ISSUE DESC-CORAL AND FOR X-ITS INCLUSION IN APPENDIX IUS .
CANADIAN COAST PROVIDE DESC-GOOD EXAMPLE HOW MAN SUCCEED IN DESC-TOTALLY DESTROY COD STOCK .
THAT BE SOMETHING THAT X-WE SHOULD REFLECT ON .
DESC-NONELESS , X-I THINK THAT COMMITTEE X-POSS PROPOSAL BE DESC-GOOD ONE .
IN X-MY VIEW , DESC-BEST AND MOST DESC-APPROPRIATE WAY BE TO INCLUDE X-IT IN APPENDIX IUS .
EUROPEAN FISHERMAN FACE DESC-STRONG DESC-OFTEN DESC-UNFAIR COMPETITION FROM DESC-NORTH AFRICAN COUNTRY .
DESC-UNILATERAL VIABILITY TUNA POPULATION MAKE NO SENSE .
X-WE MUST ENSURE THAT EVERYONE BE PLAY GAME BY DESC-SAME RULE .
IN CATALONIUM , HUNDRED JOB BE AT STAKE .
IF DESC-NOT , DESC-N X-I WOULD LIKE TO BE TELL THAT .
DESC-HOWEVER , LADY AND GENTLEMAN COMMISSION , X-I WOULD GO ONE STEP DESC-FURR .
X-IT BE DESC-POSSIBLE TO RECONCILE SE TWO .
X-I ADVOCATE NEED TO CONTROL FISHING .
X-I DESC-REFORE PROPOSE THAT THIS IDENTITY MARK BE TAKE TO DOHA AS DESC-USEFUL CONTRIBUTION TO DEBATE .
X-WE KNOW THAT COUNCIL HAVE PARLIAMENT X-POSS DESC-FULL SUPPORT IN THIS .
THIS BE DESC-IMPORTANT MATTER BECAUSE X-IT RELATE DESC-MAINLY TO CATCH BY EU FISHING FLEET .
DESC-PRACTICAL IMPACT DESC-SUCH LISTING WOULD BE DESC-UNCERTAIN .
DEBATE BE DESC-CLOSE .
VOTE WILL TAKE PLACE ON WEDNESDAY AT 12 NOON .
INCLUDE DESC-CORAL IN APPENDIX IUS DESC-REFORE SEEM DESC-EXCESSIVE AND DESC-UNCORROBORATED BY DESC-SCIENTIFIC DATUM .
FOR SE REASON , X-WE BE AGAINST INCLUSION THIS SPECIES FAMILY IN CITE APPENDIX IUS .
COURSE , X-WE HAVE TO BE DESC-PRAGMATIC .
PUT BFT ON APPENDIX X-I CITE WOULD COST X-MY COUNTRY X-POSS ECONOMY DESC-CLOSE TO 2 % GDP .
X-IT BE NO DESC-DIFFERENT THAN ASK TO DESC-CLOSE DESC-DOWN WHOLE SALMON INDUSTRY IN SCOTLAND IN ONE SWIPE .
DESC-NEARLY 1 % LABOR FORCE WOULD LOSE X-Y JOB .
X-IT BE LINK TO DESC-OR AREA , WHICH BE WHY AGREEMENT BE DESC-NOT REACH UNDER SWEDISH PRESIDENCY .
DESC-FURRMORE , ARRANGEMENT WILL APPLY TO EVERY COUNTRY IN EUROPEAN UNION .
IDEA COHESION CONTINUE TO BE COMBINATION DESC-SOCIAL COHESION , DESC-ECONOMIC COHESION AND TERRITORIAL COHESION .
X-I THINK X-IT DESC-REALLY BE DESC-VERY DESC-GOOD THAT X-WE BE DESC-NOW DESC-ABLE TO TAKE THIS DECISION .
CREATION DESC-NEW MARGINALISE AREA , ALTHOUGH WITH DESC-DECENT AND ERDF SUPPORT HOUSE , BE DESC-DEFINITIVELY DESC-NOT X-WE OBJECTIVE .
THIS , IN TURN , HAVE LEAD TO MOST DESC-DISADVANTAGED FAMILY BE DRIVE DESC-AWAY FROM CITY CENTER .
PEOPLE DESC-LIVE IN SE PLACE EARN DESC-LOWEST PAY AND BE DESC-OFTEN DESC-UNEMPLOYED OR DESC-DEPENDENT ON DESC-SOCIAL HANDOUT .
X-I DESC-FIRMLY BELIEVE , DESC-HOWEVER , THAT DESC-MERE DESC-PHYSICAL INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE WILL DESC-NOT SOLVE PROBLEM GHETTO .
X-Y WILL BE DESC-ANGRY SHOULD ANY SE MEASURE FACILITATE DESC-YET MORE EU MASS IMMIGRATION .
X-IT BE ABOUT SPACE , DESC-NOT RACE .
X-IT FOCUS , IN DESC-PARTICULAR , ON ROMA PEOPLE AND DESC-ALSO ON DESC-LEGAL MIGRANT .
X-IT HELP TO FINANCE SPECIFIC PROJECT TO BENEFIT REGION , TOWN AND VILLAGE AND X-Y INHABITANT .
IN DESC-21ST CENTURY , DESC-RE BE DESC-MANY GROUP PEOPLE DESC-LIVE IN DESC-DEMEANING CONDITION .
ISSUE LIVE CONDITION ROMA BE LINK TO THAT DESC-OPEN DESC-UP BORDER .
THIS BE DESC-EMINENTLY EUROPEAN ISSUE .
TO DESC-OWN HEARTH , STOOL AND ALL !
DESC-NEW TEXT STIPULATE RATE 4 % .
X-I DESC-FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THIS DESC-FINANCIAL IMBALANCE MUST BE DESC-CORRECT .
THIS WOULD DESC-DRAMATICALLY EXPAND RANGE DESC-POSSIBLE INTERVENTION AND INCREASE EFFECTIVENESS MEASURE .
DESC-LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND NON DESC-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION SHOULD JOIN EFFORT TO HELP IN AREA TACKLE DESC-SOCIAL EXCLUSION .
X-I WANT TO STRESS THAT ALL PEOPLE DESERVE AND NEED DESC-SOCIAL HOUSING THAT BE FIT FOR PURPOSE .
SE BE ISSUE THAT X-WE NEED TO ADDRESS AS DESC-WELL .
X-I WOULD ENCOURAGE THIS HOUSE TO LOOK AT THIS AS PART PROBLEM HOUSING IN MARGINALISE COMMUNITY .
VULNERABILITY SE COMMUNITY HAVE DESC-TANGIBLY INCREASE DURING DESC-CURRENT PERIOD DESC-ECONOMIC CRISIS .
DESC-SECONDLY , TWO COMMENT ON SUBSTANCE DEBATE .
DESC-FINALLY , LET X-I DESC-WELCOME THIS DEBATE WHICH SET OUT PARLIAMENT X-POSS COMMITMENT TO INCLUSION MARGINALISE COMMUNITY .
DESC-SECOND POINT BE THAT X-IT BE , IN MANNER SPEAKING , DESC-VOLUNTARY FRAMEWORK .
DEBATE BE DESC-CLOSE .
X-WE MUST FOCUS ON DESC-REAL SOLUTION .
DESC-RECENT EARTHQUAKE IN HAITUS MOTION FOR RESOLUTION TABLE SEE MINUTE

MR PRESIDENT , X-WE HAVE DESC-CLEAR EXPECTATION COUNCIL AND COMMISSION .
X-WE EXPECT NEGOTIATION WITH CROATIUM TO BE DESC-COMPLETE AND NEGOTIATION WITH MACEDONIUM TO BE START THIS YEAR .

X-WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE TRANSPARENCY AND DESC-LESS DESC-POLITICAL INFLUENCE IN THIS AREA AS DESC-WELL .
DESC-HOWEVER , CANDIDATE MUST BE SUBJECT TO DESC-RIGOROUS AND EXACT STANDARD AS LAY OUT IN COPENHAGEN CRITERION .
X-WE MEAN THIS AND X-WE BELIEVE IN X-IT .
AS DESC-SUCH , X-WE DECLARE THAT X-WE DISAGREE WITH POSITION THAT DESC-RELEVANT ENERGY CHAPTER SHOULD BE DESC-OPEN .
X-I BE DESC-SURE THAT EVERYONE WILL HELP .
DESC-HOWEVER , BE THIS DESC-NOT DESC-UNACCEPTABLY MAKE EVERYONE DESC-EQUALLY DESC-RESPONSIBLE , MAKE VICTIM AND OCCUPIER DESC-EQUALLY DESC-RESPONSIBLE ?
X-WE NEED TO SEND OUT DESC-CLEAR MESSAGE ON THAT POINT .
IN MONTENEGRO , FOR EXAMPLE , EXISTENCE HOMOSEXUALITY BE DESC-FINALLY BE RECOGNIZE .
DESC-HOWEVER , X-WE DESC-ALSO NEED TO AVOID WATER DESC-DOWN POWER ACCESSION PROCESS BY ERECT DESC-EXTRA OBSTACLE .
DESC-BILATERAL PROBLEM , IN X-MSELVES , SHOULD DESC-NOT REPRESENT OBSTACLE TO ACCESSION PROCESS .
X-I BE DESC-SURE THAT X-YOU WILL DESC-ALSO BEGIN PROCESS NEGOTIATION WITH MACEDONIUM DESC-SOON .
X-WE DESC-NEW ALLY HAVE DESC-BRAVELY SUPPORT X-WE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM IN DESC-SEVERAL NATO MISSION .

WHY BE DESC-SO DESC-FEW CHAPTER DESC-OPEN ?
X-I AGREE THAT TURKISH GARRISON IN DESC-NORRN CYPRUS SHOULD BE DESC-MUCH REDUCE .
X-I WOULD REQUEST THAT COMMISSION LOOK INTO THIS AND ACT DESC-PROACTIVELY IN RELATION TO X-IT .
BOTH SE THING RELATE TO EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVE , BUT X-Y USE DESC-DIFFERENT TOOLBOX .

THIS BE DESC-VERY DESC-IMPORTANT .
EUROPE WITHOUT THAT BALKAN LUNG BE DESC-NOT EUROPE .
FAR DESC-STILL SELL X-Y DAUGHTER OR SWAP X-Y FOR CATTLE .
THIS BE DESC-POLITICAL REALITY .
ON THIS MATTER , PROGRESS REPORT INDICATE THAT DESC-RE BE DESC-STILL DESC-MUCH TO DO .

WHO , DESC-REFORE , WILL BE DESC-RESPONSIBLE FOR FINANCE CITIZENSINITIATIVE ?
THIS LEGISLATION MUST BE CITIZEN DESC-FRIENDLY AND X-IT MUST BE DESC-HIGHLY DESC-VISIBLE .

THIS BE ABOUT AVIATION SAFETY FOR EUROPEAN PASSENGER .
X-WE DESC-SIMPLY WANT EVERYONE WHO FLY DESC-HERE IN EUROPE TO BE TRANSPORT DESC-SAFELY AND TO ARRIVE DESC-SAFELY .
X-Y TAKE FLIGHT AND BE STRAND , AND DESC-SO X-Y HAVE NO INFORMATION THAT WOULD HAVE PROTECT X-Y .

DESC-REGRETTABLY , THIS PROCEDURE DO DESC-NOT INCLUDE OPTION RECEIVE ITEM DESC-LATER AT ADDRESSEE X-POSS ADDRESS .
COMMISSIONER , IF X-WE WANT TO HELP EUROPE BECOME DESC-COMPETITIVE , X-WE MUST FORGET ABOUT SET DESC-UP DESC-NEW AUTHORITY .
WHAT BE DESC-CLEAR BE THAT ASH CLOUD HAVE DESC-ONLY DELAY PILOTSSTRIKE WHICH HAVE BE ANNOUNCE .
X-I WOULD LIKE TO DESC-QUICKLY RAISE ANOR POINT .
THIS BE TASK AIRPORT AND AIRLINE WHICH MUST BECOME MORE DESC-OPEN AND DESC-TRANSPARENT .
X-I TAKE DESC-POSITIVE VIEW SUBSIDIARITY IN REPORT , AND X-IT SHOULD DESC-DEFINITELY BE RETAIN .
WHOEVER ORDER GOVERNMENT RELATE SECURITY MEASURE DESC-ALSO PAY FOR X-Y .

EUROPEAN UNION MUST ENSURE THAT LEGISLATION BE DESC-UP TO DATE AND THAT SUPERVISION BE IN OPERATION .
RULE ADOPT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENT .
X-WE FUTURE STRATEGY WILL HAVE TO MAKE THAT DESC-CLEAR .
ANIMAL WELFARE BE DESC-IMPORTANT ISSUE .
EUROPEAN LEGISLATION ON THIS MATTER MUST BE DESC-RIGOROUSLY APPLY , AS MR PAULSEN X-POSS REPORT RECOMMEND .
2013 CAP NEED TO BE DESC-AMBITIOUS .

X-I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS COUPLE ISSUE .
COUNCIL HAVE DECIDE TO REMOVE SOCIO DESC-ECONOMIC CRITERION FROM OBJECTIVE DESC-NATURAL HANDICAP PAYMENT .
IMPORTANCE GRANT DESC-APPROPRIATE DESC-COMPENSATORY PAYMENT FOR DESC-LESS FAVOR AREA BE DESC-INDISPUTABLE .

X-IT BE DESC-CLEAR THAT DESC-AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY NEED TO CHANGE .

DESC-ONCE DESC-AGAIN , X-I CAN HEAR GOVERNMENT SAY THAT X-WE CAN DESC-NOT INVESTIGATE X-Y STATISTICS OR X-Y DESC-BUDGETARY PROCEDURE .
WHY DO GOVERNMENT HAVE TO KEEP X-Y STATISTICS AND X-Y BUDGET PROCEDURE SECRET ?
DESC-HOWEVER , THIS PARTNERSHIP MUST BE BASE ON DESC-STRONG POSITION FOR PARLIAMENT AND FOR COMMISSION .
IN DAY TO COME , X-WE WILL BE NEGOTIATE ON FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT .

TWO ASPECT STAND OUT , IN DESC-PARTICULAR .
DESC-RE BE THREE POINT X-I WANT TO RAISE .
PROBLEM WILL DESC-ALSO CROP DESC-UP ASSOCIATE WITH HAVE DESC-NECESSARY WORKFORCE AND EXTENT X-Y TRAINING .

EUROPEAN RESOURCE NEED TO BE USE DESC-EFFICIENTLY .

SIT BE SUSPEND AT 13.10 AND RESUME AT 15.05
X-IT BE DESC-NOW TIME FOR X-WE TO CARRY OUT INTERIM REVIEW AID EFFORT IN HAITUS .
HOW BE DESC-ENTIRE AID EFFORT COORDINATE ?
PURPOSE OFFICE DESC-HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BE TO STRENGN EU X-POSS ROLE AS DESC-GLOBAL PLAYER .
SOME MEMBER STATE LAUNCH INDIVIDUAL AID CAMPAIGN AND DESC-OR ACT DESC-JOINTLY .
DESC-HIGH REPRESENTATIVE SHOULD DESC-NOW AT DESC-LAST BE REALIZE WHAT X-SHE JOB BE ALL ABOUT .

X-IT BE DESC-NOT .
TREATY DO DESC-NOT SAY THAT X-IT BE FORBID TO TAKE ON DEBT .
X-I REPEAT TREATY DESC-CLEARLY STATE THAT MEMBER STATE CAN DESC-NOT BE FORCE TO TAKE ON DEBT .
X-I BE DESC-HERE TO REPLY ON BEHALF COMMISSION .
LET X-WE DESC-ALSO BE DESC-CLEAR FROM POINT VIEW COMMISSION .
DESC-NATURALLY , X-WE HAVE BE DESC-VERY DESC-CAUTIOUS ON THAT POINT .
X-IT BE PARLIAMENT X-POSS INSISTENCE ON SCRAP DESC-NATIONAL OPT OUT FROM DIRECTIVE WHICH LEAD TO STALEMATE .
DESC-RECENTLY , X-WE HAVE SPEAK DESC-GREAT DEAL ABOUT CRISIS AND HOW TO OVERCOME X-IT .
DO X-YOU THINK THAT X-WE AND COMMISSION HAVE DO DESC-ENOUGH ?
X-I THINK COMMISSION PROPOSAL BE DESC-RIGHT ONE .

BABY GROW PRODUCE BY X-WE COST EUR 4 5 , WHEREAS ONE FROM CHINA COST EUR X-I KNOW THAT PROTECTIONIST MEASURE BE DESC-UNDESIRABLE , BUT WHAT BE ANSWER ?

THAT BE WHY X-IT BE DESC-SO DESC-MUCH DESC-DEPENDENT ON CORRECTION SOME DESC-FISCAL IMBALANCE .
IN 2009 , 2.7 MILLION PEOPLE IN EURO AREA LOSE X-Y JOB .
ALL ISSUE X-YOU HAVE RAISE BE DEAL WITH IN 2020 STRATEGY , MR DAERDEN .

DESC-HENCE , IN THIS CONTEXT , SE QUESTION WOULD APPEAR TO BE DESC-JUSTIFIED .
THIS BE DESC-JUST ONE DESC-MANY EXAMPLE JOB BE LOSE IN EUROPE .
X-YOU WORK PROGRAM DO DESC-NOT PROVIDE DESC-VERY DESC-DEFINITIVE INFORMATION IN THIS RESPECT .

FUS MR PRESIDENT , COMMISSIONER , UNEMPLOYMENT AND EXCLUSION AMONG DESC-YOUNG PEOPLE BE DESC-BIG PROBLEM .
THIS WOULD DESC-REFORE REQUIRE DESC-LARGE AMOUNT LABOR MIGRATION .
IN X-MY OPINION , DESC-RE BE SOMETHING CONTRADICTION DESC-HERE .
X-I WANT TO WIN THIS COMPETITIVENESS BATTLE DESC-GLOBALLY .
DESC-RE BE NO CONTRADICTION BETWEEN HAVE DESC-LONGER WORK LIFE AND HAVE SOME IMMIGRATION TO EUROPE .
THIS SHOW THAT DESC-RE BE PROBLEM MISMATCH BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR LABOR .
IN FACT , X-IT HAVE BE DESC-POSSIBLE TO KEEP PEOPLE IN WORK FOR DESC-LONGER .

ALTHOUGH RECOVERY BE DESC-SMALL , DESC-ULTIMATELY X-IT BE RECOVERY , AND IN DESC-PARTICULAR X-IT MUST MEAN DESC-INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY .
X-I SHALL END WITH QUESTION TO MR TAJAN X-I .
DESC-HOWEVER DESC-ELECTRIC PROPULSION TECHNOLOGY BE MOST DEVELOP .
MANUFACTURER HAVE DESC-LARGE VARIETY MODEL , AND X-Y BE DESC-SOON GO TO BEGIN MARKET X-Y .
X-WE SHOULD ALL PULL DESC-TOGER AND COMMISSION SHOULD DESC-CERTAINLY TAKE LEAD IN THIS .
DESC-SECONDLY , X-WE NEED TO EXTEND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE COVERAGE TO ALL AREA .
CAR MANUFACTURER THAT BE DESC-CURRENTLY CARRY OUT FLEET CALCULATION CAN DESC-NOT DESC-YET INCLUDE DESC-ELECTRIC CAR .
DESC-ONLY DESC-N SHALL X-WE IN GROUP DESC-GREEN EUROPEAN DESC-FREE ALLIANCE BE DESC-ABLE TO SUPPORT ELECTROMOBILITY .
REPLACE DESC-CURRENT CAR FLEET WITH DESC-ELECTRIC CAR WILL NEIR RESOLVE PROBLEM CONGESTION NOR PROTECT CLIMATE .
DESC-REFORE , NUMBER CAR MUST BE REDUCE .
IF THAT TURN OUT TO BE ELECTROMOBILITY , X-WE SHALL NEED EUROPEAN AND DESC-INTERNATIONAL STANDARDISATION .
IN X-MY OPINION , THIS BE HOW X-WE SHOULD APPROACH ISSUE STANDARDISE DESC-ELECTRIC VEHICLE .
PRESSURE FOR INNOVATION SHOULD COME DESC-NOT FROM REGULATION BUT FROM DEMAND .
BY WAY , DESC-ELECTRIC BICYCLE X-I RIDE BE MAKE IN CHINA .
DESC-MANY ISSUE THAT X-I WANT TO MENTION HAVE DESC-ALREADY BE RAISE DESC-HERE .

DESC-HOWEVER , X-Y DESC-STILL ACCOUNT FOR DESC-ONLY 1.3 % ALL VEHICLE REGISTER .
DESC-NEVERLESS , X-Y WILL DESC-NEVER COME DESC-CLOSE TO REPLACE ALL DESC-CURRENT , FOSSIL FUEL POWER VEHICLE .

ONE BE TECHNOLOGY AND DESC-OR ENERGY .
AS DESC-FAR AS TECHNOLOGY GO , DESC-ELECTRIC VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY DESC-ALREADY EXIST .
WHAT BE MORE , TECHNOLOGY USE BY DESC-ELECTRIC VEHICLE BE MOST DESC-EFFICIENT AND DESC-BEST FOR ENVIRONMENT .
DESC-ELECTRIC VEHICLE HELP DESC-RENEWABLE ENERGY , WHICH HAVE DESC-WEAK SPOT X-Y BE DESC-IRREGULAR .
DESC-ELECTRIC VEHICLE COMPENSATE FOR THIS IRREGULARITY THROUGH X-Y DESC-OWN DESC-SPECIAL FEATURE .
X-SHE RAISE ISSUE LITHIUM , ALONG WITH DESC-OR MEP WHO HAVE SPEAK ABOUT BATTERY DURING THIS DEBATE .

DESC-HOWEVER , TWO FEATURE DIRECTIVE UNDER DISCUSSION DESERVE DESC-POSITIVE RESPONSE .
THIS KIND DESC-STRUCTURAL SUPPORT AFFORD OPPORTUNITY FOR ACHIEVEMENT X-WE OBJECTIVE .
OBJECTIVE THIS REGULATION BE TO ENABLE DESC-NEW TEXTILE FIBER TO BE PLACE ON MARKET MORE DESC-QUICKLY .
CONSUMER CAN CONSULT WEBSITE OR DESC-OR SOURCE FOR DESC-ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IF REQUIRE .

COMMISSION , LADY AND GENTLEMAN , X-I BE SURPRISE THAT X-I BE DESC-FIRST TO MENTION THIS .
WHY HAVE X-WE DESC-NOT BE DESC-MUCH MORE DESC-AMBITIOUS AS REGARD DESC-SOCIAL LABEL ?

X-IT BE DESC-IMPORTANT , FOR EXAMPLE , TO TEST WHER FIBER BE DESC-ALLERGENIC .
X-WE SHOULD DESC-N GO DESC-FURR BY ESTABLISH DESC-REAL COMMUNITY PREFERENCE .
DESC-UNFORTUNATELY , DESC-LARGE PROPORTION GOODS BE PRODUCE IN COUNTRY WITH NO FORM PRODUCT CONTROL DESC-WHATSOEVER .
THIS PROPOSAL START OFF AS DESC-MAINLY DESC-TECHNICAL AND NON DESC-POLITICAL AND BE DESC-JUST MEANS TO BRING THREE DIRECTIVE DESC-TOGER .
CONSUMER BE ENTITLE TO DESC-ACCURATE , DESC-RELEVANT , DESC-UNDERSTANDABLE AND DESC-COMPARABLE INFORMATION ON COMPOSITION TEXTILE PRODUCT .
THIS WILL ALLOW DESC-SOCIAL DECISION ON PURCHASE CHOICE TO BE MAKE .
APPLICATION THIS REGULATION COULD SEE INCREASE IN COMPETITIVENESS SME .

THAT BE WHY COMMISSION HAVE ADOPT DESC-NEW AND IMPROVE APPROACH TO POLICY COHERENCE FOR DEVELOPMENT .
EUROPEAN UNION AND MEMBER STATE MUST FULFIL X-Y COMMITMENT IN THIS AREA .
TO THAT END , COMMISSION HAVE PROPOSE TO ESTABLISH RESPONSIBILITY MECHANISM WITHIN UNION .
THIS PROPOSAL BE DESC-CURRENTLY BE EXAMINE BY MEMBER STATE .
IF X-WE BE TO MAKE X-WE POLICY MORE DESC-COHERENT , X-WE MUST INVOLVE X-WE PARTNER .
THAT OPTION MUST BE USE DESC-FAR MORE DESC-SYSTEMATICALLY .

DESC-ONCE DESC-AGAIN , X-IT BE DESC-INTERGOVERNMENTAL MECHANISM WHICH BE CONCOCT WITHIN ECOFIN AND WHICH REQUIRE UNANIMITY .
EVERY DESC-SINGLE LOAN WHICH BE GRANT HAVE TO BE APPROVE BY ALL MEMBER STATE .
THIS BE WHAT X-WE BE EXPECT FROM COMMISSION , MR REHN .

PRESIDENT CUT OFF SPEAKER
DESC-HOWEVER , DESC-DECISIVE POINT BE THAT COUNCIL MUST TAKE ACTION ON LEGISLATION .
EXPENDITURE CAN BE CUT OR TAX CAN BE INCREASE .
ALL STATE CAN CUT EXPENDITURE AT DESC-SAME TIME , ALTHOUGH DESC-SEPARATELY , WITHOUT NEED ANY EUROPEAN COORDINATION .
MR VERHOFSTADT BE SAY THAT X-YOU HAVE DESC-RIGHT TO TAKE INITIATIVE .

THIS WAY , X-WE PRESERVE EUROPEAN DESC-SOCIAL MODEL .
DESC-INDEED , WHAT USE BE EUROPE IF DESC-NOT TO SUPPORT MEMBER STATE IN NEED ?
DESC-MONETARY AND BUDGET POLICY HAVE PROVE DESC-INADEQUATE IN ASSURE PRODUCTIVITY AND COMPETITIVENESS .
X-IT BE DESC-SCANDALOUS THAT GOVERNMENT AND COMMISSION DESC-ONLY REACT WHEN DESC-REAL WEAKNESS APPEAR IN MARKET .
X-WE NEED MORE EUROPE AND DESC-NOT DESC-LESS EUROPE .

THIS CRISIS BE DESC-ECONOMIC AND DESC-FINANCIAL , AND WILL HAVE GROW DESC-SOCIAL DIMENSION INVOLVE DESC-SOCIAL CONFLICT .
DESC-SECONDLY , X-WE NEED TO DARE TO TELL TRUTH ABOUT WHAT BE HAPPEN TO X-WE .
X-I THINK THAT WHAT BE NEED DESC-NOW BE MENTION ROLE MEMBER STATE .
EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT SHOULD REGAIN X-Y DESC-STRATEGIC ROLE AND GO FOR BRAVE EUROPEAN SOLUTION .
BOTH CITIZEN AND MARKET NEED MORE EUROPE .
MARKET BE DESC-WELL MASSAGE AND INFLUENCE TOWARDS GET X-WE INTO CRISIS IN DESC-FIRST PLACE .
X-I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM PRESIDENCY COUNCIL AND FROM COMMISSIONER .
WHAT BE BE DO TO POLICE THIS ?

X-WE NEED TO HELP AND ENCOURAGE THOSE COUNTRY THAT HAVE DESC-NOT DESC-YET INTRODUCE DESC-SINGLE CURRENCY .
STATE HAVE TAKE DESC-DIFFERENT MEASURE IN DESC-SIMILAR SITUATION .
X-WE CAN DESC-NOT CONSUME MORE THAN X-WE PRODUCE , NOR CAN X-WE SPEND MORE THAN X-WE CAN COLLECT .
GIVE X-YOU MORE POWER WILL DESC-ONLY WORK IF X-YOU DESC-ACTUALLY USE POWER X-YOU DESC-ALREADY HAVE .
ON DESC-OR HAND , X-IT PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY AS DESC-WELL .
SOLIDARITY AND ADAPTABILITY MUST BE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH X-IT BE FIND .

X-WE CAN DESC-NOT COMPETE WITH X-Y GOODS WITHOUT REDUCE X-WE WAGE RATE TO X-Y LEVEL .
DESC-CONSCIENTIOUS IMPLEMENTATION PRINCIPLE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT SHOULD BE PRIORITY .
PRESIDENT INTERRUPT SPEAKER
X-I THINK DESC-RE BE ONE THING X-WE COULD STOP DO , AND THAT BE RIDICULE GREECE .
DESC-NOW BE DESC-RIGHT TIME TO INCORPORATE DESC-SHORT TERM STABILISATION MEASURE INTO DESC-LONG TERM STRATEGY .
X-WE NEED VISION MARKET ECONOMY .
COMPETITIVENESS BE DESC-NOT START BUT RESULT DESC-ECONOMIC ACTIVITY .
DESC-REFORE , X-WE NEED DESC-CLEAR RULE IN EUROPE 2020 STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH SPECULATOR AND HEDGE FUND .
X-WE DESC-ALSO NEED TO BE DESC-BRAVER IN APPLY RULE TO MEMBER STATE .
ANY STATE WHICH DESC-DELIBERATELY FALSIFY X-ITS FIGURE MUST DESC-QUITE DESC-SIMPLY BE EJECT FROM EURO AREA .
DESC-OVERALL , X-WE MUST FOCUS ON DESC-SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE ENTERPRISE SME .
COMMISSION HAVE DESC-SIMPLY FORGET TO INCLUDE OBJECTIVE TO STRENGN DESC-SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE COMPANY IN THIS PROGRAM .
IN X-MY VIEW , THAT BE DESC-RIGHT WAY DESC-FORWARD AND X-IT BE DESC-IMPORTANT THAT X-WE TAKE THAT ROUTE .
X-WE ALL PERFORM DESC-BETTER WHEN DESC-RE BE SOMEBODY LOOK OVER X-WE SHOULDER .
DESC-ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE SHOULD DESC-NOW BE PROPOSE AS MATTER URGENCY .
STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT BE DESC-NOT ADHERE TO , AND DESC-FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE BE DESC-NOT MAINTAIN .
X-I WOULD LIKE TO ASK WHERE BE EUROPEAN DESC-CENTRAL BANK ?

DESC-RE BE DESC-NOT DESC-ENOUGH CONCRETE OBJECTIVE AND MORE X-Y BE NEED .
DESC-LONGER PEOPLE REMAIN DESC-UNEMPLOYED , DESC-GREATER RISK , DESC-NOT DESC-JUST POVERTY , BUT EXCLUSION .
PREDICTION SUGGEST THAT DESC-RE WILL BE SHORTAGE WORKER .
X-IT BE DESC-NOT DESC-NECESSARILY DESC-SUCH DESC-STRAIGHTFORWARD PROCEDURE TO INTEGRATE DESC-LONG TERM DESC-UNEMPLOYED DESC-YOUNG PEOPLE DESC-BACK INTO SOCIETY .
X-I HOPE SE APPEAL WILL BE HEAR AND PUT INTO PRACTICE .
X-WE NEED DESC-PREDICTIVE AND DESC-LONGTERM SOLUTION AND TOOL TO HELP X-WE MANAGE FUTURE CRISIS DESC-BETTER THAN X-WE DO DESC-NOW .
