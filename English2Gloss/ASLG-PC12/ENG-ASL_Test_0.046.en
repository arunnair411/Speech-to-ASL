an immediate and permanent ceasefire must come into force .
and I would also like to say not just for three hours a day !
the third requirement is to intensify the peace process .
experience over recent decades has taught us that peace in the middle east cannot come from the region alone .
documents received see minutes
russia !
israel must now understand that there are indeed consequences for its actions .
therefore , safety can only be achieved with an outright ban .
plant protection products play an important role in agriculture , horticulture , forestry and gardening .
finally , I would ask colleagues to support uen amendment 182 and to reject the package amendment 16we cannot prejudice this scientific assessment with a non scientific based definition .
parliament rightly insisted on legislation that would be effective and suitable for the task .
this chiefly concerns high risk substances .
our rapporteur is on the right track .
i do , in fact , have reservations about that .
we should be very strict when it comes to poisons of this kind .
the chemical industry , which agriculture needs , also has a duty to evolve and to find alternative solutions .
worse is better !
that , too , is important .
fungi unlike insects that come and go come and stay .
in the face of the irresponsible pressure exerted by ecologists , it is comforting that common sense has prevailed .
it is welcome that we have retained the three zone ruling even with considerable exemptions for member states .
i find it regrettable that we are not permitting any impact assessment of the agreement now reached .
i would like more positive thinking for the new year .
europe is showing that it is the world's trailblazer .
we are talking about a competitive disadvantage for eu producers .
in my opinion this is the basic approach .
67 % of european citizens expect a european policy to be developed in this area .
written statements rule 142 
this would give commercial channels considerable input .
secondly , how can technological impartiality be guaranteed ?
the solutions found in these countries are proportionate to the resources available .
this is the political question which we are basically required to resolve .
on the other hand , commercial broadcasters required to provide a public service also play an important role .
why ?
we require this as part of the lisbon strategy .
i should also like to say a few words about the red tape .
incentives to encourage sustainable cultivation of energy crops should not jeopardise food production .
firstly , I have introduced the principle of civil society representation into this report .
i would like civil dialogue to be based on the principles of clarity and transparency .
we agree that civil society plays an important role in european integration .
this means that the aforementioned document does not have legal force .
this all brings to mind the definition of democracy .
growth has slowed down considerably , to the point of turning into an outright recession this year .
we have made many new joint discoveries during the debate in committee .
cfp and the ecosystem approach to fisheries management short presentation 
that , however , was not the situation we found ourselves in when we began .
it also restates the directive's requirement of ensuring the independence of those bodies .
i would just like to conclude with two final comments .
firstly , regarding the issue of taxation of cross border mergers .
i therefore have no difficulty in agreeing on the need to push forward in this crucial domain .
we are aware of the different opinions .
without them , there would be no euro .
the european parliament played a crucial role at the pioneering stage .
after 10 years , it has to be recognised that the euro is an unquestionable success .
it demonstrates the best that europe can achieve when everyone joins forces .
for those who do not , the euro was associated with price rises .
today , the crisis has changed many of these perceptions .
it has proven itself to be independent , efficient and self confident , and it acts decisively and quickly .
the idea that the ecb has done a good job is extraordinary .
there is nothing it can do .
what you have done with this euro is you have trapped people in an economic prison .
the anniversary is also an opportunity to debate whether britain's long term economic future lies with euro membership .
i would appreciate it if you would allow me to do that .
obviously , I supported my own report .
what has our nation gained ?
for us in a country with a small internal market , this is particularly important .
ladies and gentlemen , 2015 is not far away only six years stand between us .
i wish you success in your further work and in the next european parliament elections .
applause 
there is no question that we need a regulatory system for pesticides .
madam president , I too found this a particularly difficult decision .
written explanations of vote
i voted in favour of this report because the aviation industry in romania will benefit directly too .
however , we cannot support paragraphs 63 and 64 , which raise doubts about free trade in agricultural products .
the recent extraordinary surge in food prices rightly prompted a discussion on agricultural policies , food security and development .
it is also wrong for churches and religious communities to be given a special status among civil society organisations .
i insist that dialogue should be especially with associations that give a voice to the poorest individuals and families .
member states must therefore screen their legal systems and increase the clarity of the transposition process .
i still regret the fact that we dropped the 50 % objective .
undoubtedly , businesses will shed jobs and even cease trading altogether .
the meat scandals in recent years show quite clearly how easy label fraud is .
that is why we have voted against .
it is therefore disproportionate to collect and use data whose reliability cannot be guaranteed beyond all doubt .
this report does not speak about the reliability of biometric data itself .
in connection with this , the risk exists that they will be more easily falsified or forged .
this was also mentioned by some of our fellow members who spoke previously .
mr president , I also wish to thank mr coelho .
i therefore welcome the use of biometric data on passports and other documents .
this stays the same from conception to death and even beyond .
it can already be seen , mr cappato .
otherwise , party conferences would not be broadcast so extensively .
the eu does not have a proud tradition of transparency .
this is , of course , impossible .
they deserve our acceptance .
secondly , and even more importantly , the current text has benefited enormously from your input during the process .
the commission has also already made various commitments .
we hope for the support of the parliament in these political discussions and later in negotiations with the council .
so , is the negative response to agriculture unduly influenced by the document itself ?
this is very useful as this council decision makes for extremely effective sharing of dna and fingerprints .
i think I have more or less answered your questions .
the truth is that illegal immigration to europe continues .
the commission must carry on without losing its enthusiasm for this policy of cooperation and aid for member states .
since august 2007 the financial markets worldwide suffered from a major confidence crisis .
my question is do you acknowledge that the commission's regulatory reflexes were sluggish in this matter ?
but there is a balance to be struck between being overly pessimistic and being realistic .
the rapidly growing numbers of fake medicines have forced us to act .
health is one of our most important assets , if not the most important .
the information must be monitored before publication .
you have referred , rightly , to information to patients and you have dwelt on the detail of that .
that included veterinary medicines , as well as human pharmaceuticals .
we will not permit this under any circumstances .
the information must be based on data that has already been authorised by the approval authority .
professional users will only be granted authorisation after they have completed a training course .
often dichloromethane is used by individuals carrying out restoration work in their own homes .
you have played an important role in bringing about this proposal .
this occurs only with dichloromethane and not with the other substances .
the council must therefore permit the member states to ratify these parts of the convention .
the sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m. 
applause 
naturally , we are also interested in diversifying the supply and transport routes .
why wait ?
your work programme outlines those goals .
well , we do not bug private discussions , as he did to members of this house .
we import 99 % of our nuclear fuels !
this will confirm the sincerity of your words .
i agree with the premise of this motto .
i call on the czech presidency to carry out the resolve expressed in the prague declaration .
in 1618 , an unpleasant habsburg diplomatic mission came to hradčany whose behaviour was unprecedentedly arrogant .
i look forward to such a political defenestration now .
their coming together is determined by globalisation and the multicultural economic environment which is still developing .
that europe gave its neighbours , including those in central and eastern europe , the prospect of accession .
its programme contains the right priorities .
the family policy that I read about in your programme is an old fashioned family policy .
it is the new generation that can understand what is meant by .
american satellite states have no place in our union .
de mr president , the catania report is a real sham .
this is something that I do not agree with and find unacceptable .
pl mr president , all children have the right to the love of both their parents .
good .
last but not least , syed kamall !
various alternatives to dcm based strippers are already available on the market .
i voted in favour of the report .
his text in fact denies the most fundamental human rights 
in my view , the community cannot applydouble standardsin its internal and foreign policy .
applying this could have consequences in terms of censorship .
in writing . de I voted against the catania report .
finally , I hope that all this can be achieved by the end of this parliamentary term .
the demands it makes go way beyond what I understand by transparency .
this assists proper preparation for the elections to the european parliament that will be held in june 200in doing this we can really contribute towards greater transparency for our citizens .
we need to address broader and more complicated challenges .
mr president , 17 days of fighting in gaza have quite simply left a heartbreaking situation .
i should like to express my firm conviction before I conclude .
today , clearly , we must issue a strong demand for a cease fire , but this is not enough .
we would have saved years if we had respected the elections in palestine .
mr president , what is happening in gaza is heartbreaking .
there will never be security without peace , or peace without justice .
the western powers did not create two states in 1948 , but they should do so now .
we have avoided inserting an equals sign , however notional , between an existing state and a terrorist movement .
the sons of those who were exterminated have become exterminators .
it is no accident that there is a large difference between the gaza strip and the west bank .
we must consider each child's life to be of equal value , on either side of the border .
that is the first task to be carried out .
the use of phosphorus on civilians with the claim of civilisation is not compatible .
i think this is quintessential , and everyone agrees to this .
we are a major trading partner . we are a major funder in that region .
israeli troops should return to their barracks .
hamas has to stop firing rockets at israel .
if we do not have results , it will inevitably have political consequences in our relations with both countries .
i do not want to blame one or the other party .
second , we definitely missed an opportunity in 2004 when we discussed the gas supply security directive .
i believe we should react immediately and really find coordinated community mechanisms to respond to this type of crisis .
what has unfolded in recent weeks has led to great surprise .
in actual fact , they are now causing major detriment to their top customer .
the eu observers are helpless .
millions of people are freezing and factories are being shut .
by preventing gas from reaching the eu , ukraine involved us in its problem .
confrontation is not the solution either .
his political tone is too calm .
i wonder why it is so .
decision makers reacted to the turning off of the gas taps as if this had been completely unexpected .
i think we are quite successful in doing that for the time being .
what is at stake now is whether member states can move beyond the policies based hitherto on separate deals .
we need to secure ourselves against a future crisis by increasing our gas storage capability .
in writing . et madam president , honourable chairman .
the european union should never become a victim of such political behaviour .
we need a common external policy in the energy sector .
the introduction is covered by a special rule and there are no limits .
it is therefore high time that the eu entered into negotiations and introduced sanctions .
then I would like to make five short concluding remarks .
certainly , we are not a naval power in the czech republic so we appreciate here strong eu engagement .
the participation of belarus will depend on its domestic development .
reforms should look to the future and make the lives of ordinary people easier .
after 13 years it is time to bring the shameful srebrenica episode to a closure .
srebrenica stands as a symbol of horror and inconsolable grief .
this is at the heart of our eu's efforts in the western balkans .
we must not tolerate discriminatory and exclusionist stereotypes about individual nations , we must battle with collective guilt .
this resolution .
the president cut off the speaker . 
srebrenica , july 199 bg thank you , mr president .
it has marked me .
we must never forget the victims of brutalities committed during the war in the former yugoslavia .
i would also like to take the same opportunity to end my speech by making two points .
we all have the obligation to the dead not to make victims out of the living .
therefore , we have much to do on this .
we should not simply talk about a time limit .
the point is that these long distance transports increase costs which are , ultimately , passed on to the consumer .
this was an area in which we were to improve the situation .
we talk about costs .
how should this be organised , and who would provide such training ?
these are two things that cannot be equated , but to an extent we have been doing so .
the owner beats the horse .
monitoring by europe leaves something to be desired and is still very much organised at national level .
even now , the european commission refers to national reports which it will be assessing on paper .
the president cut off the speaker 
i would like to try and answer some specific questions .
however , no member state has done so .
a total of six member states were inspected in detail in 200these are some more specific facts relating to the questions that have been raised .
you have stressed that you do not have decision making powers with respect to the unesco procedure .
ladies and gentlemen , I would like to respond to one speech in particular with which I profoundly disagree .
on the subject of the resolution , my group discussed this again yesterday evening .
de mr president , ladies and gentlemen , everyone has agreed to an addition to paragraph voting time
our presence only prolongs the war and the resulting suffering , rather than eliminating them .
some definitions have been incorrectly transposed in 15 member states .
moreover , the only thing that this offensive will achieve is to intensify the conflict .
it is imperative that the european parliament express its views on the crisis .
the conflict between israel and gaza has simply gone on too long .
war , both civil and regional ,
nevertheless , there are signs that mr lukashenko is slowly warming to the west .
the iranians themselves must perform this task .
to this end , a 32 member national council for democracy and development was set up to govern the country .
consequently , the trade union confederations cntg and ustg became the main force in the fight for democracy .
in this case , the elections are to be held in two yearstime .
i support this resolution .
the international community unanimously declared this to be a further step towards media censorship in kenya .
many of the new member states , among them romania , for instance , have no legislation for minorities .
pl mr president , five thousand juggernauts drive through the town of augustów every day .
handicapped citizens cannot use these cards in all eu member states .
the latest information provocation is that georgia kidnapped a russian soldier .
the matter is currently at a standstill within the council of ministers .
ro given the current climate in europe , guaranteeing energy security is becoming a priority .
this is a very serious and dangerous problem and must be resolved as soon as possible .
we need a new international economic architecture .
obviously , we are interested in international trade and its development on the basis of mutual benefit .
we are seeing the first signs .
there is a danger that protectionism will increase because of the current world economic crisis .
small and medium sized enterprises play a huge part in this .
the french government has already developed a system of additional credit insurance for the clothing and textile sector .
these initiatives do not have to cost anything .
written statements rule 142 
firstly , of course , at the level of ict products themselves .
as regards funding , we have so far invested more than eur 4 000 million in this initiative .
the fact is that we need towns and cities as partners in a new energy policy .
i trust that , as the european union , we shall maintain global leadership in this revolution .
i therefore call on you to support it in the vote in a couple of daystime .
turning finally to nuclear energy , there are some very different opinions on this subject in this house .
it may also show its passivity and risk marginalisation .
my fourth point is that our strategic document greatly complements our efforts towards implementing the third energy package .
by intelligent , I mean varied , and being open to new things and not standing still .
we can now say that noticeable action is being taken by the commission in this direction .
hundreds of companies had to cease production and pay their employees just 60 % of their wages .
finally there is the matter of the nabucco pipeline .
on the third internal market package , I would just say what it does for europe .
europe , for its part , must diversify energy sources and improve supply security .
obviously this was a political shot in the foot .
the commission recognises the essential role of development finance .
these undisturbed areas are well suited to the study of evolution , of natural changes occurring in nature .
it is also important to add one clarification to the report .
so for me , promoting wilderness tourism is a mere contradiction of the termwilderness.
women are the first to contribute to inter generational solidarity , thus participating in the creation of social relations .
that being said , your comment is obviously noted .
however , the lisbon strategy aims to ensure that 60 % of women able to work are in employment .
so , what am I talking about ?
public authorities may be considerably assisted by the participation of universities and research institutes .
i also thank mrs angelilli , who has unquestionably given us a high quality report .
there is no doubt , in this regard , that children are the most vulnerable group .
on the other side , the international cooperation of law enforcement authorities is limited .
we must make sure that child safety becomes a central issue in all eu member states .
we must be able to protect our children before they become victims .
i have raised this subject many times myself .
this , however , is a struggle against consequences .
i have noted that mr fava was hoping for a statement from the council and parliament .
that too , my group will accept .
i would like to highlight those articles that safeguard the rights of workers who have been exploited .
last year alone , there were no fewer than 12 000 in as small a country as belgium .
establishing legal penalties certainly represents a step forward .
this is not worthy of the european union .
the rapporteur suggests relaxing the union's policy towards the russian federation .
the solution for the future is a massive investment in , and development of , renewable energy .
i fully support mrs záborská's report .
i would like to see included also other cutting edge fields , such as stem cell research .
most of these live in the soil or in rotting wood and are highly sensitive to change .
even now , 46 % of the surface of the earth is classed as wilderness .
i am impressed with the commission's commitment to proportionality in the regulation of general and business aviation .
i voted in favour of the report by mrs záborská .
this commitment must be taken into account in particular in national social security and pension policies .
the report was unanimously approved in the committee on women's rights .
i am voting in favour of the angelilli report on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography .
i support a lot of what the report contains and have voted in favour in many individual votes .
nothing is more important than the health , wellbeing and future of our children .
the large majority of victims of human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation are children and adolescents .
i believe that this is a major development .
we must also do that in this case .
applause 
we are also required to effectively isolate individuals who represent a serious threat .
one is the deputy head of al qa ida in yemen , and one has blown himself up .
and this is why we must insist they be held accountable .
the prisoners of guantánamo cannot be dealt with as if they were an undifferentiated herd .
not one european government , not one national parliament , has invited us .
as the head of a police authority , this minister should pack his bags and go .
we can decide ourselves to sign a bilateral agreement with the us , as portugal has done .
torture is unacceptable and there are no exceptional circumstances to alter this truth .
there is also the tactical debate .
this is one level .
it also , through the most recent legislation , sets commonly agreed standards on return policy .
i believe that it is important to give you a few figures .
they will , naturally , be relocated around the country pending legal examination of their case .
subject internet safety programme
the call for proposals will be open to all legal entities established in the member states .
vice president of the commission . as I said , he must know a lot of people .
the commission , especially its olaf service , deals with the counterfeiting of coins .
the system is as follows .
what is also important in this particular part is that there is shared management .
a completely new instrument has been introduced the so called annual summary of all reports of paying agencies .
so the situation is improving .
could you repeat the question ?
i can only pass this question to my colleagues .
but I have not been informed that we have had any reaction from the iranian government .
we could not have imagined discussing the potential radical changes in eu iceland relations .
subject demography report
europe cannot have stepchildren , since in one sense or another , all of us are minorities .
there are few political territories within the european union where a double standard is in effect .
the establishment of internal legal standards to protect the legal status of minorities is unavoidable .
romania perhaps has the most generous and up to date legislation on national minorities in europe .
i do not have another passport .
there was a palestinian exile who took latvian citizenship .
any non citizen can acquire full rights , including the right to vote , by becoming a citizen .
that has been the greatest advantage of this committee .
if we understand that , then this task has been worthwhile .
although funding is scarce , it is crucial to technology development and to maintaining expertise .
a large proportion of this feed is exported to europe as soya .
they were wrong .
the latest set of measures was the recently approved energy package .
i have here some statistics on our work .
today , we speak of renewables and energy efficiency .
twenty per cent by 2020 was a start but only a start .
devastation will come to agriculture .
we have now adopted our climate package within the eu here in parliament .
the european commission estimates that an annual investment of eur 175 billion is required to fight global warming .
climate change is bringing about broader democratic participation by society , a society which lives with different cultural values .
i am opposed to the over simplified approach towards the agricultural sector in paragraph 189 , though .
as such , we will oppose this paragraph .
it is a way of reducing energy bills , which will please consumers .
climate protection can be accomplished , but the measures need to be swift and consistent .
the transport sector must reduce co2 emissions by 20 % by 20therefore , I would like to urge states to apply tax incentives and encourage people to use public transport .
we did not get the chance to hear all sides of the debate .
the upshot of all this is the creation ofgreenjobs in new , competitive enterprises .
the european parliament has not remained silent .
i now invite you to take the floor and give your message to the european parliament .
the checkpoints have increased from 580 to 6the world declared in anapolis the failure of unilateral and military solutions .
our starting point is human dignity . palestinian girls work just as hard in school as israeli girls .
explanations of vote
making use of scientific research and using it to develop technological solutions will automatically reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
many regions of the world are teetering on the brink of disaster .
but I do not know whether my constituents will accept that we are actually going to make any difference .
this is problematic , to say the least .
nonetheless , some principles are absolute and ought not to be sacrificed to expediency .
they have shown the will .
climate change is a fact .
the report is very sprawling .
i therefore applaud mr fava's initiative , aimed at protecting the rights of these vulnerable people .
any haphazard decisions may be fatal if we do not pay the utmost attention .
without that , guantánamo will be followed by another poor solution .
the minutes of the previous sitting were approved 
i want to remind mr pöttering and all his vice presidents 
but you prove my point thank you very much .
with our resolution , we in the european parliament are supporting kosovo in this mission .
the serbs in kosovo must ensure that they avoid this type of situation .
eulex might be beneficial to the european union , but could this also be said of kosovo ?
applause 
therefore , romanian social democrats will be obliged to vote against this report .
this final report really is a final report .
eulex itself cannot do this job .
some do one thing , others do another .
only compensatory duties at the borders of the european union can re establish a genuine and fair international exchange .
the carmakersslump is also the result of their bigger faster heavier philosophy over recent years .
the industry is already in serious trouble .
however , in this case , 12 members requested the floor .
i realise that there are huge practical difficulties .
it is very clear .
every citizen has the right to consular protection .
i was repeatedly assured that the spanish have a consulate in mumbai and those that were there know this .
as you know , I can only accept two supplementary questions in addition to the original author's .
would he ensure that our concerns are communicated before the necessary legislation passes through the us congress ?
subject measures to improve the energy efficiency of buildings
for your information , I am meeting the chair of the committee after this question time .
the others are also important , but either in the long term or without such a huge impact .
subject tobacco control and smoking cessation
i am anti smoking , not anti smokers .
what is more important the lisbon treaty or this ?
the dramatic consequences of theklausstorm in southern europe debate 
the commission would also stress the importance of moving forward on the revision of the solidarity fund regulation .
you have just told us , mrs vassiliou , that you hope to receive parliament's support .
therefore , I think that this threshold should also be reviewed to show that european solidarity really can exist .
it still holds the wind speed record over 250 km / h .
the second , which was on an unprecedented scale , was the storm of 27 december 199it flattened most of our forests , for the first time .
the debate is closed .
currently only two such cases are still open , but are about to be closed .
we know that this oil should not have got into the animal feed chain .
that is appropriate if we have tight controls on it .
we do not think outside the box .
why do farmers not welcome inspectors in , seeing them as protectors of their businesses ?
thus , the oil is diluted and added to the feedstuffs .
this is bad news in the current difficult economic climate .
we cannot deny that .
this is ordinary people suffering , and it is our farmers who are suffering financially .
the debate is closed .
let us take a brief look at the history .
it is a good example of parliament working .
within the european union , there are , in fact , 5 million farmers and 60 million pet owning households .
this report has been a long haul .
i believe that this regulation will encourage european farmers to promote their agricultural products .
i would like to thank the rapporteur .
development impact of economic partnership agreements epas 
it is wrong , in my view , for parliament to make promises of this kind .
we should not forget that internationalised enterprises show great innovative ability .
the eu has now taken on primary responsibility for assisting kosovo internally .
however , it is clear that the casualty figures claimed by the ltte have been exaggerated .
nevertheless , the death of civilians in a war zone is tragic whenever and wherever it occurs .
according to the international red cross , the shells hit the paediatric department .
once again , who is picking up the pieces , ladies and gentlemen ?
although the government has promised to investigate the attack on journalists , that is no solution .
they are more interested in the territory than in the people who live in it .
unfortunately , the thai authorities have not provided those refugees with the humanitarian assistance they so clearly deserve .
madam president , this has happened for the last five years .
fr madam president , you are absolutely right .
written declarations included in the register rule 116 see minutes
we find this unacceptable !
thank you very much , mr chichester .
the quartet will have a crucial role to play in the months ahead .
soon , most probably , there will be a new israeli government .
the population is suffering enormously .
what about jerusalem , though ?
would that majority be able to react to an election victory by integrating hezbollah ?
ind / dem . mr president , today we are debating a resolution about humanitarian aid .
the lack of drinking water constitutes no less a threat than the lack of food .
in this report , we are intentionally selective .
i shall turn now to the individual points of this report .
we then make clear statements about the capabilities that we need to develop .
the eu has been incredibly successful in peacemaking .
we have to move on the eu has to move on in its peacebuilding .
we have idealism but we do not equip ourselves with the means to reach those targets .
therefore , I would not overrate the role of the lisbon treaty .
each new eu military mission is problematic .
to begin with , resources and means .
someone spoke about helicopters .
mr president , several speakers are putting a brave face on things this afternoon .
concerning the mediterranean , we have objected to a reductionist approximation that only talks about security .
indeed , this is also mentioned repeatedly in the report by mr saryusz wolski .
how can we try to solve these problems together that of energy security , for example ?
despite the verbal outpourings in sharm el sheikh and jerusalem , nothing has yet been done in this respect .
the new administration has made a very positive start , also symbolically by the announcement to close down guantánamo .
afghanistan is also an important issue .
that could enhance understanding and also the development of democracy beyond our eastern borders .
now , of course , mr solana , you are asking for more capabilities and more aid .
i am certainly not questioning the remarkable work of the civilian observer mission on the ground .
is there progress in this area ?
i have already touched upon finance .
this is a job for the next parliamentary term .
the nabucco project must be adopted as a strategic goal by the whole eu .
mr president , first of all , I would like to congratulate ms napoletano on her report .
the model followed in barcelona has not had the expected results .
there are four requests from the chamber for leave to speak under thecatch the eyeprocedure .
regrettably , there are still several countries that have serious problems in this domain .
this decision has only deepened the european crisis .
mr president , eu funds distributed by the lottery offirst come , first servedis wrong .
the act states that the bulgarian orthodox church is traditional to bulgaria and exempt from registration .
protectionism is like a dose of cocaine for an economy .
that concludes the item .
however , let us be honest .
the barcelona process should be supplemented by the european neighbourhood policy and the objectives must be clearly defined .
how can we effectively review this neighbourhood and partnership instrument ?
let me just say a few things .
time is against us .
the debate is closed .
new financing discussions will begin this year .
this is the context of the discussion about the new policy instrument that is being held here .
i came to this debate because I was anxious to hear the arguments about legal bases .
however , I remain to be convinced .
another joint undertaking , galileo , has not been established at all .
the committee on development then started drafting a report .
the report is commendable .
social economy short presentation 
participating organisations , on the other hand , are too small to become known on a macro economic level .
these will be joint events with council presidencies and member states .
i agree that there would be significant added value in periodically reviewing progress against the objectives of the pact .
it enlivened the dialogue on energy policy in every member state .
in the current report , we attempted to draw general conclusions regarding the aforementioned action plans .
there are grounds for reiterating this at a time when state aid seems to be flowing in abundance .
we want europe to be recognised for its flexibility that would indeed be a positive sign .
if we think that the commission's proposal is good , then we must support it .
of course , we on the left welcome the reduction in vat rates as a matter of principle .
mr almunia please the stability pact is broken .
however , I do accept that reducing the taxation burden is an instrument of economic stimulation .
the amendments to the directive provide for a significant extension of the opportunities for applying reduced vat rates .
the euro sceptics are anti brussels , anti frankfurt , now they are starting to be anti everything .
i call on the council to work towards this .
the same goes for some equipment for people with disabilities these provisions are heading in the right direction .
action plan on urban mobility vote 
it was approved unanimously , with one vote against I think , in the committee on constitutional affairs .
social economy 
voting time continuation 
that is not all .
we succeeded on all counts , with one exception .
what a needless waste of resources and time .
it is a valuable tool for reducing our dependence on oil .
a definite environmental perspective should permeate all research in the fisheries sector .
we reassert their right to defend themselves and to remain themselves .
i am convinced that applying this directive will improve practical employment conditions within the community .
that is why I will abstain .
this is totally unacceptable and contravenes the principles of modern democracy .
i have therefore voted against this motion for a resolution .
the eu can also exert a positive influence on the situation in the middle east .
yet it is not a position that europe could or should have followed .
in writing . british labour meps joined with the socialist group in voting in favour of this report .
furthermore , relations with russia must be reassessed in light of the recent events in this area .
there should be enhanced eu involvement in the black sea region and an ambitious eastern partnership .
these activities should expand the free trade zone .
that concludes the explanations of vote .
decisions concerning certain documents see minutes
i appreciate what you are saying , but that was not in accordance with our rules of procedure .
all democratic forces must be extremely clear on this matter .
neither do we need to have guards physically present in some places , especially in strasbourg and luxembourg .
we still do not know the full extent of the the economic crisis which unfolded last year .
we should remember that solidarity is most important during hard times .
we do not have to fear war , but yet we see attacks such as this crisis .
this has , I believe , also been expressed by parliament in this report .
a major problem , which required lengthy negotiations , was the situation with regard to employee participation .
the story is similar to that of the european company .
it is designed for smes .
that is included in point 87 regarding the cohesion fund .
it amounts to a revamped bolkestein .
we must promote entrepreneurial mindsets this is what the small business act stands for .
i would just like to comment on one point .
his absence is due to preparations for that .
we therefore need to strike the right balance between freedom of establishment and the interests of third parties .
suddenly , 150 employees are required in order to obtain employee representation .
perhaps the commission's proposal will be improved slightly in the forthcoming negotiations .
we must also arrive at a better definition of responsibilities in the case of people rescued at sea .
force can only be eliminated by striking at its roots .
i wish sincerely to thank all my fellow members whose significant initiatives helped make this a more comprehensive report .
if anything , it is a reason for concerted action .
in my country , which is no exception , the roma are socially marginalised and live in poverty .
4. we need to develop standards for protecting consumers against fraud , gambling addiction and the other dangers involved 
the commission has published research into the legal and economic aspects of the gambling market in 200however , this report provides some particularly useful clarifications .
that is true .
the economic crisis has taught us that strict auditing and oversight are indispensible .
supporting nuclear energy or new mines in africa is not the solution .
2009 must be a year of cooperation .
pt madam president , just a brief point of order about the agenda for this week .
we therefore have to see safety in another light here , too .
we do not want to resile from those challenging targets , but to give them that stability .
madam president , I want to raise a related matter .
first of all , I would like to congratulate mr schwab for the balanced report he has compiled .
new technologies will enable us to have safer , greener cars .
that and I will put this somewhat carefully is an exaggeration .
i therefore went to some lengths to get the agreement of the shadow rapporteurs on this point .
the amendments discussed by all the groups to permit stricter controls on furan and dioxin emissions are also justified .
mr president , at the heart of this directive is the problem of control and of costing .
no one knows how much it would cost it is called the european safety net .
i find the hysteria when we deal with soil protection or the wishes of the farmersunions incomprehensible .
permit conditions are already generally very stringent .
please reconsider the amendments which are particularly damaging to it .
this proposal is no work of the devil , nor is it a bureaucratic monster .
this is something that we can talk about .
that will not happen and cannot happen under my report .
this is a pragmatic and efficient way to mainstream transparency into all our policies .
outsiders , citizens if you like , should not be given them then .
we want increased transparency and citizens must be able to follow the democratic debate .
we are speaking now about privacy in the era of the internet and not privacy as an abstract notion .
they thought I was the commissioner perish the thought !
i dare say that there are many in this house who do not fully know how this place works .
i rest my case .
you can declareadoptedornot adopted.
we have concerns in ireland about road safety issues .
it must be rejected .
you cannot bring in regulations that are destructive and make pig and poultry farmers go out of business .
these are not issues that the european parliament can underestimate .
mr president , quality food is not an aspiration in europe it must continue as a reality .
99.2 % of my region's businesses employ fewer than 49 people .
such a rare event deserves to be highlighted .
we do not need temporary procedures , let alone a host of mutually incompatible mechanisms .
the use of personal data is beneficial to public safety .
the commission's proposal is very poor .
i believe that conducting an information campaign on this issue is essential .
if the big companies fold , the little ones will inevitably follow .
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
in any event , this really is a major piece of legislation , since it contains seven texts .
a consolidated framework for european accreditation of classification companies will also allow us more effective control of our shipping .
of all the major world economies , europe is the most dependent on the transport of goods using oil .
the revenues thus generated must be used to reduce the external costs .
this reinforces the polluter pays principle .
the problem , which is starting to cause serious difficulties , lies in the imposition of a congestion charge .
mr president , I want to say a word on the need to include co2 emissions in the eurovignette .
it should not be for the eu to dictate aone size fits allapproach in this area .
this includes work aimed at increasing the energy savings and efficiency of the buildings concerned .
the second question was about the young and the old , and how they can communicate better .
that brings me to the third question what about the price of the communications ?
i would recall the convention on cybercrime and its additional protocol .
we have already introduced private storage earlier than we normally do .
so please trust me that we will continue to keep an eye on the situation .
as a result , there are many different labelling techniques in operation within the eu for sheep products .
questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing see annex .
the aim is to offer this option to parents who want it .
it is clear that governments may not cut back on public services , not even during the current crisis .
i have , I am afraid to say , heard no answer from you today on that question .
of course , life is not like that and mothers often work outside the home .
children are our future .
in addition , the number of single parent families is on the rise .
at this point , a fundamental question arises which will determine the direction of further deliberations .
childcare helps families and society as a whole , and it can help the most vulnerable children too .
if one part of the body hurts , the whole body hurts .
colleagues have raised the issues of why people feel the need to move to look for work .
the debate is closed .
i hope that the european parliament and the council will come to a rapid agreement over this matter .
mr president , I commend the priority given to this debate .
statements by the president
it means taking adequate measures to improve energy efficiency .
as for the causes of this crisis , the most important point today is to learn the lessons .
in conclusion , we must act .
our fellow citizens sometimes ask what the purpose of europe is .
applause 
these economic recovery plans will not equip the european economy to face the future .
he has lost his marbles !
you have not made a financial stimulus of 3.3 % in europe you have not !
i welcome these moves towards a more intensive approach and flexibility .
the current crisis shows that member states that responded to this request now perform better than others .
commissioners , we are looking forward to further proposals on this subject from the commission in 200it is important to emphasise the significance for a successful economic recovery of measures to support employment and business .
let us have a recovery plan with substance and with action , and not just words .
further steps are to be taken at the spring 2009 european council in this regard.
it is proposed that we should only allow the purchase of eurobonds with swedish and danish crowns .
it turns out , however , that this is not true , and that it is a bluff .
today , we have to face up to the challenges of an economic and moral crisis .
i will be really brief .
yesterday , ecofin reached an agreement on reducing vat in labour intensive services sectors , such as restaurants , etc .
i agree with everyone who says that things could perhaps have been done better .
what will parliament therefore ask of the commission ?
the latest forecasts for 2009 predict economic growth at a level of 1 % or lower .
yet in the current economic crisis , there are signs that european solidarity is being undermined .
all member states need to be involved equally in decision making .
on the contrary , openness and the spirit of competition need to remain the basis of our activities .
we must make effective use of every opportunity available to us .
the commission will only consider its proposal after the two branches of the budgetary authority have adopted their positions .
oral explanations of vote
we must also make sure that we avoid protectionism in europe .
i just wonder if this report is actually heading in the right direction .
german taxpayers and this is rarely acknowledged have always propped up the whole system .
as such , I confirm my vote in favour .
i therefore support the rapporteur's recommendation to approve the draft recommendation agreed with the council .
the current crisis is more than just an economic and financial crisis .
this is not enough , however .
however , unless it speaks with one voice , this will result in loss of credibility .
this must be a priority during the financial crisis .
this is why the effective and rapid restoration of the award of credit must be ensured urgently .
the house rose and observed a minute's silence 
what is the way forward ?
i also wish to say to mr lax that the problems with sis ii do not affect vis .
i have participated in these debates from the very beginning .
in fact , this is not just my feeling it is the feeling of the public at large .
it is not , as mr vondra said , a political problem .
therefore , it has to be said , sis ii has had to meet increasingly sophisticated objectives .
that , then , is the commitment eur 68 million .
former yugoslav republic of macedonia progress report 200let me begin with croatia .
we would like to take this opportunity to stress the strategic importance of turkey .
unfortunately , the accession negotiations with croatia are currently stalled because of the border issue .
first , the parties can choose any one of the methods outlined in the un charter .
the commission's initiative provides a very solid basis for this , and a viable way forward .
this needs to change .
there is indignation about the demonstrative arrest of the mayor of the city of strumitsa and of other politicians .
firstly , turkey is not a european country , but forms part of asia minor .
we hope that henceforth there will no longer be any reason for obstructing the subsequent accession talks .
the main problem is the matter of the name .
the only british party in the european parliament that opposes turkish entry is the uk independence party .
in fact , you could say that time is money .
that would be a good thing for slovenia , croatia , the european union and the western balkans .
turkey's opposition to strategic cooperation between the eu and nato manifestly acts against the interests of the community .
this situation is detrimental to all to the european union as well as to turkey .
these are major reforms .
the gas crisis in january has demonstrated more powerfully than ever the need for the aforementioned infrastructure .
so far , it has completed proceedings against 116 accused with very different verdicts .
unfortunately , in reality , there are not enough relatives to do so .
has any thought been given to a form of harmonised training , as these are new initiatives ?
president in office of the council . I am not among the greatest defenders of the cap .
there is the economic crisis there are those ambitious environmental goals .
it is vital from the point of view of accidents , and particularly single vehicle accidents .
if I may say so , I think that is half the question .
she has referred to the recognition of qualifications .
we know from talking to midwives recently about the difficulty of getting professional indemnity insurance .
this sector is very important .
there is a wrong figure there , and it may well not be as bad as that figure suggests .
the statistics are there .
the european commission cannot fail to respond positively to this challenge and I urge it to do so .
however , for many member states this remains a very sensitive question .
there is no equivalence between terrorists and the legitimate forces of a democratic government .
i have visited this country many times as a member of the south asia delegation .
we have to revert back to peace mediation without winners or losers .
eastern partnership debate 
they also need reinforced help to consolidate their democratic institutions , statehood and rule of law .
the gas crisis in the past months has demonstrated how vulnerable europe is in terms of energy .
this makes that neighbourhood an area of conflicting interests and rivalry .
mr president , catch the eye is a good opportunity for polemics .
this is an offer , and by that offer we are trying to bring the countries closer to us .
brazil is also a country of decisive importance to mercosur .
these relations have until now been based on the 1992 cooperation framework agreement and the 1995 eu mercosur framework agreement .
mr president , commissioner , I am pleased that we are having this debate .
i hope such a summit may be held with mexico this year .
the mexico report is a very different matter , since the partnership with brazil is yet to take off .
as regards brazil for example , the subject of partnership is being settled with more mercosur dumping .
globalisation not only brings us benefits , but it also makes us more vulnerable to global crises and threats .
mexico will also be affected by the dramatic fall in oil prices .
a lot still needs to be done , but I think the way has been paved .
i feel that the eu brazil strategic partnership is beneficial for both sides .
we have always maintained that there should be a reconciliation dialogue and that the dialogue should go on .
in my opinion the paper contains some elements that could provide the basis for future talks .
it is a principle that has served us well .
he said ,we must build a great wall against separatism.
the isolation of tibet must stop for the inhabitants , for tourists , for journalists .
china has not been singled out in any way .
voting time
croatia should be allowed to accede when it is completely ready .
thank you .
i am not in favour of mr milošević he was a baleful and wicked communist .
their educational prospects are hugely diminished because they are the water bearers , if you like .
for this reason , we must pay particular attention to the pegi system for rating games .
last night , mr tannock and mr van orden argued for the complete opposite .
this proves that immigration is a human drama which creates inhuman situations .
no progress has been made with regard to religious freedom , despite the new law on foundations .
nor should the importance of research be underestimated in finding a solution to water problems .
we could not support this resolution in the final vote because these amendments were accepted .
it is clear that this is not the answer .
the new government must respect the constitutional order , deal with conflicts peacefully and thoroughly investigate the murders .
foreign attempts at mediation have been repudiated and eventually ended .
human rights are violated on a regular basis .
but , from time to time , they have flared up and there has been a flare up very recently .
most unsettling is that the majority of the perpetrators remain at large .
the vote will take place at the end of the debates .
as president obama said , it is not acceptable to put that many people's lives at risk .
parliament's committee on foreign affairs called for european military intervention a number of years ago .
what is more , there is little clarity about what the objective of such an intervention would be .
a war against the people of southern sudan has been going on there for decades .
we must take their concerns and needs seriously .
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .
dates of forthcoming sittings see minutes
they remain vivid memories for many people who , today , are eu citizens .
texts of agreements forwarded by the council see minutes
the next item is the one minute speeches on matters of political importance .
the built heritage of verespatak roşia montană has also been destroyed and its population impoverished .
the resulting shortage of labour poses a threat to the economic development of the eu member states .
the first public hearing is due to take place on 31 march .
this is exactly why it is more important now than ever for us to stand united .
thank you .
i would like to hear the commissioner today reassure us on a number of points .
there are two differences with respect to the cariforum agreement .
please allow me therefore to name some of the most important points .
the economic partnership agreements seek to guarantee continued trade and development in some of the world's poorest countries .
some critics would rather talk of lost customs revenue than of the potential for new trade .
i think , on the contrary , that we should be pleased that we have achieved so much .
the epa signed with the cariforum states provides an example but definitely not a template .
i have heard them and I have listened to them .
interim agreements are goods agreements aimed at preventing disruption of acp trade and promoting gradual integration .
this is something which I believe you have taken to heart and that you are working extremely hard on .
a few weeks ago , I attended the most recent regional acp summit in guyana .
i share some of those criticisms .
of course , it is up to individual nations how they involve their own parliaments .
i have to say we are always looking for any flexibility we might have within that too .
let me turn to a separate issue , which is the resolution .
i know that sometimes it is against his beliefs with regard to trade .
he is for open trade so it is not easy for him to come to an agreement .
mrs roth behrendt has already spoken on the subject of nanotechnology .
we are happy that our prohibition on cmr substances has been retained , but made more appropriate .
secondly , the continuing financial and economic crisis may , unfortunately , worsen the situation facing african countries .
i hope that we will get there .
we must be very aware of that .
the presentation is closed .
the presentation is closed .
achieve growing bilateral benefits for an ever increasing number of citizens
active dialogue with citizens on europe short presentation 
providing information is our responsibility and our duty , whereas decision making is the citizensright .
combating female genital mutilation in the eu short presentation 
the mass immigration that has taken place in recent years has brought this tragedy to eu countries .
this has no effect on the capacity of a european country to welcome incomers , rather the contrary .
the urban dimension must become mandatory .
i would like to thank everyone who assisted me in drafting this report .
this may help also to overcome difficulties in implementing cohesion programmes .
secondly , the lack of uniformity as regards the regional models of organisation of the member states 
the president cut off the speaker 
hence I regret the passing of that programme , particularly since nothing comparable has taken its place .
territorial cohesion is not meant to focus exclusively on regions suffering permanent handicaps .
i also approve of the allocation of additional funding for improved internet access in rural areas .
we really must concentrate on the tasks in hand .
it is important to us that the sexual and reproductive rights of women are recognised .
let a thousand flowers bloomwas , I think , the great phrase .
we do not just want to listen to one side of the argument .
this has happened to me in this case and it is something that I did not wish for .
we voted for an alternative resolution , however , in preference to the original report .
we need to take responsibility for them , just as we do all other indigenous peoples .
i therefore abstained for these two reasons .
this report needed to criticise abuses of this nature instead of tacitly approving them .
nihil novi nothing new without the common consent .
let us teach our citizens to make use of the benefits offered by the eu .
the report calls for the commission and member states to work together to harmonise existing legislation .
i think that language learning will combat discrimination and support integration of the counties of a united europe .
development of a comprehensive european strategy for regions with specific geographical features 
the eu institutions and member states should do more to support such schemes .
welcome , prime minister , to the european parliament .
they talked of a hard , long and bitter cold war .
the initiative for a global response to a global crisis came from europe .
now we must implement our recovery plans vigorously .
the european union now has a framework , provided by the commission , to address this issue .
applause 
thank you very much for this , mr brown .
so let britain be a positive partner , cast in the european mould .
however , I am convinced that the problem lies elsewhere .
you cannot continue to build this european union against public opinion .
at today's valuation , that would be usd 10 billion higher .
it was not just the fact that you got it wrong , because we can all get it wrong .
we had a power cut right across the banking system right across the world .
europe did lead the way .
statements are being made that would have been unimaginable a year ago .
parliament wanted to exercise its powers fully , which was not possible at the earlier consultation procedures .
members of parliament introducing reports on behalf of parliament are shortened without notice .
this is particularly evident today with the financial crisis and the resulting restrictions in access to investment loans .
at the same time , we have to acknowledge that our risk exposure is also increasing .
that is what mrs stauner was hoping for .
mr president , I want to thank all the members who have spoken in this debate .
i agree with all those members who have asked the banks to do more .
the main focus is results and not so much how they have been achieved .
with a good administrative system there is a clear division of responsibility .
congratulations !
i would like to do the same .
we want to make the abm / abb management tool better , not extend it over two years .
in addition , all the eu finance ministers must at last make a national statement of assurance .
all three institutions must find the political courage to do this together .
we must get to grips with this .
these include climate policy jobs and growth and foreign and development policy .
what strikes me is the fact that almost eur 5 billion from the 2008 budget remained unused .
it is not our current parliament that will carry it out .
flexibility alone is not the solution to the problem .
just allow me to give you an example involving money from the solidarity fund .
a number of member states have introduced scrappage incentives to stimulate demand .
it is now time to act and to implement these plans in full .
i would like to look more closely at general motors .
we need to support those people engaged in the car industry .
i expect community policy to take account of that .
all of this is being provided by the eib .
in addition , military no fly zones prevent planes from flying in a straight line from one airport to another .
however , we should not only be concerned about improving functionality here and now in the current crisis .
the airlines have blatantly exploited this in the current situation the crisis , plus bad winter weather conditions .
its profits are set to drop by 12 % .
faced with this data I have launched an inquiry by the directorate general for energy and transport .
to conclude , I am grateful to you once again .
the commission will not hesitate to make a legislative proposal if the industry does not introduce a voluntary agreement .
strict , standardised regulations are certainly needed , as some member states are already using external service providers .
let me deal with nanotechnology first .
we must be consistent in the political message we send to the commission and to citizens .
if some people are concerned about nanotechnology , then they should be able to make a different choice .
it is animal cruelty and we are opposed to it .
we must not allow the foods in question to be open to misleading consumers .
i would also like to thank the commissioner for what she said about animal cloning .
substances that deplete the ozone layer recast debate 
the uen supports this regulation .
consequently , I totally agree with additional measures being taken to limit or even ban ozone depleting substances .
opening of the sitting
we agreed that all of the short term measures must be temporary and that is how we view them .
it has put the brakes on investment in renewable energy .
you said that geithner's way is the wrong way and leads to hell .
applause 
i personally feel very sorry for you .
if we cannot agree on our common cause then we cannot hope to punch at our collective weight .
america will come to the g20 with her own agenda .
at the summit eur 5 billion was also allocated to the anti crisis package .
roosevelt heavily attacked the oligopolies , the big companies in the us , and reregulated the economy .
that is winning the economy and it is winning the hearts of citizens for europe .
there is a great difference between proclaiming fine words on a street corner and putting them into practice .
berlusconi did that before the last elections and I have no wish to repeat his mistake .
i have already mentioned the stimulus packages .
we are not under time pressure from day to day to come up with the new regulation .
i think it would be good to say something about the eastern partnership .
mr barroso , you said that we are doing well we are investing 3.3 % .
well , the calculation is simple .
unfortunately , I do not believe that the czech republic alone is to blame .
that dogma is completely wrong .
another point is the solutions for eastern european countries and countries that are not in the single currency .
this must also be the outcome of the meeting of the g20 countries .
this must not be allowed to happen !
the european central bank will have an even more important role .
that is an arrogant statement .
and , most importantly , the crisis is no excuse for protectionism .
eur 5 billion for strategic energy projects and broadband internet .
determined to do what ?
now we are waiting for a response from the six countries which have a direct interest in the programme .
ec cariforum states economic partnership agreement vote 
before the vote on amendment 2 
i should like this to be recorded in the minutes .
this issue is still regulated on the basis of the 1944 chicago convention .
it is not a manufacturing industry , although it does create some jobs .
our approach to industry during this economic downturn must be holistic .
i think it is important to address the performance and sustainability of the aviation system .
the reports dealing with thesingle european skyinitiative are therefore following the same timetable .
so there will be noblank cheque I abstained .
in the automotive sector there is an enormous potential for moving in a green direction .
the report's second objective is to strengthen cooperation in practice .
i believe that this strengthening will benefit both parties and also the international community as a whole .
when we agree , we can set the terms of the global agenda .
thirdly , afghanistan is a key issue for both europe and the us .
in the commission we are all working very hard to contribute our fair share to our common reinvigorated agenda .
this will then set the scene for a successful eu us summit in washington , probably in june .
this report is not only about enhancing transatlantic relations but also about balancing them .
the report we are dealing with today recommends a strategic enhanced partnership and the process leading to it .
it obliges americans to obtain an international guarantee of immunity before participating in united nations operations .
instead we need a resolution on how to proceed over the fundamental issues affecting the world today .
that is certainly true .
we ought to take advantage of that fact .
we cannot fail .
good news !.
they are now responding .
for example , we are now being asked to provide greater strategic input on afghanistan .
interim trade agreement with turkmenistan interim agreement with turkmenistan debate 
in particular , some political prisoners have been released , and there has been increased cooperation with the un .
since the regime change in turkmenistan , we have increased our cooperation in this area .
articulate clearly any figure that is mentioned .
so , between these two extremes , what should we do ?
we know that negotiations are under way , but they are not completed .
it is not a question of advocating turkmenistan's isolation , but of engaging with the country .
well , we should take two pencils , one in each hand .
the president cut off the speaker 
as for dialogue with belarus , this is necessary , but not at any price .
it is about values more important than party differences .
i , myself , am a historian .
europe's conscience cannot be clear without fully examining and remembering the past .
yes , it is necessary to investigate and justly condemn the crimes .
it is not a matter for academic study .
the europe of today should remember the victims of 20th century totalitarian regimes worldwide .
in russia last year , stalin was voted one of the 12 greatest individuals in history .
communism must be condemned with all the means at our disposal .
democracy has provided freedom of thought , expression and movement .
the hungarians in romania , the people I represent , are such a case .
that is a symptom of having been sent to siberia .
even at that time , the west capitulated morally to the soviets .
last but not least is the question of where the debate should lead .
the idea that problems can be eliminated by eliminating people is one of the principles of stalinism .
there are many different kinds of fanaticism .
it is feasible .
i would also like to express my thanks for the support I received for my amendments .
their proposals weaken civil rights and the privacy of citizens .
up to the present day , the internet does not forget .
it is a new arena for the exchange of opinions that is sorely needed for political mobilisation .
the security services of various countries have traded the personal data that they have obtained by monitoring the internet .
i truly hope that we can achieve this with the cooperation of the industry .
laws must apply to the internet as they do everywhere else .
let me read , in particular , how balanced we have attempted to be with this report .
mr president , I thank the commissioner very much indeed for his opening statement .
with regard to last year's resolution , it is important to add the following five points .
we agree that measures must be taken to ensure full compensation of those victims .
theopt insystem guarantees that victims affected by the infringement of competition law will actually be compensated .
there is not much I can add , except perhaps on the legal bases .
documents received see minutes
madam president , commissioner , the food aid programme is essential today .
the programme has helped one in six of the people in need .
and all of this is cofinanced in the name of universality .
that is not the point today .
such liberalisation has always been to the detriment of fragile populations , fragile producers and fragile areas .
we have consistently said that this is an extremely complex issue .
the commission should not make the same mistake again in this case .
applause 
de mr president , ladies and gentlemen , I voted against the report by mrs batzeli .
thus I support the call for an investigation into the margin share in the production and distribution chain .
it is a corrupt scandal .
we serve nobody by failing to recognise that essential point .
it is a shame that president pöttering does not somehow follow your example in so many ways in this .
i share the opinion expressed in it that it is important to preserve freedom of expression .
many points are worded in a long winded way or duplicated .
in writing . due to a conflict of interest , I abstained from all votes .
i feel that the powers in question should be immediately transferred to euskadi .
moreover , the statements and pronouncements by the new us president himself leave no margin for doubt .
i would prefer to abstain from the vote on the motion for a resolution on an ec turkmenistan trade agreement .
i hope that it will receive the support of members .
it also gives a purpose to cultural tourism .
forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting see minutes
we are grateful to janusz onyszkiewicz for his report and the recommendations made in it .
we call upon russia to respect the principle of the independence of the written and electronic media .
it is not didacticism that is needed , but justified criticism .
i must underline that I am very , very disappointed by what is in the report .
there is nothing more important than freedom , health and life itself .
it is not enough just to criticise , or regret , continuing human rights violations in russia .
i agree that we need greater trust and understanding between the eu and russia .
this report highlighted the new strategic interest in the arctic region .
we fully recognise the growing strategic importance of the arctic region .
this means either extending existing legislation or adopting new legislation .
any measures will have to be applied in full compliance with the international law of the sea .
the european union wants us to meet our objectives of renewable energy .
as it is for the united states , the arctic should be a strategic priority for the european union .
in addition to unclos , there are a large number of other relevant international and regional instruments .
the call for a responsible approach towards the arctic is an sos and an issue of global governance .
i remember that we sat together on article 13 hearings all that time ago .
a wheelchair user or a guide dog user should have free access anywhere within the european union .
it is possible to raise these things , even if one is committed to fighting discrimination .
this proposal does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity .
anyone valuing freedom of choice for parents will not allow this freedom to be curtailed .
the use of the institution of marriage cannot be accepted in any way other than in the christian sense .
it was no easy task .
if anything , on some points my concerns are the opposite of mr mauro's .
we have accommodated you throughout .
discrimination is a serious problem in europe and beyond .
the revision of the european social fund regulation that we will adopt tomorrow will therefore enter into force immediately .
this is indeed a considerable sum .
it will eliminate the delays in implementing the fund's aims .
the same poll also found that parliament inspired the most confidence in the respondents .
the advances , in particular , could be paid out in full at the start of may .
the joint debate is closed .
one minute speeches on matters of political importance
i trust this success will be maintained during the remaining three months .
we have often emphasised how our culture is enriched by its diversity .
no other european citizens have ever had their right of free movement so grossly violated .
national consultations with slovak citizens took place on 28 29 march .
how many were there ?
did fishermen cross their path ?
these rules will also be applied in a more harmonised way .
this is a brilliant example for the rest of the house .
this is dangerous for all the other road users .
what I am advocating , however , is a clear , predictable , reasonable system .
mrs lichtenberger reminded us of the importance of these provisions for road safety .
that is all I have to say .
mrls alone do not protect consumers .
thank you again to all colleagues and the commissioner for cooperation on this report .
i am delighted that there is such a broad consensus on these issues .
allow me to explain , therefore , where the commission's immediate priorities lie in this connection .
the commission sets great store by the complete , correct application of the directive .
this approach , therefore , is not the right one .
the issue here is something very important european citizenship .
the commission takes the view that it is high time there was a specific policy programme on european citizenship .
i urge parliament not to sit back and do nothing .
i welcome the fact that the report specifically mentions the roma .
it is positive that agreement can be reached at first reading .
the compromise proposal for a regulation on the ecolabel will help to remove these doubts .
romania's parliament palace consumes as much power as a town with 20 000 inhabitants .
this requires unambiguous criteria , of course .
if it is in it , it must say so , and what it says must be correct .
in my opinion consumption is the fundamental characteristic of the consumer society .
special attention to be focused on smes .
in addition , the law grants custody of children only to the father and grandfather .
parliament did not agree to accept the oral amendments 
we did not have time to discuss these documents adequately , however .
before the vote 
i think it has much merit .
applause 
this will help better cultural exchange and cooperation between the eu and third countries .
but the principal reason why I abstained was because this turns the whole principle of jurisprudence upside down .
i believe that this report by mrs buitenweg is a perfect illustration of this .
unfortunately it also imprisoned history and its documents .
we would like our history to be accessible .
those steps undermine the territorial integrity of georgia as insisted upon in the relevant united nations resolutions .
we need to strengthen european citizenship because it is the central plank of freedom of movement .
this is why the rapporteur is introducing a new concept of intra community migrant , a species that is proliferating .
that is why I have voted in favour of the buitenweg report as a whole .
however , this resolution has no impact on the legislative process .
in writing . russia remains an important strategic partner for the eu .
the annexation of sovereign georgian territory cannot be brushed under the carpet , either by russia or the eu .
no update has taken place .
i voted in favour of the report onbetter schools an agenda for european cooperation.
the continuous training of teaching staff and the introduction of modern teaching methods are extremely important factors .

de mr president , mon 810 was approved in the european union in 199it was subsequently approved again in 2008 and then , a few days ago , it was prohibited .
one minute speeches on matters of political importance
this message is directed to the european commission so that it can take the necessary initiatives .
in the official police report filed the next day there was no mention at all of the incident .
i beg leave to delay the house and thank you for this opportunity .
it is time for us to take stock of the situation .
my objective has been to create an agency with greater independence and decision making powers .
the discussions and proposals demonstrate that parliament shares the policy objectives and wishes to vigorously improve current performance .
but that would hinder and damage all the things that we can achieve by an open electricity market .
the targets for buildings with zero net energy consumption constitute a significant part of the reworked directive .
furthermore , in some countries the cost of installing and operating mobile phone networks is higher .
some of these means are even suggested by the regulation .
so it is a great day for europe and a great day for european consumers .
transparency is vital to the functioning of a market .
it is a great moment which shows to citizens that meps are taking them seriously .
how we should regulate it is a matter which we can still discuss .
i would like mr łuckiewicz to accept our thanks on behalf of the court of auditors .
no more small , creative projects ending up being ridiculed in the euro sceptic press !
this is the discussion about tolerable risk .
we must start now .
in the case of the latter , 2007 was actually its first year of operation .
we can only be delighted at the record levels of implementation of contracts and payments under the edfs .
the council is responsible because it is losing interest it is not here .
the member states are responsible because they are not applying the regulations with enough rigour .
that is sometimes rather difficult and , particularly during election time , occasionally hard to represent .
i would like to make the following points on the latter two agencies 
we have fulfilled our duty today .
like the financial crisis , pandemics , climate change , immigration and serious crime , fish are alter globalists .
in recent years women's dignity and calling have taken on a new dimension .
the vote will take place on wednesday 22 april 200written statements rule 142 
agenda for next sitting see minutes
amongst them is the issue of management of risk .
for several reasons , administrative burdens hit smes harder than bigger companies .
that is one insight .
conflicts of interest have been overcome there will be no advisory services in addition to credit rating activities .
frankly , I think you are going to get on really well with each other .
that is ultimately the way to make a statement .
there is no incentive for those who could change these policies to do so .
let us therefore make a start with new financial morals .
the directives that are being discussed today are important and , in my opinion , balanced .
it would appear that in official communiqués not a word is said on this subject .
i have to say that without their work and their help , we would not have achieved this .
let us hope that we can get that back .
the proposal on the table today concerns one of the core values of the union , namely solidarity .
this is not a codecision procedure .
applause 
before the vote 
we should not be choosing to come to strasbourg at all .
this is what we should also be aiming for in the case of tyres .
this is something we do not agree with , and we also voted against it at committee level .
the tools ?
i should like to point out the following in this connection 
those are the reasons why I oppose paragraph 17 of the mcguinness report , which is otherwise problem free .
energy efficient smartmeters will also be introduced .
traffic noise , of which tyre noise is an important component , is a major cause of ill health .
the reason for my abstention is not complicated .
nuclear energy will have a vital role to play in the future of energy in our societies .
i therefore voted for this report .
in 2009 , it has already been announced that 225 will go .
that would be absurd .
we on the committee on budgetary control are nice people .
the third reason is the respect and the preparation for the lisbon treaty .
now we shall be conducting an election campaign where things are being shifted to brussels again .
i now come to the third text in question access to the international road haulage market .
i too could not agree more .
the thwarting has been fierce , which is very bad news .
the legislation is therefore not just bad in times of crisis , it is also symbolic .
london taxis are also known for their quality .
some say they want to see restrictions , whilst others say we have far too many restrictions .
the recently submitted commission proposals will complete this legal framework .
among these , those who use inland waterways represent just a small minority .
in other words , we must take great care .
as I see it , one issue is now almost in perpetual motion in this connection .
so first the service and then compensation for delayed services .
europe is not the preferred destination amongst our own people .
this is a public health emergency for an ageing population .
subject state aid to non eu european countries
article 61 of the eea agreement is closely modelled on article 87 of the ec treaty .
it is still premature for any assessment on how and if the member states will follow these recommendations .
subject communicating with citizens
so I definitely share your views on doing even more to mobilise citizens .
this is something that we will do in cooperation with the other institutions .
of course we will try to do that as quickly as possible , not as part of the campaign .
session musicians will benefit from a permanent 20 % levy .
commissioner , have a rethink , rework the proposal and come back !
that is out of all proportion .
i shall just refer to some of the issues raised .
rapporteur . mr president , I should again like to thank colleagues for their contributions to this debate .
written statements rule 142 
mr president , first of all I should like to thank mr savary for his work .
european citizensquality of life depends directly on making urban transport more convenient and greener .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for her work .
we have to make motorists act more intelligently .
this is illustrated by such statistics as 
extensive use in large urban areas of telematic applications , which combine transport issues with information technology and telecommunications 
we have also increased the permissible funding level for additional infrastructures from 10 % to 20 % .
if we cannot manage to shift anything now , then we really do need to question the entire programme .
the debate has demonstrated relatively broad agreement across the political spectrum .
they should not have to go to court in order to achieve it .
we therefore warmly welcome the forthcoming debate .
it would be a good idea if this were looked at again .
any form of gender based discrimination whatsoever practised by healthcare facilities , insurers or state officials is unacceptable .
that is what we are talking about here today , mr president .
furthermore , the proposal is superfluous . for the reimbursement of costs is already settled .
i myself am a beneficiary of cross border health care .
i would like to ask two particularly political questions , since it is decision making time .
those patients who want to travel are , in fact , quite few in number .
let us not waste this opportunity !
sv mr president , the whole basis of this report is wrong .
i would refer to the dutch model of dispute resolution in healthcare that was launched recently .
in the meantime governments have lost further cases with their citizens .
therefore I do not support the proposal to create 27 definitions of specialised and costly care for this purpose .
you social democrats want to force people to request prior authorisation .
why are you doing this ?
i am delighted that the juri committee has welcomed the proposal to increase legal certainty .
it will require a significant and coordinated effort from the eu and the member states at all levels .
unfortunately , what we can do in the context of the draft directive is limited .
this means that its budgetary impact will also be limited .
i believe that the european parliament and the council share similar views on this matter .
the rarity of these diseases creates challenges both from a scientific and an economic viewpoint .
patients who suffer from rare diseases this has been said need european support .
we should therefore reject amendment otherwise , it will be highly problematic .
millions of patients in europe are watching us .
the vote will take place in a few minutes .
2007 discharge frontex 
applause 
intelligent transport systems in the field of road transport and interfaces with other transport modes 
action plan on urban mobility 
however , that does not mean we must rest on our laurels .
the euro sceptic argument I do not expect will have much traction in this house .
you recited it very well .
to take advantage of those health care services is a positive step in the right direction .
i am therefore pleased that parliament has granted its approval to this report .
making buildings more energy efficient would also have a massive positive impact on carbon emissions in the eu .
i am convinced that making car manufacturers the scapegoats for climate change is a deeply flawed and counterproductive policy .
it would be naïve to ignore the role of eu regulation in the current crisis afflicting the car industry .
otherwise we will fail both the passenger and the operator .
they arise from the very nature of this sector , which is dominated by micro enterprises and smes .
it is good that the text has been toned down in this respect .
our high quality and safety standards in germany must not be compromised .
it is no surprise that , only recently , tory mep dan hannan advocated a privatised approach to healthcare .
it will result in the dismantling of national healthcare systems and will drive out patients looking abroad for healthcare .
this public signing will help to emphasise the importance of european legislation to european citizens .
it must be one of the key priorities of the eu to press for the completion of these agreements .
you know our rules of procedure as well as I do , mrs berès .
commissioner , I beg you .
we should give them realistic messages of hope .
only through coordinated action can we successfully overcome the effects of the global economic crisis .
it is important that these operations are coordinated .
this happens probably when the road to chişinău passes through moscow .
it should be obvious why this analogy is not valid .
therefore I cannot accept the assertion that the council is not paying enough attention to bosnia herzegovina .
it amounts to nothing less than a complete political , economic and social transformation .
a much more mature approach is required .
i know that in this process we can count on the support of members of this parliament .
i must say that there is a great deal of sand in that serbian engine .
the citizens , like their politicians , want to be able to travel freely .
the people in the country need to do their own work .
the report passes over all that in silence .
bosnia and herzegovina simply cannot be allowed to remain behind .
the debate is closed .
this topic has particular importance for the eu , two of whose member states possess nuclear weapons .
however , europe cannot sit passively by while moscow and washington discuss its strategic future .
the vote will take place on friday 24 april 200written statements rule 142 
at this moment we must of course applaud the 7 states that have ratified the convention .
the debate is closed .
that concludes question time .
from a political point of view , though , this change is of the utmost significance .
and most importantly can the effect be extended to non energy related products and to all products ?
this choice must not contribute to creating extra burdens on the weakest companies , thus handicapping their activity .
there is no way that the commission would support such an idea .
the construction industry does need a regulation after 20 years of having the directive in place .
all that is left for me to say is thank you all for this constructive and useful debate .
we have done a constructive job , and I believe that we avoided resorting to dictates or mutual recrimination .
improved rules and greater transparency are crucial .
however , what is good enough at home becomes unacceptable once you cross the border .
the vote will take place tomorrow , friday , 24 april 2009 , at 12 noon .
it is far more difficult to include other new products .
thirty two per cent of british muslims report being subject to discrimination at airports .
this kind of profiling is a waste of resources .
so we are talking here about effectiveness as well as civil liberties .
the parliamentary delegation , too , was a strong group .
written statements rule 142 
previous parliament resolutions have inspired a significant number of the initiatives introduced in the communication .
the document also outlines how to improve the defence of consumer rights and remove obstacles to business .
we reduce information costs by having a common currency .
the joint debate is closed .
the commission therefore gives its definite support to the common position .
unfortunately , however , very little has happened in the last five years .
the debate is closed .
mental and physical pressure is used to force the members to stay in this camp .
since then iraqi forces have started a siege around the camp .
but , first of all , we call on the iraqi government to lift the blockade of camp ashraf .
i challenge anyone to ask the high commissioner if any refugees have been transferred at any time .
madam president , I would just like to make two brief comments .
situation in bosnia and herzegovina
25th annual report from the commission on monitoring the application of community law 2007 
you have seen that we have tried to deal with these matters quickly , because they are important .
i hope that this will set a precedent for other areas .
we need to step up our controls in this regard .
this change has led to a fall in prices and greater competition on the payment services markets .
nanoparticles have a high surface area and significant surface energy , which give them the following characteristics 
needless to say , I completely disagree with extending the application of theblue cardsystem .
this parliament may ignore the wishes and lamentations of the european citizen , but I certainly do not .
thank you , madam president .

wednesday 
this is a matter which should be considered in the next parliamentary term .
although not all of the criteria have been met , the direction being taken is clear .
thirteen per cent is not only an unlucky number , it is a downright disgrace .
various activities took place on the day , at which we weighed up our activities in the eu .
we are all familiar with the stories about mistreatment of women by the taliban .
but we should not focus unduly on the negative aspects of these events .
fr mr president , I should like to address the commissioner in order to voice my concern .
de mr president , commissioner , thank you for being here and for getting here so quickly .
i assume that there is a misunderstanding between the shadow rapporteur of that group and mr cocilovo .
the commission's proposal also allows member states to set maximum levels for such benefits .
that is why the commission does not recommend that these amendments be approved .
therefore , the commission cannot accept amendment 6first of all , let me underline the great importance the commission attaches to this proposal .
written statements rule 142 
of these , 24 were concluded at the third reading following successful conciliation .
the council did not want to put an end to the opt out .
why should someone not be allowed to earn overtime if that is what they choose to do ?
it madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the failure of the working time directive was inevitable .
they , however , remembered what certain meps have forgotten .
madam president , it is really bizarre that the council should blame parliament for the breakdown in these talks .
on the contrary , it was the council at its coreper session that approved those proposals .
i would like to explain one thing .
in writing . hu madam president , ladies and gentlemen .
the definition of night work is also of great practical significance .
i think we should not confuse working time with driving time .
the debate is closed .
mexico has banned the trade .
once again I would like to emphasise this very clearly .
the regulation has been supported by many eu citizens , who are sensitive to the issue of animal welfare .
both industry and animal welfare organisations believe this is necessary .
the european union should be working towards this goal .
thus far , we had succeeded .
lessons can and must be learned by all concerned in order to avoid such occurrences in the future .
consumers often pay for the services of these consumer groups before deciding on a purchase .
agenda of the next sitting see minutes
as you heard , four rapporteurs have been working on elements of it .
in this directive we have significantly improved the rights of consumers and users in the electronic space .
indeed , this text does not promote creation .
it merely provides for widespread policing of the activities of internet users .
we need judicial control before net access is blocked .
these are practical matters that are important to the individual consumer .
i think that this project represents a considerable advance .
above all , we must protect intellectual property , but not to the detriment of consumersinterests .
in order to succeed , many different interests need to be weighed up and a good balance found .
improved competition must be central .
while we are on the subject of data packets , let me turn to the issue of net neutrality .
we want a judicial reservation , a judicial decision on fundamental rights .
rapporteur . madam president , firstly I would like to thank everybody who has participated in this debate .
however , 1992 is some time ago .
firstly , increasing energy efficiency is the quickest and the most cost effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
there are , however , two points that I must strongly oppose .
come on commissioner , please !
member of the commission . madam president , it is difficult .
marketing standards for poultrymeat 
i am not sure whether congratulations are in order for mr cashman .
as the president in office said , there is no opposition here to the european project .
it shows that trade and animal welfare are compatible and we should rejoice in that .
funding for non animal testing alternatives must not dry up .
we have protected the seal and this is good .
yet , despite that , we manage to provide value for money .
it is a missed opportunity .
during the debate in the committee on transport I introduced two amendments , which affect all transport employees .
the european commission's text is a nonsense .
the development of these alternative methods requires a budget .
in writing . sv this report recommends the amendment of an existing directive on ship source pollution .
on all these points , the modernisation of europe that has been undertaken bears parliament's stamp .
we cannot allow ourselves to slow down the pace of our efforts .
we have shown that strong and credible targets are possible .
my group follows that logic .
but can I remind you that an unemployment level of 11.1 % next year is 27 million unemployed people ?
a democratic and firmly european ukraine is key to a democratic , reliable and law abiding russia .
they believe that europe will do this better than their own member states .
we do not want a return to nationalism .
he is a committed european and a man who understands what it is all about .
i think that is important for the future .
protectionism is for sure not the solution .
the march european council decided on a more restrained format , to my great regret .
those who lose their jobs must be helped to find another one .
lifelong learning is also very important .
mobility is important , as stated at the workshop in prague .
europeans often ask what we do here in the european parliament , what good we do for them .
much is now contained in this report which will be passed during this parliament's final plenary sitting .
we can only hope that the council and the commission will also take these demands seriously .
signing and implementing an agreement for social progress and employment would be proof of this political will .
what level would the minimum wage be pegged at ?
i declare myself in favour of a social europe .
we need to invest to give workers the skills to work in that new economy .
in writing . in a few days , european leaders and stakeholders will meet at the employment summit .
europe has to take this opportunity to reduce unemployment .
the next item is question time b6 0231 / 2009 .
this is also partly the answer on using tax policy for creating jobs .
the first question was interconnection .
any power production , especially from new energy sources , cannot function if there are grid issues .
the european investment bank is very active in this process .
there are plenty of opportunities .
in what ways is the commission working to prevent the growth of protectionist tendencies in its international trade negotiations ?
this is an important component that we should factor in .
the commission's concerns have been put forcefully to the canadian authorities for quite some time now .
like mr martin , I am a supporter of this free trade agreement with the republic of korea .
i was recently in amsterdam and watched klm dealing with delayed passengers by rebooking them on a self check in .
i would maintain that the commission does not have to systematically bleed the other four fifths .
we cited as our grounds ageing and the economic cost .
you turn a deaf ear to all our arguments this is absolutely incomprehensible .
this brings me to my final comment , madam president .
at present in diyarbakir there are more than 185 minors in prison .
mr president , our civilisation is a civilisation which uses animals .
is it possible to protect an animal which we are going to kill ?
yes , it is possible , mainly by sparing it unnecessary suffering .
the committee members were of the opinion that such a ban would be unworkable .
in slaughterhouses , official inspectors perform food safety controls , mainly on carcasses .
that is a rather sensible improvement to our procedures .
i will wind up there .
for our group , the most important point is , however , proportionality .
this report was actually split into two .
i had grave reservations about the amendment that was submitted in the committee .
i think that is a reasonable quid pro quo .
these languages must therefore be recognised in the state , and the state must ask for this .
we have therefore made provision for a safeguard in any case .
it was and is always a pleasure to work with you and with your colleagues in the commission .
it is very good .
this is a good sign .
the joint debate is closed .
in my opinion however , the projects should include energy connections between poland and germany .
it has been a pleasure to work with you all .
these are the very areas where the credit crunch is biting hardest .
we have now gone through a global financial meltdown and it is continuing to cause us problems .
we have banks that aretoo big to fail, as the catchphrase goes .
mr president , I am standing here with mixed feelings in my last debate in this house .
will a special fund be set up at european level ?
the whole world , including european countries , would suffer .
i hope I have never given the impression that I did not .
it is an accusation of a serious criminal offence .
i give it to you briefly .
cfp repeal of 14 obsolete regulations 
it is now at the heart of a european parliamentary democracy unimaginable in 197together we have advanced parliamentary democracy in the european union and beyond .
the european parliament and national parliaments are now partners .
the work was completed successfully .
we are committed to the dignity of every human being .
our work has provided a good basis for the newly elected parliament to build on .
mr president , you have tackled many activities in your two and a half year term of office .
my group and I consider that you have fulfilled your duty with honour .
you not only acted politely but also took corrective action when necessary .
and you were always gentlemanlike .
renewed social agenda 
i will read it it is just a few sentences 
i am conscious that our interpreters have been here for a long time .
this abstention does not concern all other delegations referred to in the same decision , which we support .
one month from the european elections , that is a strong sign .
internet users are customers , but they are also citizens .
however , we believe these decisions are best determined by the member states .
this is not a problem , as many seem to think .
budget restrictiveness must remain a guiding principle for us as elected representatives .
i particularly refer to the proposal to have all slaughter at slaughter facilities .
we have therefore tabled an alternative resolution which contains all the elements of her report which we do support .

conclusions of the un conference on racism durban ii geneva debate 
these examples demonstrate our collective commitment to work on this issue both internally and more widely with partners worldwide .
compromises have been reached .
things look very bad for respect for human rights in many countries worldwide .
in our view , the civil rights campaigner , hu jia , must be released immediately .
however , the role of parliament is proving a little more difficult to find agreement on with the council .
that is a real shame in all senses of the word .
we need to make progress as quickly as possible , while ensuring that speed does not compromise quality .
clearly , effective legal protection is a fundamental principle .
europe cannot turn its back on its commitments to countries that once were recklessly exploited .
the principle of mutual recognition , the cornerstone of mutual cooperation , is very far from being satisfactorily recognised .
is the council aware of the responsibility that it bears at this time ?
now both the upper and lower houses have voted to approve the ratification .
the stabilisation and association process remains the overall framework for the european perspective of the western balkans .
i have three very short supplementary questions 
el mr president , I thank the president in office of the council for his reply .
speaking about the treaty of lisbon in this house is not a denial of democracy , rather the contrary .
this is behaviour that is neither credible nor forward looking .
they represent the results of intensive consultations between the members of the convention and ngos committed to democratic policy .
however , these methods can only be agreed once the vice president and high representative has taken office .
this is an excellent idea and one that I can only welcome .
first , I thank johannes voggenhuber , a veritable cornerstone of our work for democracy and civil rights .
as regards the dehaene report , I would once again like to mention the transitional period .
it is important to remember that .
it builds up democracy and makes the governance of the eu more representative , efficient and effective .
and we have not yet come to the end of the road .
it should be complicated .
nl mr president , mr dehaene's report gives me mixed feelings .
but we have plenty of time to come back to that , should the treaty indeed come into force .
it seemed for a while that it might not happen .
could I thank , first of all , all the rapporteurs of the five reports .
they are just advertising the rift that exists between the political class and the people in every member state .
when you talk about democratic accountability , let us not forget one thing .
applause 
moreover , anyone who says that a neo liberal economic constitution is being established has not read the treaty .
mr president , one issue that feminism has had an ongoing discussion about is that of the stay at home mother .
mrs oviir , your fan club has stayed to the end .
situation in the republic of moldova motions for resolutions tabled see minutes
this is my last speech in the european parliament .
we should therefore support this sector , which is still in its infancy .
it is good to be back for what is my last week in this parliament or any parliament .
after 25 years of elected politics that is an adequate sufficiency , I think .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
mr president , I would now like to round off both this speech and my work in this parliament .
just not by me .
it is right that we react quickly in such critical situations and try to find sensible solutions .
we have managed to do that .
perhaps on the last day there will also be a bag of sweets .
in short , this probably would have been a redistribution of roles under the worst of circumstances .
this is a commitment we have made there are legislative measures being discussed .
yesterday , with theyesin the czech senate , we took a huge step forward .
it is therefore the opinion of mr pöttering only that shall prevail .
i will read amendment 2 aloud .
before the vote
i hope that group rights will follow as quickly as possible .
this is a way to broaden cooperation .
the sovereignty of a parliament is shorthand for the sovereignty of the people .
we have 646 members of parliament in the united kingdom .
in writing . the european parliament has no role or responsibility to implement the lisbon treaty .
prior to that , the draft constitutional treaty was rejected in referendums in france and the netherlands .
this report welcomes the new powers that will be given to the national parliaments by the treaty of lisbon .
madagascar
that , and that alone , is what we need to resolve .
if we were debating that epa today , we would have to enter our reservations regarding madagascar .
i can remember in 1993 the visit of the then newly elected president albert zafy .
we cannot keep silent and we are calling for a return to constitutional order .
madam president , 20 years ago socialism collapsed at the pan european picnic on the austro hungarian border .
at first , hugo chávez did not talk about socialism but only about the right to a better world .
today millions of people are working illegally .
we are aware that recently the judicial institutions have opened some judicial processes against opposition leaders in venezuela .
this same sector considers that the government is showing an intolerant attitude towards criticism .
we are conscious of these facts and we are closely following the political situation in venezuela .
request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity see minutes
mr jerzy buzek
the candidates have informed me that they consent to their nomination as candidates .
i want to see a diverse europe in which every citizen receives protection .
between 1997 and 2001 I was the prime minister of poland .
for four years we negotiated poland's membership of the structures of the european union .
i will make sure that , together , we will do everything we can to change this .
applause 
election of vice presidents first , second and third ballots 
his death comes after 15 british soldiers were killed in the past month .
mr president , put the numbers on the screen so that we can all see them .
i will do everything to convince you that your decision was the right one .
i would like to give notice that I shall not be indulging in any philosophical or political analyses .
from now on I will eschew grand words and pathos .
applause 
mr president , allow me , first of all , to congratulate you on your election .
prime minister , you personally have done a good job and gained a great deal of respect .
i would also like to stress the importance of the eastern partnership initiative and its implementation .
we should therefore stop this awful campaign and tell the people of ireland the truth .
the icecap in the western antarctic is melting at an increasingly fast rate .
it is our task to answer them .
nonetheless , the institutional framework is important because it defines what we can do and in which areas .
this dream makes europe strong .
it is a question of political will , mr reinfeldt , mr barroso .
you will see that in a few seconds my six minutes will be up .
this is the question of ratification of the treaty of lisbon .
the nordic countries in particular have a lot of good examples of an active labour market policy .
thank you very much and good luck in a difficult time of upheaval .
the council of ministers must also realise this , and I would therefore ask two questions .
president barack obama gave an extraordinary speech about africa in africa the other day .
written statements rule 149 
for details of the outcome of the vote see minutes 
at the same time , however , we cannot simply move on to the business of the day .
however , I think that we must hold it within the right framework .
democracy cannot be imposed by such means .
nl may I start by warmly welcoming the new president in office of the council , mr bildt .
i am grateful for this debate .
the people's republic claims that it does not seek territorial expansion .
china's problems stem in this instance from the greying of the middle kingdom .
this is deplorable .
that need is something that I , too , very much want to stress .
resumption of the session
nato and the european union are both affected .
such aid is particularly important in the context of developing trust and reconstructing the country .
the primary responsibility for managing the crisis obviously lies with the automotive industry itself .
this strategy means that it is necessary to take a leap forward in terms of automotive technology .
opel has had problems .
let us make it real !
brussels cannot just criticise germany or other governments .
previous speakers have already talked about this .
we are dealing with people and with jobs , but also with whole regions .
my party is in favour of cars , as mr verhofstadt , too , is aware .
unfortunately , it is my impression that the commission has adopted a passive attitude in this case .
it is very important to ensure that state aid leads to a proper restructuring .
does it intend to directly cofinance anti flood and anti erosion works to avoid new disasters in the areas affected ?
i also think raising awareness and fostering a culture of prevention are fundamental .
fi mr president , the past year has been one of the most tragic for forest fires .
most of this financing should go to the prevention of fires and floods in southern europe .
the eu cannot take responsibility for matters that are subject to national decisions or for any negligence that occurs .
we need a european policy on forests that seeks both to raise their profile and to prevent fires .
this , too , will provide an opportunity to examine issues relating to forest fires .
the community's solidarity fund is a sound and valuable financial management tool .
thirdly , does the commission intend to ignore the fundamental objections raised by european engineering unions ?
therefore , there are big winners in keeping world trade moving .
we must therefore find new sources of funding , not least by reforming the current system .
worse still , these resources will not arrive quickly enough .
nothing justifies a reduction in public development aid .
the issue of international governance has already been discussed .
i would like to emphasise the regular control of finances both by donors and recipients of funding .
several members have also insisted on the reform of the international financial institutions .
many countries have a long way to go to balance their public finances .
we want to tackle head on the challenges posed by climate change as well .
at this point , I would like to thank the representatives of the political groupings .
otherwise we run the risk of falling prey to the absurd .
the budget for poseidon , the operation currently under way , is eur 11 million .
it is money down the drain .
we must ensure that frontex does not simply become a mechanism for keeping people out of europe .
is this really advisable ?
in fact , yesterday , a turkish fighter plane threatened to force a frontex helicopter to turn back .
the second point concerns the readmission agreements .
this tendency to externalise issues ultimately allows europe to free itself from its responsibilities .
can the council and the commission confirm that this agreement would prevail over the italy libya one ?
today or tomorrow .
the criminal networks that exploit people's desperation must be tackled .
it is important to emphasise that our strategy must be based on multiple elements and initiatives .
the commission and council must show more resolve in providing the necessary funding for frontex .
ec china agreement maritime transport operations accession of bulgaria and romania 
i hope that we europeans can take a stronger position in copenhagen than is currently the case .
in the near future , a very difficult election will be held in ukraine .
we are responsible for speaking up clearly at this point and we must do so .
why am I mentioning this ?
until now , we have only been equal , but we would like to be more equal .
this does not mean , however , that europe is equal .
citizens of the european union very often receive entirely different remuneration for doing the same work .
applause 
i would also like to thank you for your personal involvement in this matter in ireland .
for me , the choice is clear .
i want europe to keep its world leadership in financial services .
the first test case for such a social impact assessment should be the revision of the working time directive .
in the guidelines , I emphasise the importance of services of general interest for our european model of society .
i am committed to making my contribution to european parliamentary democracy .
we are indeed living in very exceptional times , times of uncertainty and power shifts .
there is a real danger that our achievements in european integration are called into question .
we welcome this because europe can only be built in a spirit of openness and of consensus building .
if I had been a head of government , I would also have elected josé manuel durão barroso .
it is about the direction of europe as a whole and that is not your decision alone .
we know what you are like !
because we have a system that makes them completely crazy .
for the simple reason that it is about having more and more , and still more , more quickly .
is mr barnier going to get the internal market ?
in this case , mr barroso is the wrong man for the job of president .
but it is possible that I have got this horribly wrong .
so maybe I got it wrong maybe you are the right man .
you have modified that in what you have said to us today .
that simply will not work .
i read president barroso's political guidelines with great interest .
more and more people are saying nothing good comes of europe.
good luck , president barroso , and success in your work .
these members will support you tomorrow .
mr kelly , I am sorry but this is a new procedure but we have to apply it correctly .
we are going to weaken you in front of the member states.
there is a contradiction there , so let us be honest about it .
of course it is a compromise , but europe only works as a compromise .
and yet that is , I believe , what needs to be done today .
it is simply a bridge too far and you will only feed public anger .
as many in this chamber have said already today , it is actions and delivery that count .
institutionally speaking , we are on the way from nice to lisbon .
i wish you good luck and success in your work .
it is true that the crisis is putting the member statesbudgets under pressure at the moment .
you , mr president , know this best of all .
you can count on me at the commission to be uncompromising in my defence of the european interest .
that is the european position .
that is why I have called for a new social ambition .
for this reason I support mr barroso's candidacy , but this support is not a blank cheque .
subject eu priorities for intergovernmental conference on climate change
but the discussions in the united states are ongoing .
we must come up with specific solutions for specific situations .
however , in developing countries this demographic increase is particularly large , with social and economic consequences too .
can I ask the commissioner if she would consider a thorough and full examination of the food promotion budget ?
the sitting was opened at 09.05 
firstly , rapid and forceful financial and monetary policy measures to support the financial sector and the real economy .
our goal is for the pittsburgh summit to make progress on guidelines for financing global climate measures .
for that , political will , decisiveness and courage must not fail us on the contrary .
we must also take employment into consideration .
europe has begun to put in place effective regulation , but europe must not find itself isolated .
guiding principles must be affirmed .
neither is a wish list for solving the world's problems frankly likely to win the day .
firstly , we need more europe .
secondly , we need more state .
finally , we need a better market .
many members have raised the issues that both I and the commissioner have looked at .
in summary , naturally the g20 summit cannot solve all the problems that we have discussed .
in order to do this , we need international cooperation .
why ?
in fact , however , fundamental rights are being eroded and proper public debate on them frustrated .
the next item is the council and commission statements on the eu strategy for the baltic sea area .
getting to grips with the environmental issues is , of course , one of the main priorities .
our aims and goals in this respect are clear .
the aim of the strategy for the baltic sea area is not to create new institutions .
the high visibility this provides for the strategy is extremely welcome .
no , this is wrong .
the development of transit corridors and communications networks will stimulate business and create new jobs .
fi mr president , the european union became aware of the baltic sea issue quite late on .
it is important that we take the strategy forward and thus also implement it .
the president cut off the speaker 
some members , mrs krehl and mr itälä , have raised the matter of resources .
it could readily assume a model function for other european macroregions , like the danube basin .
it is not such a bad idea , is it , ladies and gentlemen ?
the european parliament has just sent out a signal that europe is strong and has a strong leader .
therefore , with confidence and hope , we can advance towards a europe of greater prosperity and solidarity .
the europe of the 12 , of kohl and mitterrand , is no more and will doubtless never return .
once again this summer , forest fires have devastated the south of france .
we must show solidarity with our colleagues and help the countries affected .
well , the european union gives the impression that this agreement has to come about come what may .
that is excellent because it works against smuggling .
there you have it .
it is not in their interests .
it is very important that the three countries are now given visa free travel .
will the council ?
when a position of principle is at stake , a person's religion and ethnicity do not matter .
we must be particularly mindful of this .
macedonia , serbia and montenegro have definitely taken the turning for the european union .
but it actually does the contrary , because this law may well foster ignorance , taboo and stigma .
what does that actually mean ?
this proposal is currently under discussion in the council and parliament has submitted a positive opinion .
it is up to the commission to judge whether a member state is meeting its obligations under the treaties .
would you be in favour of opening up this whole area of challenges to your own offspring ?
i would say it is about the equal value of all people .
i hope that parliament will be as unified as possible in voting in favour of this resolution tomorrow .
the voice of non governmental organisations also fell on deaf ears .
question time council 
the other question was about what robust scientific data is in place to show the need for this .
subject child trafficking in the eu
now the world situation looks a little bit better .
it touches upon the conference itself but it is , of course , something that goes much further .
in difficult economic times , the authorities must take the action required to promote economic activity .
el madam minister , I appreciate your willingness and determination to give clear replies to our questions .
we will be cooperating closely on climate issues ahead of the copenhagen summit at the end of the year .
an appropriate regulation would be needed for this .
tens of thousands of jobs have been destroyed in rural areas .
european policy must be adjusted to suit a new global environment .
after this crisis , that is what the debate must be about .
the livelihoods of dairy farmers are under serious threat .
for months the milk sector has been suffering one of the worst crises in its history .
this has to change .
hu mr president , emergency measures are obviously needed , as the situation is disastrous .
we have already reserved eur 14 million for promotion for the rest of this year .
they all agree .
but quotas alone will not save the dairy sector .
longer private storage scheme for butter
energy security nabucco and desertec debate 
a large concentrated solar power plant will be inaugurated this month in seville .
why have they not up to now been involved on an equal footing in the planning and decision making processes ?
commissioner , you said this is not part of our strategy for security of energy supply .
over the next few years , electricity produced from solar energy will become significantly cheaper .
it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , I agree with commissioner piebalgs .
europe's energy security is based on a variety of sources , routes and supply countries .
i also want to highlight countries such as egypt and libya in terms of gas supplies .
pl the european union needs suppliers whose business dealings remain transparent and who fulfil their obligations .
this is our overarching goal .
the only solution for overcoming these challenges is to persevere with the appropriate measures .
i therefore consider this resolution to be an ideological disgrace .
is there no limit to our presumption ?
let me make my position absolutely clear on this .
this is therefore a huge tragedy .
that , I think , sums it all up .
the commission also has to look at diversifying energy security in the various eu member states .
that is why we voted in favour .
around 700 000 homes were left without drinking water .
the taiwanese authorities did not have access to meteorological information indicating how serious the typhoon was .
therefore , I would like to ask the commissioner the following question .
we also welcome the chinese assistance .
there is much we can do .
we can speak the truth .
that has nothing to do with interfering in national affairs .

composition of committees and delegations see minutes
i do not believe that problems of this type should exist when we have tragic situations to deal with .
protests 
when we debate something , we must subsequently vote on a resolution so that the debate serves a purpose .
fr mr president , we wish the following phrase to be added to point a 
for results and other details of the vote see minutes 
it all depends on the czechs .
the treaty of lisbon is not the end of the story .
mixed reactions 
that is not democracy .
es mr president , this parliament is the palace of the imagination , the palace of dreams .
our citizens want a clear and substantive answer .
they want us to speak forcefully on matters to do with climate protection , security issues , financial regulation .
i expect you to take this extremely seriously .
the eu commission intervened continually interfered in the process .
he is hopelessly compromised by going around with the chief executive of one of the biggest corporations supplying transport .
i became a catholic in ireland .
i am just sorry to see such a massive landslide .
this time the result was 67 % in favour and 33 % against .
it saddened me because I believe that the eu has been a force for good in the world .
i was a committed federalist even in the period when the czechs and slovaks shared the same state .
ireland does not want to be associated with british euroscepticism . dublin is not london !
can I assure them that he does .
in addition , these are people who will never be in the council of ministers .
i have consistently opposed the federalism of the lisbon treaty and the ceding of powers from nation states .
i shall repeat what numerous members have said .
i think we are all of us to blame for that .
the institutional coherence and balance of the european project is at stake .
it is certain that in this matter , much will depend on the citizens of europe .
the people answeredyeswith a two thirds majority and with a higher turnout than last time .
it is not a question of his good will or his inclination it is an obligation .
we wait with hope for the final ratifications of the treaty .
captain camara's decision not to run could allow calm to return .
i wonder , therefore , what the council is intending to do about the fisheries agreement .
please come and exercise the solidarity that has so often been mentioned today .
not even those who committed war crimes during the balkan war have been given such stiff sentences .
the crisis in the sector requires appropriate instruments and I believe that these will be used .
thus , we would contribute to the security of passengers who use airlinesservices .
i would like to ask the commissioner for a reply .
the debate is closed .

european newspapers , including the french magazine le nouvel observateur , are also threatened .
our group feels that media pluralism is not just an italian issue .
alas , the title of today's debate is italy .
what fine freedom fighters !
today , parliament has a unique opportunity to bring out and reveal our most positive attributes .
uproar 
half an hour later , the ambulance arrived to treat mrs niebler .
we are still waiting for them .
. nor are responses from the authorities .
freedom of the press is a fundamental freedom enshrined in article 21 of the italian constitution .
that concludes the vote .
that is happening in this case .
what I do strongly oppose , however , is the federalist tone of various amendments .
it is for this reason that the commission proposed the mobilisation of the esf in favour of italy .
the role of eurojust is also not clearly defined .
i am sure that they are a step in the right direction .
on the one hand , the economic crisis and its social consequences require urgent measures to restore job creating growth .
the greens had negotiated the joint motion for a resolution and obtained satisfaction on many amendments .
nonetheless , they have not signed the joint resolution so that they can make a scene in plenary .
together with the other countries of europe , we will be able to overcome the challenges we currently face .
dates of forthcoming sittings see minutes
the italian parliament has just proven that it is independent .
a large number of meps , from four different groups , have signed an appeal along these lines .
these tv repeaters allow the reception of catalan television in the valencia region .
i would like to tell you that there is no legal basis for an eu policy on sport .
so that is the first response .
clearly , I can only be in favour of a much more active role for parliament .
this fact assigns the commission functions which , in my view , are not justified .
i would therefore urge the commission to take note of the criticism expressed here in this chamber .
my country , austria , is particularly affected , due to its geographical proximity to the eastern european states .
consequently , I emphatically support the rapporteur's efforts and agree with his proposals .
there you have it I am grateful to parliament and to mr busuttil for his cooperation .
secondly , we are not throwing open the doors at random .
at the same time , our services have stepped up the governance and monitoring of the project .
i would like to ask the commission why there have been such delays and overspending .
in his political life , he has always shown himself to be competent , serious and a true pro european .
thank you for your reply , commissioner .
the commission is not part of the solution to the problem , but is actually the problem .
experts in development will also take part in the negotiating work .
developing countries are the most vulnerable countries to climate change .
man made global warming is an unproven theory based on manipulative statistics .
the efforts and views of parliament are crucial to this work .
it is not a london auction in which our task is to outbid each other .
secondly , we must take the two degree target seriously .
fair enough , but then it should be ensured that the existing funds are topped up .
the developing countries are now suffering a triple blow .
time and time again I have heard members here talk of co2 as a pollutant .
it is a life giving natural gas .
one hypothesis is that the global temperature will continue to rise .
i therefore call on the commission and the council to ensure that this subject is pursued consistently in copenhagen .
the development of such technologies is a vital component of our strategies to achieve our climate change targets .
at copenhagen , we will see 27 countries acting as one to achieve ambitious targets .
however , we cannot limit ourselves to this .
nor must we forget that climate change will require the contribution of science , technology and economics .
the european union plays an important role in , and assumes a commitment to , funding the climate programme .
this is the key to europe's climate change policy and its copenhagen objectives .
we must progress further along this road .
mr president , the scenario is the same .
for details of the outcome of the vote see minutes 
this has already been debated in the g20 and many other forums .
currently , there is no coordinated renewable energy strategy on both a european and world scale .
consequently , I voted to reject the commission's legislative proposal .
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
president of the commission . thank you very much , mr kamiński .
for 2009 as a whole , that would represent a 4 % decrease .
it was not a great result just 67 % of the people !
that is a decision for the european council .
does national democracy matter , or is the european union , in your opinion , a greater good ?
i would also like to thank mr barroso .
that is 16 % of all new jobs .
secondly , why do we keep meeting in strasbourg ?
what happened to them ?
if there are problems in the implementation , we are ready to look at it .
i am speaking in languages that I believe are more accessible and that requires an additional effort from me .
that concludes the item .
however , there is a serious difference of opinion between the council and parliament .
europe is going through its worst economic crisis since the second world war .
we will need to resolve the complex dairy issue .
there are two things that we must impress on the commission .
we support the draft budget put forward by mr surján .
it can also be seen in the exploding unemployment figures .
we have to be aware that the crisis still has not hit the labour market with its full force .
the council and the commission have just accepted eur 280 million .
i should like to start by thanking mr surján , who has cooperated on responding to good signals .
we have also increased the allocation for the programme of research for small and medium sized businesses .
they would certainly appreciate that enormously .
the vote will take place on thursday at 11.00 .
it also needs more resources .
the israeli palestinian conflict is a striking example of this .
its conclusions are fair and balanced , and universal support for them would represent a step towards peace .
i would like to thank the european parliament for its great interest in and support for this work .
however , it is also intended that the initiative will work at a pragmatic and operational level .
the eu's support for election processes around the world is important .
how can we rid ourselves of these double standards ?
i chose this career but I have somebody who has chosen to be at home .
subject language learning in border regions
this initiative will last a number of years and is already enjoying a particular degree of success .
i want a specific answer .
if you care to check in all the other member states , you will find a similar situation .
nowadays , 19 % of young people in europe drop out of school .
you said in your response to mr aylward that volunteering brings clear economic value .
the eu urgently needs a commissioner for human rights .
however , I have three questions to ask .
i do not believe , however , that the proposed measures alone can solve the problems we are facing .
the president asked the speaker to speak more slowly 
the measures proposed here are somewhat flimsy , but they are nonetheless necessary and imperative .
the other part , which has aroused by far the most interest today , is article 18so it is not a blank cheque .
i have listened to your ideas concerning a more limited period of three or four years .
closure of the sitting
a high level of employment is required for sustainable public finances .
the council will be urged to strengthen frontex and to introduce common rules for frontex operations at sea .
it must maintain the momentum of our work to address the economic crisis , mainly its impact on unemployment .
a successful outcome at copenhagen remains a primary concern for europeans and a major task for the global community .
we need a council president who can work with us effectively .
my second point is about the external action service .
you should ensure that everything is in order before you go to copenhagen .
your speeches are very important but nevertheless , I have another request for a blue card question .
we should at long last be dealing with specific issues of content .
please , please , give us tony blair as the first president of europe .
so much the better !
i would now like to return to my own topic .
as for the new financial architecture , the commission is being quite unambitious about this .
both the czechs and the sudeten germans have experienced more than enough horror and suffering through war and displacement .
the ecological debt burdens everyone without exception .
fr mr president , my question is very simple .
i have heard that there is some speculation here , but nevertheless there is still no solution .
i am very grateful for the support and commitment that the european parliament is showing in this regard .
we of course hope that the czech republic will very soon be in a position to ratify the treaty .
hence , I have voted against the resolution .
this unfortunate pattern of behaviour persists .
this very much meets the wishes expressed in the report .
it will , as your report says , evolve over time .
in dealing with the report , I have drawn attention to certain negative attitudes coming from some areas .
at a time when all member states face huge budgetary pressures , the eu should show restraint .
national governments will be reduced to the status of a parish council .
de mr president , the council's actions are not transparent .
we want to set the political priorities of the european union for the 21st century .
i believe that this is an open question .
this would allow europe to truly speak with one voice .
first of all , we , as the commission , are committed to making the eeas a success .
that is also what our friends in washington expect .
but let us be also clear .
vice president barrot is also ready to meet the committee on civil liberties delegation while in washington .
collaborating on innovations for the development of low carbon economies and energy efficient societies is particularly important .
it is a very small operation , as we know .
it is not the case that the us and the european union agree on every area .
commissioner ashton here will deal with this , and I will certainly convey parliament's interest .
should the eu , then , not get together to issue a special joint statement on dawit isaak ?
there are no other supplementaries on that question , so we will move on to the next question .
the council would nevertheless like to stress that the nord stream project is a private undertaking .
i do not know if the problems are greater there than anywhere else .
if it is for a supplementary on this issue , for 30 seconds you have the floor .
we must take all that into consideration before we move on to further regulation .
i am addressing the commission in order to ask it what it intends to do to end this injustice .
on the other hand , the new authorities in the republic of moldova are facing enormous difficulties .
mr president , the financial and economic situation in moldova can be summed up in a few words .
moldova is currently in the most difficult economic situation among all the states on our continent .
these are everyday matters that we will also have to solve in the future .
negotiations on an expanded , comprehensive free trade area will only start after the necessary conditions have been fulfilled .

that should be our contribution towards a guarantee that what we experienced can never happen again .
at the same time , I am sure that european sovereignty will gradually strengthen in the future .
indistinct or disputed boundaries are a frequent source of disaster .
but now we have to complete the task of transition .
that is obviously also true for the high representative .
we need to rekindle this flame .
what counts are the quantified commitments made by the states .
ladies and gentlemen , I began by talking about the obligation to produce results .
it is right to fight for freedom and values for all , not big jobs for the lucky few .
members here have celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and rightly so .
it is a bit too late to be asking for transparency now , mr verhofstadt .
why must the president of the council be a prime minister ?
the commission has proposed aid in the region of eur 5 7 billion during the first three years .
however , allow me to make a few comments on the current debate .
therefore , unavoidably , it has a lot of ambiguities and gaps .
my fellow members cannot fail to share my opinion .
things look similar with regard to the european union minister for foreign affairs .
in fact , we need more effective tools .
i would like to mention two things that I consider to be essential .
based upon this understanding , I think we can succeed in the implementation of the lisbon treaty .
you know what I am referring to here .
from a moral standpoint , it is unacceptable to give an opt out on such an issue .
this , of course , could easily be repealed by subsequent governments .
we are only halfway now we have to get used to the new institutional framework .
it is time for women !
we will also express our disappointment over russia's recent withdrawal from the energy charter treaty .
we hope that a stronger early warning mechanism will be established and approved at the summit .
these should therefore form the basis of our work on energy security under the new eu russia agreement .
the rising nostalgia for the soviet union and stalin is also very worrying .
please take along the results of the human rights dialogue and , furthermore , do it very publicly .
it would be naive to believe that tehran would not be able to put pressure on europe .
let me now reply in more detail to your question .
the services directive is a good example .
they do need , however , freedom to do their work .
however , when production started , the government and the local authorities withdrew their consent .
a question was asked about how the contact points would function .
proper implementation is therefore the most pressing issue , especially in the current difficult economic crisis .
germany and austria wish to maintain this restriction until 2011 , without any more serious economic and social motive .
de madam president , I will be very brief .
the population's mental health is a vital issue for ensuring a decent quality of life .
the illness also involves the suffering of close relatives .
the member states need to step up their information campaigns regarding an active lifestyle .
pt last month , the regions of europe were in the spotlight .
it would affect the majority of the eu's 271 regions .
eight months have passed since this particularly important topic was discussed in a plenary session of the european parliament .
i therefore appeal to the national management authorities to get involved .
third country nationals subject to or exempt from a visa requirement when crossing external borders debate 
to my friends there , I am saying that I am committed .
it cannot do it alone .
hu I would like to welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs .
the issue of providing visa free travel is only partially a technical one .
to leave the country to collapse into insolvency ?
the european union and its member states must be able to retain existing jobs and create other new jobs .
internal dialogue did take place later on , but has , regrettably , not yet produced a final outcome .
the elections provide opportunity and hope for the amendment of these errors .
the situation in honduras is critical , not only politically , but also in social and economic terms .
any continuation would be subject to an evaluation of the impact the proposed scheme had .
i agree with my colleagues that we should adopt the 2005 approach to origin marking .
specifically , mr schlyter asked me about the expanding of the list .
it is about the level playing field .
it is about clarity and transparency for consumers .
agenda for next sitting see minutes
there were fewer instances in which the ombudsman was forced to make critical remarks to the administrative institutions involved .
unlike court rulings , an ombudsman's decisions are not legally binding .
recently , we have seen some difficulties in relation to competition files .
my last point is about communication in practice .
this was an initiative that our group took in connection with parliament's resolution on the 2006 annual report .
we know that they are nothing of the sort .
many thanks to your team .
bulgaria actively participates in this network .
we social democrats in particular have put forward a few opinions .
moreover , national parliaments also have such an instrument .
third country nationals subject to or exempt from a visa requirement when crossing external borders 
visa exemption for some must not be to the detriment of other citizens of the western balkans , however .
around 7 million people in europe suffer from neurodegenerative diseases .
at the moment , most people have problems with this .
adjournment of the session
documents received see minutes
it appears that the european solidarity fund may be too restrictive to deal with this situation .
we request that it be communicated to the european commission and the council .
in that case president sarkozy would have had no time to prevent mr putin occupying the georgian capital .
their prospects involve either life in a camp or lead polluted mitrovica .
in any event , these were inconceivably grisly killings .
i reaffirm these commitments today , adjusted of course only to the time that has elapsed since then .
this is an amendment that could not be foreseen at the beginning .
but for us here in the european parliament , this was only the beginning .
accepting restrictions on digital freedoms and going against net neutrality is not acceptable .
two concrete answers to two concrete questions first , the declaration on article 19 relating to harmonisation procedures .
that is precisely what eu citizens now expect from us .
it is obvious that the role of civil society and of parliament should be increased .
furthermore , police cooperation now comes under codecision .
i therefore think that we can cooperate as closely as possible within the framework of the new legal basis .
it is quite clear that europol is one of the european union's success stories .
this is about accountability to the citizen , because it concerns very important decisions .
certain improvements I proposed have been adopted in this area , particularly concerning europol .
i understand the commission's motives , as well as the desire to maintain consistency , very well indeed .
simplified procedure almost excludes parliament .
rapporteur . mr president , thank you firstly for your tolerance and for your presence .
applause 
this interpretation no longer stands .
emissions from international transport must be reduced .
this has also happened .
our 30 % shall also continue to be used as a leveraging tool .
the eu will continue to press for adequate measures to be tabled in the negotiations .
i am also counting wholeheartedly on the support of the members of parliament in copenhagen .
i should like to commend the efforts of the swedish presidency and the european commission , particularly commissioner dimas .
yet what we are proposing is also realistic .
it concerns the future of the entire human race .
some people are sayinggo 10 % further .
that was the right approach to take and it had my express support at the time .
that is my appeal .
industrialised countries are responsible for high co2 emissions , so they must pay for this and support developing countries .
the presidency wants to achieve success , and it wants this above all else .
my second point is that parliament has adopted a clear position for the copenhagen summit .
what can we shrewdly achieve ?
with this objective in mind , we are working on a common response .
however , this is a sector that has suffered greatly from the after effects of the crisis .
the carbon dioxide markets in fact provide a way of creating sufficient room for investment .
it is time that we reached the necessary agreement in copenhagen for the sake of the planet .
the irish people only recently displayed their commitment to the eu by voting strongly for the lisbon treaty .
the us has a great responsibility for ensuring the success of this summit .
the climate is changing .
it is not only the russians who think of these countries as theirnear abroad.
our group's amendments aimed at upholding citizensrights have not been adopted .
in view of this , I am voting in favour of this report requesting the commission withdraw its proposal .
it is for these reasons that I have decided to vote against this report .
we shall vote against the mfa macro financial assistance being presented today to the european parliament .
we have tried to get this incomplete and therefore incorrect report taken from the agenda , unfortunately without success .
how do you evaluate this standpoint from a member of the european council ?
thank you for your question , mr schulz .
mr schulz , obviously I believe that all democratic parties have a place in democratic countries .
there is also talk of lightweights and heavyweights .
that is the second thing .
i am sure you will agree with me that she is a great talent .
so it is a very broad remit of competences .
i would like to thank all those who made the approval of this budget possible .
symbols and tears are no longer enough .
one way of increasing trust is to increase our knowledge of one another's legal systems .
victims should also be offered adequate compensation for the damage or injury they have suffered .
the commission has recently presented a proposal for a joint eu resettlement programme .
this is one aspect that the majority of member states would like to see reflected in the stockholm programme .
she called the stewardess over to complain about her seating .
the exchange of information helps combat terrorism .
my second point is the one illustrated very well by my colleague mrs hennis plasschaert .
it is nothing other than the pooling of sovereignty .
let us finally show some sense of pragmatism in our institutions !
the stockholm programme should , therefore , establish a number of incentives , and should concentrate on these areas .
the eu also needs a legal basis for combating violence against women .
many people mentioned subsidiarity .
you gave the example of a british citizen in greece .
the eu's area of freedom , security and justice is entering a decisive phase .
however , creating a europe for its citizens goes far beyond simply drafting a programme .
this turns our idea of human rights on its head .
you tell us that this is not a collective expulsion .
rapporteur søren bo søndergaard
in reality , this was nothing new .
the second was that the council refused to provide any comprehensive written answers .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 25 november 200written statements rule 149 
the sitting was suspended at 19.25 until the start of question time and resumed at 19.30 
these are major investment programmes in which many hundreds of thousands of european businesses take part .
the energy consumer rights that are in the existing european legislation are already legally binding .
member of the commission . the question is about varying consumer rights and is very timely .
an overview of these national institutions and organisations is available on the website .
i think that one of these missing links is the retail market .
that is straightforward best practice .
it is absolutely clear that europe is still the most attractive destination for tourists from all over the world .
the crucial thing is actually to also generate awareness of these tourism products .
minister coughlan , please , please get organised and leverage this unique opportunity for the mid west of ireland .
that is the social side of europe , and it is a good side .
that is what the globalisation fund allows us to do .
he said that we cannot influence business decisions .
the issue of individual budget items was also raised .
the state of play of the euromed free trade area debate 
we nevertheless hope that the commission will be in a position to respond to our question .
can the commission provide further details about the practical aspects and implications of such a mechanism ?
secondly , where is the net benefit to the european union countries ?
de mr president , I think I can say my piece in even less than a minute .
i will attempt to answer your questions , where possible .
are there adequate controls ?
safety arguments are also often put forward when someone wants to stand in the way of competition .
in my view , there are huge delays on this aspect .
it does not infringe fundamental rights , however .
hungarian members here are attacking the slovak language law .
sk I would like to remain consistently on the topic of our debate .
however , the post communist chauvinist slovak government is now putting up new walls between people , linguistic barriers .
i would like to state as a regional representative that our cooperation is exemplary .
all decisions are issued in romanian as well as in the language of the minorities in that region .
the swedish presidency will put all of its energy into this work .
we are going in the opposite direction .
secondly , the council must finally commit to a strict control system for the financial markets .
the president asked the speaker to conclude 
i would like to say a word to mr farage .
they have not been elected .
the swift programme is , indeed , a very valuable instrument for member states in their fight against terrorism .
do these personnel decisions convey an important message to us ?
cooperation between the european commission and the european parliament is hugely important here .
let me explain what I mean .
having said that , I shall now take up a number of points .
i believe that is a mistake .
finally , I would like to say one thing .
it will continue to be one of the main tasks for the european union and the new commission .
the citizens of europe expect us to deal with the problems of unemployment and the financial supervision package .
we in parliament at least have come to know mrs ashton as an excellent leader .
i am sorry that the portuguese government is not going down the route of lowering taxes .
we cannot do this by defending existing rights , but by searching for global solutions .
the solution will come from the peoples , it will come from the european parliament .
this priority on the swedish presidency's agenda has been successfully achieved .
i quote members of the european parliament shall exercise their mandate independently.
applause 
this is good and we are grateful .
we have heard three different numbers relating to the paragraph that we are just about to vote on .
we shall challenge this decision , if it is discussed again , before the court of justice .
written explanations of vote
the current situation calls for robust , proper and swift implementation of the esf .
there is no doubt that those in the countries concerned who have lost their jobs should be helped .
both the criticism and the statement about the alleged failure of icao negotiations are incorrect and inappropriate .
clearly , this means radical change in the production and consumption of energy .
the resolution voted on will serve as a road map for negotiation for the european union .
in this way , it would give an example to other countries , despite the difficulties involved .
it is more important to send a clear message of support for the stockholm programme from the european parliament .
it is also a resolution which guarantees the protection of refugees and migrants .
the eu must intensify efforts related to fighting transborder crime and terrorism .
the implementation of a free trade area requires the determined , ongoing and synergetic contribution of all parties .
the real solution lies in the creation of a european public air transport service .
we all know that the process has not been entirely easy .
the success of these would bring the country much closer to our european standards in areas of fundamental importance .
albania's and montenegro's applications for eu membership underscore the union's continued power of attraction .
let us keep that dream alive and , in time , make it a reality .
there is one thing about kosovo that the speaker before me has already said .
it is very disturbing to see how particular countries have so easily allowed russia to manipulate them .
as an accession candidate , turkey is already receiving eur 2.26 billion for the period from 2007 to 20this is obviously all about us interests .
enlargement requires existing members of the union to take certain measures .
mrs pack obviously did not hear me when I said that we are standing by thessaloniki .
that is not the problem .
i am of exactly the same opinion .
bullying a neighbouring country is never helpful .
it does not happen by itself .
i do not see our union asabsorbingnations .
unresolved problems are difficult to deal with after accession and remain unresolved for years .
the next item is the debate on 
it is essential that we in the eu take action now .
violence affects the victim , their families and children .
this responsibility is incumbent on all of us , the european institutions , the member states and organisations .
this means that existing mechanisms will have to be evolved and widened .
but , we all know that much more has yet to be done .
in order to resolve this situation , we obviously need an integrated approach , as commissioner ferrero waldner said earlier .
that is what we are trying to do with different training programmes .
then we have to help and protect the boats and all the people there .
they must therefore be classified as category at these times , they are therefore at risk of pirate attack .
i very much welcome the legislation that has been introduced in ireland , italy and other countries .
it is extremely positive that we are all so committed to succeeding in achieving smoke free environments .
we can no longer tackle these problems at the national or even regional levels .
surely we can manage that in the eu .
why ?
however , we need more and sustained assistance over time .
that is something we have to take very , very seriously .
until now , we worked the land to feed people .
we accept that .
thus , the scope of these rules is much more limited than the rules in force in the eu .
i am aware that some of you have expressed concern as regards our imports of beef from brazil .
we should lead by example therefore , playing by the rules governing international trade .
european stockbreeders are obliged to meet these standards as a prerequisite for receiving european union support .
before a ban in 2007 , 30 000 premises in brazil exported beef to the eu .
however , I really would like you to accept that you were forced to act .
past experience has shown us that you cannot leave it to commercial interests to resolve this problem .
but beef is a cash crop .
de madam president , our citizens have high expectations regarding the safety and quality of their food .
we applied very strict rules .
first , the court gives an unqualified opinion on the accounts for the second year running .
for the second time in a row , we can speak of an unqualified opinion on the accounts .
a third issue to be addressed is the whole system of comanagement .
our group believes in solidarity .
my colleagues from the united nations , the african union and other organisations have talked about this already .
i find it shocking that many errors are occurring in procurement with regard to projects .
where does the european commission stand on this ?
at present , most financial transfers are very indirect , passing through many intermediate stations .
this amounts to eur 2.7 billion and not eur 5 billion .
these irregularities relate mainly to excessive payments and the incorrect use of funds .
however , now you have the opportunity to look to the future .
we will be discussing this with the council in the next few weeks .
after all , there is strong friction here in the relationship between the european and national levels .
quite simply , I do not think this is good enough .
there are problems , however , and I wish to mention a few of them .
this is also a political issue .
nl I have been present throughout the debate .
some have said eur 4 billion , others have said eur 2 billion , and so on .
did the few errors or irregularities identified prevent projects from being completed ?
that is normal life .
you should learn about democracy , mrs gräßle .
the first of these is cooperation between the commission and the member states .
does copyright need to be adapted in the digital age ?
first , the revised settlement has been significantly narrowed in scope .
it will give students , academics and universities increased access to information and research .
we need to find an effective and practical solution to this problem .
for we must not , of course , squander this opportunity in europe .
public access to such resources is of paramount importance .
secondly , publication of out of print works requires special supervision .
before the vote 
the eu cannot continue to ignore these facts .
in other words , these are precisely the values on which the european union is founded .
europe , which has a long volunteering tradition , must help release the potential this offers .
however , I would like to raise a specific reservation over the method of assessing the agreement .
my second concern is with the proposed end of direct subsidies linked to tobacco production .
this situation is disastrous and requires effective measures , particularly on the part of the wealthy european union .
attacks and beatings of journalists multiplied .
this brings discredit upon the european parliament .
mr president , we once again have an urgent debate on vietnam and laos .
the authorities claim to have no knowledge of mr bouvanh chanmanivong .
no .
the city still retains this spirit of freedom today .
this indicates the sort of methods that china uses . these methods are unacceptable .
i fear that if we put off making a resolution , we will unduly restrict this matter .
i would like to recall some essential elements that the eu position encompasses .
we have consistently passed this message to our chinese counterparts and listened very carefully to their views .
the most important project relates to the reduction in incidences of violence .
therefore , no abstentions , but no participation either .
yes , some of you were given the floor twice , but not in one item .
it is right that , once again , this parliament shows its superior equanimity , respect and democratic maturity .
it was a written request submitted to the bureau of the european parliament .
i am continually appealing for the council to take the appropriate steps .
its objective must be to reduce the existing economic and social disparities , but in different regions of europe .
almost six months have passed , and parliament has still not found time to condemn this coup .
mr president , please write to the tunisian authorities to request the release of taoufik ben brik .
we have a partnership agreement with tunisia which contains many provisions relating to democracy and human rights .
this also goes for the population of kosovo .
unfortunately , ever since portugal joined the eu , this right to compensation has been 0 % .
farmers must not merely be producers of raw materials .
constant pressure on prices in the agricultural sector will lead to poor quality produce .
i expect the next commission to present such a proposal .
written statements rule 149 
but , of course , we can conclude the doha round only if all wto members are on board .
this is a step backwards .
for example , we have promised to abolish all export subsidies for agricultural products .
we cannot behave as if we can carry on in the same way .
blame the crisis .
we have stretched to the ultimate limit of what we can do and this actually has been recognised .
by the end of november , eur 6 billion of this overall amount had been used .
as a result of this , many jobs are both lost and created every day in europe .
the economic crisis has had a drastic impact on global trade .
this support was wide ranging in many respects .
the negotiations were held in appropriate conditions .
eur 100 million is not going to turn that situation around .
i think a review of the principles of the promotional campaign is called for .
written statements rule 149 
it related to the question of mandatory certification of toys by a third body .
it is also full of examples of so called minority opinions ultimately proving to be correct .
i have listened to him heaping blame on scientists .
these substances can be avoided .
seventy percent of toys sold are below these thresholds .
what is the commission's view on the rules that should be applied here ?
we all approached it with the intention of producing the most stringent legislation anywhere in the world .
how would we have been able to find the funds otherwise , given our tight budgetary constraints ?
of course , it was not an economic recovery package .
half a billion euros is supposed to be spent on mitigating the negative impact of globalisation .
there is no question that this budget is a burden and not a way out of the crisis .
we have just signed a treaty , but we need a new spirit .
nl mr president , we are discussing the last budget under the treaty of nice .
i should like to make a couple of brief remarks .
mr president , the 2010 budget is far from being generous just like any other budget .
the increase in spending on research and innovation is justified .
the entire funds amount to more than eur 6.6 billion .
my understanding is that there is no room for this proposal , but the situation has to be qualified .
the majority of them referred to the limitations of the budget and its structure .
to spell it out , we also expect a revision proposal for the current financial perspective .
we also support research and development , as well as lifelong learning .
i believe that it should be our duty to increase this financial resource .
that of creating paperwork , and of financing studies and reports .
if there was ever a time to take prompt action , it is now .
currently , the financial and economic crisis is changing into a social crisis and an employment crisis .
progress is supposed to serve the development of micro enterprises and the social economy .
will you take the initiative ?
are you mr 2020 ?
mr president , my question concerns the situation in greece .
we want to help them to be closer to us .
if I were the person involved , I would take the matter to the courts .
colleagues , the blue card procedure is not applicable now because these are discussions between two people .
fr mr barroso , all the same , the question was clear .
thank you , mrs ries .
we should treat our social partners a little more seriously .
regarding the issue of the mechanisms of governance , that is exactly what we are now preparing .
this was our third question hour with the president of the european commission .
i am very sorry about that we would have preferred to have had a lot of you here .
mr barroso , you are on a good enough salary , sir .
last week , the foreign affairs council discussed the situation in the middle east and adopted conclusions .
we have therefore made clear our support for the efforts by the united states to achieve peace .
we now need to think about how we can re engage a political process .
our approach should be regional and inclusive .
this was a gesture to help bring about peace talks .
this rhetorical question was put by the united states at the start of december .
in any case , mr president , the council's conclusions do not exactly incite optimism .
well , we have the policy .
i would now like to quote three of the recommendations from the report .
may I say one more thing .
as cecilia malmström has said today , the status of jerusalem should be negotiated bilaterally by israelis and palestinians .
you cannot boycott and engage at the same time .
unfortunately , the current system is characterised by abuses of fundamental rights .
once a person's name is on the list , it is very difficult to have it removed .
something must be done otherwise , I cannot follow the debate .
the measures taken as part of the fight against terrorism must be proportionate , appropriate and effective .
they are perhaps a little difficult for anyone listening to this debate to understand .
we must pursue those people to the ends of the earth and restrict them as much as possible .
all of us , without exception , agree that we need to act decisively against terrorism .
the vote shall take place tomorrow .
that is what I believe is at the heart of the treaty of lisbon .
you are indeed the face of the fight for this particular regulation and for openness and transparency in parliament .
that is not always easy .
we do not have a legislative resolution and we do not have the position of the new parliament .
i know that this is the time of year when you write wish lists .
it is important that not only parliament have full access to these documents .
during the lisbon treaty process , for better or for worse , they asked the citizens to trust them .
if anyone is afraid of that , there is absolutely no need to be .
let me take this opportunity to thank you once more for all your cooperation over all those years .
we will raise these issues in our talks with russia .
the georgian language is banned in many places .
mr president , we are discussing the aspirations of ukraine , moldova and georgia .
we will also provide further financial assistance for the aftermath of the conflict .
this , unfortunately , is sometimes quite difficult .
we cannot just ask them to come into the european union if the council is not unanimous on it .
the reason is that it has become much more vulnerable than the western part of europe .
hu mr president , influenza strikes down those who have a weak constitution .
we agree in many respects .
however , our delight is mixed with a degree of disappointment .
the euro is an important incentive for investments and economic growth , reducing vulnerability .
however , this suggestion is still pending , as you know .
madam president , I echo the remarks made by my colleague , mr almunia .
we have a duty to support , acknowledge and assist them .
the commission has a dual role in this area .
a budget of eur 2 200 000 was allocated to this initiative for 2008 alone .
it intends to support measures aimed at encouraging victims of terrorism to share their experiences .
i dedicate this speech to all the victims of terrorism .
it is an imperative in order to send terrorists a clear message that we do not forget .
de madam president , I am grateful for the opportunity to hold this debate .
therefore , we ought to think about the new and different direction currently being taken by the court .
we are discussing the principle of subsidiarity .
i am actually from an electoral constituency where 99 % of the electorate are catholic .
this religious and cultural diversity is what makes us , is what makes europe .
having said that , the commission may not act outside the legal framework laid down by the treaties .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on thursday , 17 december 200written statements rule 149 
a crucifix in the classroom does not force anyone to believe , or not to believe .
nor have I ever heard of a right entitling someone not to be confronted with religious symbols .
i would like to tell you that it is far too early to be doing this .
the leaderstask will be to move this forward to a deal .
we know that the atmosphere at the moment is not easy at copenhagen .
there has been no tough line on turkey , which continues to occupy cyprus illegally .
no , it is not enough .
yet our global trading position , relative economic weight and international competitiveness are in jeopardy .
the eu strategy for the baltic sea region was endorsed during the swedish presidency .
the swedish presidency's role was to pave the way for the implementation of the lisbon treaty's provisions .
today , in relation to the global character of the financial crisis , such options are not available .
unfortunately , amendments tabled by the confederal group of the european united left nordic green left were rejected .
the wto could manage globalisation better .
i therefore voted in favour .
that means they also died for europe , since a europe without russia is incomplete .
freedom of thought is the basis of all other freedoms .
that is behind us .
we hope that a new government will soon be in place .
we hope that the conference to be held in london shortly will create some momentum .
there can be no lasting military withdrawal from afghanistan unless a civil framework for stability is in place .
we are making a long term commitment to afghanistan .
those who have taken part in conflict in the past must be offered alternatives .
finally on afghanistan , but perhaps most importantly , we are streamlining our structures on the ground .
when looked at more closely , it is actually a mixture of naivety and complicity in their methods .
in my view , it does not .
we must rely more heavily on the emerging civil society and on the afghan reformists .
this is a major , everyday problem that we must bear in mind .
this support is conditional on transparency and clarity .
i think , however , that we should continually ask about the effectiveness of our assistance .
i would have liked more to have been said about this .
this is going to take time .
we have to be realistic .
the situations in both countries are closely linked and success in one depends on the other .
it is imperative we take action to improve the situation in afghanistan .
we launched a dialogue on human rights issues in june 200the commission is engaged in a growing number of technical dialogues with belarus on issues of mutual interest .
but naturally , the final decision on the negotiation directives will lie with the council .
thirdly , dialogue could be assisted through a relaxation of the eu's visa policy .
meanwhile 28 % of residents would like better relations with russia .
it will be a christmas present for us .
what conclusions should the european institutions draw from this ?
the second element is without doubt the need to strengthen good governance .
however , congo does not have to be a heart of darkness .
the money from this is used to procure weapons and encourage crime in this country .
lastly , there is a lot of criticism also of international criminal justice .
the atmosphere within the coordination body for southern serbia has since improved .
subject unemployment levels
thank you for your question , mrs harkin .
at the same council meeting , ministers agreed that employment is an important factor for the avoidance of exclusion .
referring to your question , sir , I am not really sure that I understood it .
president in office of the council . vessels have been the subject of questions during question time on numerous occasions .
the eu will therefore ask them to increase their efforts further in the context of an ambitious agreement .
hu thank you very much , minister , for your answer .
all this when disabled people actually account for around 10 % of our residents in the european union .
our directive would be binding for all eu member states , so that disabled people would not face discrimination .
thank you for your question .
subject iceland's application to join the european union
the sitting was opened at 09.00 
i am surprised that these guidelines are only appearing after more than four years .
mr president , let us get straight to the point here .
our approach is to create stronger networks .
life long learning is an important concept .
it must bring about sustainable development in the regions .
we will support proposals of this kind , but we will fight every attempt to destroy regional policy .
i am very concerned that the commission will fail us in this respect .
therefore , I would like to ask the commission to meet these requirements in the funding criteria for 20it would also , of course , have huge economic , financial and social consequences for those regions .
lastly , global warming does not seem to me to come under cohesion policy .
it has caused numerous inequalities and pressures , especially among vulnerable groups .
these debates will lead to the preparation of a fully fledged commission position in autumn 20finally , I would like to thank all honourable members for their questions and suggestions .
i would ask my fellow members to put their trust in me with regard to the following process .
we will take your suggestion into account .
having said that , we are not questioning in any way whatsoever what has been agreed .
next time , there will not be such complications , because the treaty of lisbon will be in force .
mr brok , will you please leave the chamber and have your discussion outside .
we need seriously to end this now .
i shall abstain for the same reasons .
without it , this news would unfortunately be nothing other than a publicity stunt .
only yesterday , parliament was voting for aid to be granted under the european globalisation adjustment fund .
in writing . I welcome the outcome of this vote on the 2010 budget .
transparency is important and its importance is growing in the age of globalisation .
it is our common philosophical heritage and safeguards the principle of civil peace around which the eu was built .
i hope the resolution on belarus is one of many steps we will take .
applause 
es mr president , I would like to emphasise what mr meyer has said .
we have two further important points .
es mr president , this is indeed a point of order .
luckily nothing happened , but it marked the beginning of increasing homophobia in uganda .
this principle is not open to debate .
however , due to the reasons we already know , I cannot .
uganda has ratified these conventions .
however , currently , these are all under serious threat with the present regime .
freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of democracy .
for over five years , I have been a member of the eu southern caucasus parliamentary cooperation committees .
azerbaijan will also benefit from assistance under the european initiative for democracy and human rights .
this will constitute an important and additional forum for communicating our messages .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
the next item is voting time .
texts of agreements forwarded by the council see minutes
after detroit , to give you an example , the spotlight is on body scanners as the best solution .
can we , with a clear conscience , deport people who have been the victims of racial persecution ?
i would like to thank france and portugal for their cooperation in the fight against eta .
fr mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the gaza strip is being threatened with strangulation .
however , since the alde group has probably not had enough speeches , the last speaker is mr gallagher .
this is what we believe we are delivering .
that will also be addressed within the framework of the eu institutions .
these are the problems that are swaying the balance between life and death for haitians .
in all the frayed work to alleviate the suffering and chaos , clear leadership and coordinated assistance are needed .
applause 
within a matter of days , the united states has assumed a dominant role in rescue and coordination matters .
in addition , we should think about what could be done better .
as for the others , they will join us when they realise that this is the future .
why ?
twenty one member states were mobilised to respond .
he advocated the creation of a humanitarian rapid reaction force .
we work through the united nations the general assembly adopted a resolution condemning the situation only last month .
we must , however , keep the communication channels to the outside world open .
the eu should redouble its efforts to expedite that process in every way possible .
they risk life imprisonment or worse , simply because their religion is different from that of the ruling power .
on the contrary , iran's long history shows us this .
i would urge you to continue with the dialogue .
an inclusive internal political consensus on the way forward remains elusive .
we would pay the price ourselves .
indeed , citizens have the right to demand faultless monitoring of the terrorist threat .
maybe you can also help to get them freed .
madam president , we debated earlier the deteriorating human rights situation and brutal fascist regime in iran .
the vote will take place during the first part session in february .
these interests are increasingly being defended by military means , and with ever greater aggressiveness .
we are also developing our relations with iraq .
there are , indeed , positive signs .
i would appreciate a response from you .
baroness ashton , I am sorry but I do not share your optimism .
i think the eu should , in particular , help with the rebuilding of babylon .
that point was well made .
how long ?
how can we eradicate poverty without making food sovereignty a priority ?
in this emerging setting , a reduction in plenary jpa meetings would make sense .
i am greatly pleased by the commissioner's declaration that the european commission has no such intentions .
there are myriad mechanisms that currently ensure that many of these countries remain subject to domination and subjugation .
there were some questions on fiscal matters .
that was with regard to the council during the swedish presidency .
this is a fundamental step in the creation of european legislation on minimum procedural rights .
they pour shame on the inaction of governments in council .
the authors of this oral question are right they require europe's urgent attention .
though I am ashamed , I have to agree with them because I myself have had similar experiences .
the common procedures are about lowering european legal standards and not raising them .
the commission will endeavour to have all the measures planned in the roadmap adopted as soon as possible .
we absolutely agree that this is the right approach .
their rights and their future must be top priority .
in addition , there are two other matters .
we really owe it to all the victims .
the victims of human trafficking are the most vulnerable and defenceless people , and they need our protection .
they must be offered residence permits .
very often , we do not want to see it .
the victims do not receive appropriate assistance , shelter or compensation .
as you said , minister , political will does exist in the european parliament .
written statements rule 149 
it is very important to make a distinction between the two .
however , I am confident in the capacities of europe .
thank you , mr barroso .
the lisbon strategy failed due to the reluctance of the member states to keep their own promises .
it must be a good omen , though !
it is either one thing or the other .
there was scarcely room for mr obama even .
such common ground can be found , in my view , in the emissions trading mechanism .
they are damaging !
mr schulz , thank you for your words .
also , it works .
now , I believe that the answer lies in the treaty of lisbon .
the measure of a good presidency is not conventional speeches or great words , or common places .
that is illustrative of the importance which it ascribes to consumer protection .
help him to secure the stability and growth pact .
mr zapatero , with regard to the social pact in particular , you have our full support .
finally , in contrast to your fellow european members represented here , spain still refuses to recognise kosovo .
these really are challenges which again require more common resources and better political coherence .
that is a good thing .
i would like subsequent presidencies to have to measure themselves against you where cooperation structures are concerned .
what the citizens of the european union really need is jobs .
you made many wonderful comments about european citizenship and fairness and honesty .
mr president , one of the changes the prime minister spoke of this morning is the citizensinitiative .
specifically , there are no concrete measure to combat unemployment .
welcome
one example is the canary islands and the people who live there .
i wish to ask you , what are european interests ?
this will not occur in any other area or region of the world .
applause 
however , it lacked a clear reference to the problem of huge deficits .
however , will the newly appointed high representative for foreign affairs and security policy do this ?
firstly , because one of the priorities of the spanish presidency is energy security .
i understand and support this .
this is what will be produced on 25 january .
no response to the conditions laid down by parliament has been received .
only one mep was present in brussels . that mep happened to be me .
it is as simple as that .
this is no small task we are facing .
i wonder if mr bloom would like to tell the house the difference between climate and weather .
the world today is determined by economic fundamentalism .
the us and china together account for almost half .
however , china and the us are opting for a different route .
firstly , we should take the lead as regards committing ourselves to reduction targets .
we cannothalf committo investment in renewable energy sources and low carbon transport .
europe should , therefore , reconsider the organisational aspects of such conferences .
after copenhagen , we cannot behave and we cannot do politics the same way as we did before copenhagen .
es I would like to welcome mrs espinosa I am very pleased that she is here .
i share your hope that , in mexico our second chance we shall do better .
in this way , we would achieve equal contributions from each member state , without unnecessary complications .
the eu has the interest and capability to push this kind of change through in the un system .
let us continue to put our own house in order .
i can only say that it is time the eu woke up to reality .
question time council 
subject eu integration of kosovo
i think you are off to a very good start this week .
this is particularly the case in 2010 , which is the year for combating poverty and social exclusion .
in the treaties of the european union , there is a clear division of competences .
in modern europe , quite simply , they are not .
eighteen months ago , the governing justice and development party akp narrowly escaped the same fate .
the progress reports on turkey presented to the european parliament are the result of the balances between these forces .
elected representatives are being persecuted and jailed en masse .
today's debate has focused largely on the party closure and rightly so .
pacta sunt servanda that is always emphasised in connection with turkey , and rightly so .
it is also particularly important that we involve the municipalities , towns , districts and the citizens in this .
member states are stakeholders in this and will submit proposals on this by the end of the month .
what we already agree upon rather are principles and things that go without saying .
the danube strategy is evidence that the danube is indeed a supra national river .
these are questions to which we must find an answer as quickly as possible .
so , in conclusion , I would like to thank you for your support for the danube strategy .
let us work together .
why is the tunisian government taking so long to respond to the un report ?
but look at what tunisia did .
mrs kroes said that we are talking about integrating the tunisian economy into the single market .
three men have been taken into custody , but , generally speaking , the violence against christians is tolerated .
this is an outrageous disgrace !
the place of anti christian communism has today been taken principally by militant islam .
it is this respect that is missing in the resolution .
the relationship that the european union is able to maintain with china is of particular importance .
the fact is , the human rights situation in china is unacceptable .
however , that fact should not stop us from raising these issues in parliament .
at the same time , google is visibly calling for freedom of speech for chinese internet users .
there has been criticism regarding their policy in china over the years , questioning the motto .
apparently , google will be less evil in the future .
we expect the same today .
since that day , neither his family nor his loved ones have had any news of him .
oral explanations of vote
i am voting in favour of the motion for a resolution presented here .
the idea of establishing functional regions macro regions began with the baltic sea region strategy .
written declarations included in the register rule 123 see minutes
mr president , we believe that the item on madagascar is not particularly important today .
in accordance with your proposal , I will analyse the problem thoroughly and make a statement on this .
one minute speeches on matters of political importance
it is , indeed , a tragic case .
how is the eu protecting the most vulnerable groups ?
the new directive represents a qualitative and quantitative leap forward in this respect .
the interest of europe as a whole must take precedence over partial viewpoints .
thank you .
we may criticise the tax burden in our own countries .
thank you and good luck .
we have to work together to fight tax fraud and dubious tax havens .
this directive is an essential statement of our intention to do that .
tax fraud and evasion result in poorer gdp results to the tune of around eur 200 billion a year .
i call on colleagues to bear this in mind when making proposals on this matter .
the detection of fiscal and social fraud is complex even in the internal market .
gm / opel current developments debate 
there is just one item on the agenda the enhancement of european economic cooperation .
the chemical industry has to contend with european climate policy .
radical change is now required .
i should like to conclude by addressing a few words to the representatives of the belgian parties in office .
or are these not concepts that can be used in the context of the economy ?
this has met with a dubious reception from public opinion .
the commission shares the rapporteur's view that it is essential to continue with our efforts .
the commission has noted the interesting ideas contained in the european parliament's resolution .
the majority of the almost 80 million people living in poverty in europe are women and children .
at the same time , consideration must always be given to maintaining the balance between career and family obligations .
i welcome this report and applaud the emphasis that mr tarabella puts on the economic well being of women .
it is the economy that is coming up with all the solutions .
we need to create the conditions for that to become a reality .
domestic violence is a horrible reality many women are indeed murdered in their own homes .
women must not be in the role of supplicants .
one final example companies whose management consists of at least 30 % women achieve better business success .
the fact is , the european machine is obviously still in need of some adjustments .
that is also an enormous step forward in the cooperation between our two institutions .
calm down , my friend , calm down !
what initiative did the commission come up with to address the crisis in greece ?
applause 
they provide no basis for the work to successfully combat poverty and social exclusion in europe .
if you go on pushing your extreme euro nationalism , this will lead to violence .
ladies and gentlemen , honourable members of parliament , we all have work to do in this regard .
the close collaboration of these institutions is necessary in order to achieve results .
we do not think that the treaty of lisbon is the most important thing .
the responsibilities have been divided up .
i do not yet know how I will vote later .
the commission has to take into account the differences , opportunities and means of each member state .
the citizens have expectations you spoke of being bold with regard to the european agenda .
the candidatesanswers were often agreed in advance , and were couched in indecently general terms .
my best wishes , president barroso !
it furthermore rules out the sui generis construct .
you have undertaken to make this transparent and to act in a cooperative manner .
i am looking at your vice president , lady ashton .
it is important not to reduce the significance of the presidency held by individual member states .
is it going to be one of the commissioners ?
since its creation with 11 participants , the euro area has grown to comprise 16 member states .
the euro area has been an area of stability and job creation .
in fact , many of you have urged the commission to keep a strong accent on collegiality .
it is very important to relaunch the internal market now .
without an internal market , we will not have a strong european union .
applause 
the ppe group expects the commission to work effectively on all these fronts , at the same time .
in mr barroso , we have the right leader to take the commission forward .
then they gave 27 people total unlimited power .
instead , we need more democracy .
explanations of vote
the president cut off the speaker 
fr mr president , baroness ashton and her federalist friends treat us as anti europeans .
written explanations of vote
furthermore , our ideologies are completely different .
he also promised to come back with a regulation for resolving the problems as soon as possible .
the outcome of the negotiations between the commission and parliament is also satisfactory .
it is currently merely a european parliament wish list , with no obligation .
however , the interinstitutional agreement does contain some important steps in the right direction .
i shall therefore vote against a commission that is the antithesis of this .
economic recovery will largely come as a result of changing our energy model .
the future of the economy is the future of the green economy .
while some of the nominated commissioners are competent , others are not .
they should be given the opportunity , as they wish , to familiarise themselves with europe's challenges .
plans for the later years of the programme are less detailed at this stage .
the measures and policy intentions outlined in this programme are an important step in the right direction .
each report will be subject to a commission assessment .
admittedly it is months too late , but it is absolutely necessary .
i wish him courage and luck for the important tasks he is taking on .
however , they should not form this basis alone .
to make up this deficit , washington has to borrow each day more than usd 5 billion .
instead , they take the opportunity to seize greater control while you are on your knees .
the union shall take measures to ensure coordination of the employment policies . 
this was not just a statistical correction .
the existence of this detention centre is a serious problem , of course , for transatlantic relations .
europe must do more as well .
there are numerous reports of the murder and of the most dreadful abuse and humiliation of the detainees .
in essence , however , we first need to clarify three points .
key objectives for the conference of the parties to the cites debate 
i now come to the controversial issue .
that is behind parliament's resolution concerning polar bears , elephants , tigers , big asian cats and sharks .
this is crucial for the survival of this species .
that is certainly not a sensible way to proceed .
i therefore propose that this identity marking be taken to doha as a useful contribution to the debate .
it is no different than asking to close down the whole salmon industry in scotland in one swipe .
i firmly believe , however , that mere physical investment in infrastructure will not solve the problems of ghettos .
this is an eminently european issue .
the new text stipulates a rate of 4 % .
i therefore welcome the fact that the eu is looking for ways to help these people .
the vote will take place on thursday at 12 noon .
the agreement was signed on 4 november in stockholm and ratified by the croatian parliament on 20 november .
this is what the european union believes and will continue to believe .
it achieved visa liberalisation , and the commission could recommend starting accession negotiations .
applause 
well done for this initiative !
on cyprus , I attempted to reach a clear and broad based compromise with the shadow rapporteurs .
i think there was good cooperation in the process and I thank my colleagues .
i count on your support .
this momentum is diminishing day by day .
we do not feel that turkey's membership is either realistic or opportune for many reasons .
let us take the example of the armed forces .
this is a good thing .
see the last report of the un high commissioner for refugees .
that is the path turkey is taking at the moment .
de madam president , firstly , congratulations to mr füle on his appointment as commissioner .
turkey has indeed made good progress , but many points of concern must be addressed urgently .
accession to the union is the only option to stabilise the region .
turkey needs to honour all its contractual obligations , as all previous candidate countries have done .
however , we cannot have à la carte accession tailored to turkey .
madam president , I welcome commissioner füle and I would like to congratulate the authors for three well balanced reports .
there is still work to be done in this area and some difficulties remain .
let us be fair , let us be correct and let us be credible .
can I ask mrs flautre a question ?
in any case , madam president , the presidency's position on negotiations with turkey is absolutely clear .
some members have the habit of not reading out the number for roll call votes .
de mr president , this has been discussed with the groups .
i shall be brief .
2009 progress report on croatia 
to these sums can also be added the more than eur 92 million already pledged by individual member states .
mr president , friday will mark one month since the devastating earthquake in haiti .
in any case , we must be clear and defend european values even in our relations with the iranians .
europe must take more decisive action to restrict this shameful procedure .
our group does not disagree with the observation that women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights .
and yet , this principle has not been enshrined in the arbitration agreement .
meanwhile , subject a does not pay vat , as he is not the end seller .
on the other hand , as after the asian tsunami , we need to draw lessons from what happened .
mr president , I endorsed adoption of the resolution on human trafficking .
reduction targets must be measurable , significant and verifiable for everyone if there is to be climate justice .
in writing . using ccctb to combat double taxation is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut .
such statements must , however , be followed by the conclusion of legally binding agreements .
in addition , the religious and moral aspects are an important element .
these must have supporting data and substantiated scientific opinions .
after a period of deadlock lasting more than nine months , accession negotiations resumed in october 200the report also notes a number of issues affecting the process of croatia's integration into the european union .
i voted in favour of it , because croatia should become a member state in the near future .
yet turkey is a friendly nation , with a very rich history and culture .
turkey must understand that it cannot change its past .
at the same time , we realise how important the swift agreement is for completely different reasons .
these are just some of the examples judge bruguière cites in his report .
secondly , we strongly support security for our citizens and also citizensrights and data protection .
under the terms of the homeland security act , data can be stored for up to 90 years .
it is a pleasure to see you here .
the member states are allowing other governments to spy on our citizens indirectly via the eu .
this balance must be reflected in the agreement that we are currently debating .
show us how effective these measures are using open documents , not secret ones .
ro the council sent the agreement to the european parliament very late , which is extraordinary .
i hope that there will be no more recurrences of incidents of this nature .
therefore , we are debating an interim agreement today which improves the current situation .
the netherlands and belgium cannot end up being thedupeof all this .
terrorism has to be well organised to survive , and for this it principally needs money .
there are five conclusions .
i will do so this year .
this is another thought for the future .
what is more , the scanners are also user friendly .
mr president , back to body scanners .
the first is cosi , the standing committee on internal security .
those of us who value peace , freedom and democracy ought to be concerned about terrorism because it works .
ladies and gentlemen , we now come to catch the eye .
how will protection of the images of people who are scanned be guaranteed ?
civil liberty groups have the duty to weigh all new measures being advocated .
for it is difficult to suppose that terrorists will agree to being scanned .
most importantly , it demonstrates ukraine's attachment to european values .
elections have winners and losers .
it is logical and legitimate that any possible problems are investigated .
it still has its multi party system , and this is mainly thanks to the orange revolution .
we cannot simply let things go on as they have before .
this will remain the eu's responsibility .
question time council 
the council has investigated these cases and has brought them to the attention of the chinese authorities .
what strategy does the commission intend to pursue to mitigate such global imbalances in its trade policy ?
however , no trade war came about .
that would amount to considered action and leadership on our part .
this is the other side of the coin .
this crisis of world capitalism is enormously exacerbated by the activities of the financial speculators on the world markets .
for the acp countries , for example , trade in goods represents 50 % of their trade .
we must fight against any protectionist tendencies .
therefore , I call on the commission to develop a new strategy for world trade .
the commission has assured us that korea is actively liberalising its import regime .
the fta is currently being translated .
the economic benefits of the fta are mostly in the eu's favour .
to protect our industry against import increases causing or threatening injury , the fta contains an effective safeguard mechanism .
mr caspary also made this point .
we have heard them here tonight about the car industry .
these complaints give rise to questions that continue to go unanswered .
we have had three commissioners on international trade , two eu council presidents and the lisbon treaty .
this is the first major fta .
we did not think that events would prove us right so quickly .
they keep signalling to me to tell me that they cannot keep up with you .
mr de gucht , perhaps you could explain the safeguard clauses to me in simple terms .
i would particularly like to know who can trigger them and when .
the risks of infection following an accident are not insignificant .
i congratulate commissioner andor .
sometimes we say that europe needs to get closer to its citizens .
that is why prevention , healthcare and job security are essential .
thank you , commissioner .
that cannot be right .
commissioner , that is the context of this question .
you simply have to face this fact .
we are striving to ensure that communications between people are as open as possible .
there is no responsible or immediate management present to ensure that the gambler is of age and acting legally .
there are two internationally recognised scales which can measure problem gambling .
i confirm that the commission does not rule out solutions other than infringement procedures .
thank you very much , commissioner , for that full and encouraging reply .
the commission will then immediately launch negotiations with the us to try to conclude them as soon as possible .
my goal is to achieve a new agreement with very ambitious safeguards for privacy and data protection .
the next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on venezuela .
i wish that they were only administrative problems and the rights of these media bodies would be restored .
the pegging of the national currency to the us dollar was probably another counterproductive move .
as europeans , we must have the courage to speak out against such practices .
unfortunately , certain people do not believe in this yet .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
as a result , the country's cable providers stopped broadcasting seven channels .
the debate is closed .
the reduction in funds which are destined for this area and for these refugees is of great concern .
not long ago I myself spoke about it .
hu the military junta has promised free , democratic elections for 20this may put an end to the recurring ethnic conflicts .
the eu has several times issued declarations condemning violations of human rights .
that concludes voting time .
there is no doubt that we are in favour of debate .
i was glad to find such a level of ambition around the table .
our social market economy must be hardwired to seize the opportunities of the future .
however , because it is still divided , europe is unable to punch its full weight .
can we tolerate this any more ?
is that what you are advocating ?
there is the excessive public sector , for example .
as an integrated strategy , it is , in principle , not bad , but .
even before the recent crisis , the economies of europe were losing ground to our major rivals and competitors .
the internal market needs to be reinvigorated and extended to new fields .
mr president , in times of need , you discover who your friends are , as the saying goes .
the same work in the same place must receive the same wage .
mr farage , I am sorry but it was not a personal statement .
an eu 2020 strategy focused on innovation in areas of existing expertise .
fr presidents , after the lisbon strategy , we now have the 2020 strategy .
we should be looking at 40 % by 20of course , the issue is not only about climate but also about resource availability and increasing resource efficiency .
you are a man of great quality .
i would like to ask him to reconsider his approach to the issue of parliamentary questions .
i will explain .
we did not do what was done in the 1930s , namely restore budgetary equilibrium as quickly as possible .
however , we have not lapsed back into the protectionism of the 1930s .
in fact , every crisis is a challenge .
iran has signalled that it might run in the elections for a place on the council .
clearly , therefore , this body has little substantive moral authority .
however , it should take a critical look at itself .
the next item is the council and commission statements on the implementation of goldstone recommendations on israel / palestine .
a population was thrown into panic , trapped and unable to escape .
the destruction remains and the siege continues .
this policy is harmful to the people of israel and therefore to peace in the middle east .
unfortunately , mr goldstone has not seen fit to investigate whether this actually was the case .
it is that simple it just needs to be applied .
while it makes far reaching demands of israel , it says little about hamas .
how is this possible ?
minority rights as part of human rights cannot be considered an internal matter .
let us await its report , and only then will we decide on further action .
she then transformed the building into a vibrant cultural and social centre for the polish minority .
i entirely agree with the ppe group that paragraph 9 is central .
we will do it together .
gender equality policy cannot and must not be a subject for voting on and for narrow , enforced majorities .
their needs are largely unknown and ignored and their voices are not heard .
access to these rights is a particular problem , since legal redress is often extremely expensive and complicated .
it should therefore be justified to ask why we are always talking about it .
i make a call to all the men in this parliament .
it is my belief that the european union will welcome this major agreement .
ro last week , I attended the meeting of the european union moldova parliamentary cooperation committee .
this is a clear case of unfair competition .
it is opening the window to the acquisition of european nationality to an indeterminate number of illegal immigrants .
we therefore used this criterion to distribute the speeches equally .
financial resources and the required swiftness of operation are necessary for this purpose .
the planet is sending us an sos message .
this data needs to be aggregated at national and regional level .
in my opinion , there are two layers to this proposal .
the significance of energy security is repeated in a variety of documents , debates and meetings .
this regulation will provide the european commission with information about energy structures so that it can obtain an overview .
this includes data about oil and natural gas infrastructures , as well as for renewable energy sources .
various gas pipelines , off shore wind parks and power stations by the dozen are at the drawing board stage .
if europe is to confront these problems , it must have effective and complex instruments at its disposal .
this is going to be a difficult decision for members tomorrow .
it is always controversial when you are asked to give yourselves resources .
this budgetary amendment provides a response to a real need .
as you all know , the last reform in 2002 was not sufficiently successful .
i will try , if at all possible , to make sure that meetings do not clash in future .
but the problem is how waters are being fished , not by whom .
indiscriminate trawling and longline fishing empty our seas of marine life .
i am in favour of fundamental reform of the common fisheries policy .
all the important things have already been said .
it must accentuate the social dimension , give priority to the ecosystem and be integrated in the marine policy .
the management policy based on tacs and quotas must leave room for effort based management .
tourism also plays an important role in this respect .
these are our priorities .
the system is known as ertms european rail traffic management system .
after disasters of this kind , people's first response is often to find someone to blame .
who has suffered because of them ?
this was not the first time that a train has passed a red signal .
transport ten t networks again we will discuss it soon .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
mr president , this is only a factual correction .
we have seen since the 1970s where that process leads .
lt I greatly welcome the decision adopted on new rules in the fishing sector .
despite the current economic crisis , neoliberal dogmas continue to underpin many eu policies .
no minority must be overlooked .
the high electoral turnout is particularly worthy of note .
for the consequences of bilateral relations between ukraine and russia also concern eu member states .
its agenda includes the economic and financial crisis and the united nations declaration on human rights education and training .
this justifies an increase in staff for parliament's and the groupssecretariats in these committees .
measures to replace / improve vessels have only benefited large companies .
fishing communities are currently undergoing a difficult period , marked by severe deterioration in fish stocks .
wednesday , 10 march marks the 51st anniversary of the popular uprising in tibet .
where is this procedure now ?
nowadays , it is not only a matter of giving flowers to women we know .
mr president , as you have said , today is international women's day .
we can provide educational opportunities and employment , but the pay gap still remains .
is this not violence ?
i am delighted to see that commissioner rehn is moving in that direction .
essentially , mr chávez is cooperating with eta criminals .
for example , in colombia , assassinations of trade unionists continue to happen practically on a daily basis .
i believe it is important that the commission and the presidency proceed with more caution .
this saw ethnic cleansing carried out also in the name of bandera .
the rights must be tailored to eu standards and the ilo conventions .
likewise , nobody forced us to hesitate and falter when the so calledperipheraleconomies come under attack .
i am very pleased that we have this agreement .
they wanted to take them to ferret exhibitions across europe .
it will be necessary to take measures in this area .
we need transparent systems .
it also sets out consumersrights and the responsibilities of distributors and tourism service providers .
we need clarification , we need certainty , and we need protection for the consumer .
such a situation is not good either for consumers or for business .
however , there are also other ways that taxation could be raised within financial services .
are these truly complementary ?
it is a shame though that our government has not been able to do that .
it will not even hinder what are sometimes called speculative investments .
nonetheless , in my opinion , any such measure should not simply be considered a temporary measure .
these countries are now being forced to borrow from the same banks , thereby paying them twice .
we must be clear .
i would say yes , but what for ?
no longer is the proposal being advocated just by academics and minority or opposition groups .
an expiry date would indeed have several positive effects .
that is another reason why I am calling for the proposal on micro entities to be adopted quickly .
what is the outcome of this situation ?
we were promised these proposals for 20only seven per cent of the micro entities that we are talking about are involved in cross border activities .
micro entities , moreover , cannot afford this effort at all .
this global review I have told you , early 2011 will take time .
my sixth comment relates to the position of business associations .
parliament has reminded us of its wish to see competition policy operating within the framework of the codecision procedure .
mr president , the rapporteur referred to cartels .
in 2008 , that was not a problem .
by mr buşoi , on behalf of the committee on the internal market and consumer protection , on solvit .
the transposition deficit has fallen to 0.7 % , so significantly lower than the target set .
providing solvit with additional staff obviously incurs some costs as well .
we are talking about the internal market .
one element of this strategy relates to the handling of collective claims .
it gives the impression that the only important thing is how the market is functioning .
we need more instruments that make it clear that citizens are protected in the internal market .
moreover , parents also have control over their children's consumption , especially when they are young .
that must be dealt with .
that needs to be looked at so that there is proper staffing .
the report contains some of these solutions , while others have been raised for discussion in this debate .
zocor 20 mg
schengen stands for freedom of movement .
it is essential for this to occur in order to avoid an omission in the law .
a lot of concerns were voiced .
responses to this disaster also need to be more than mere palliatives .
further development of the confidential database on consumer problems is essential for the identification of markets .
the scoreboards clearly show which markets are not sufficiently meeting the needs of consumers .
in addition , I hope they will supply us with yet more detailed information than before .
the report we adopted today clearly describes the benefits of this instrument .
your examples are misleading .
it is therefore imperative that member states transpose internal market legislation into national law in a timely manner .
despite their obligations , member states are delaying transposition and are also carrying out transposition incorrectly .
mr almunia was the competent commissioner .
this issue of the greek accounts was addressed several times in euro area meetings .
that in itself is an enormous change from recent years .
we have seen your protest .
it is not justified to buy insurance and buy unseen interventions on a risk on a purely speculative basis .
everything takes place behind closed doors here everything is swept under the carpet .
this relates to what the first speaker was saying about eritrea .
it was negotiated and we have an intergovernmental treaty that recognises this .
president barroso , are you prepared to give an answer ?
every project that does not take this into account is doomed to failure .
that is new , I think .
where will our growth come from in the future ?
i have two questions , commissioner one is on the quick start money .
it needs a lot of concrete work .
modern flats have been built and given to them , the same which other people have to buy .
the most proactive and open mayors are therefore facing enormous difficulties .
finally , this is not simply a budgetary issue and it does not depend merely on resources .
this is why I support the strategy of the union .
what we must avoid doing is creating a strategy which exists only on paper .
hu mr president , we have a technical problem .
thank you .
the objective now is to reduce poverty by a quarter by 20these elements are all present in the eu 2020 strategy .
of these , 34 % of people living in poverty are unemployed and 14 % are working poor .
subject evaluation of the culture programme 2007 2013
the commission is currently working on the european road safety strategy for the next decade .
the commission , of course , will closely follow their proper implementation by the member states .
pl mr kallas , I think we should draw conclusions from this tragedy .
it can become more complicated .
that concludes question time .
yet here he is , hiding in the eu , away from his faithful supporters .
he is calling for privatisation .
he is , in fact , thefat controller, creating fat pay packets for fat cats .
i believe that this review is long overdue .
lay the negotiation documents on the table straight away .
will there be criminal sanctions ?
i strongly disagree with their approach but I cannot unilaterally breach a confidentiality commitment .
however , we know that this is where the heart of european union competitiveness resides .
let us work together to find this balance between rights and responsibilities .
i want to have all the documents on the table now , and for all citizens .
europe has always been the continent where people's freedom to accumulate knowledge takes pride of place .
this freedom would now be under serious threat , which cannot and must not happen .
are they there to safeguard their commercial interests ?
this is where the importance of the pvv becomes clear .
what have you done since then ?
now that we have the treaty of lisbon in place , that is no longer possible .
so it is a little bit difficult then to question me as to what this is all about .
last but not least , I disagree with what has been said by some colleagues on colombia .
opening of the sitting
it is a time to be smart and ambitious .
economic weight is translating into political clout and self confidence .
and yes , there is a tendency in europe to put process ahead of outcomes .
we should not lower our ambitions but , rather , give ourselves the means to realise them .
in a way , the balkans is the birthplace of eu foreign policy .
it is a serious issue that needs a serious debate .
the dual track approach and the preparation of smart targeted sanctions by the un security council are warranted .
this week , we celebrated 8 march .
we do not agree with having united states military bases in the european union .
it is not about operating above the heads of member states .
it would be wrong to take excessively quick and thus wrong decisions .
today marks 100 days since the treaty of lisbon entered into force .
catherine ashton gives us a graphic description of the eu as a rising power from a declining continent .
de the new report , like the albertini report , supports a union training mission in somalia .
for me , that is excessive we are biting off more than we can chew here .
you agree with us that peace building is important , but will you anchor it in the external action service ?
a trend that can also be observed in candidate countries like turkey .
but we in ukip were on to this from the start .
that would get you to the moon , and most people now would like you to stay there .
de mr president , madam vice president , today you are sitting on the other side .
there is no going back , either for you or for us .
on the operational headquarters it is not that I have changed my position .
the european institutions must come to an understanding on the eeas .
applause 
single euro payments area vote 
this is why we voted against .
he strongly encourages the european commission to establish a public and transparent dialogue on acta .
simplifying the accounting obligations for smes , and particularly for the smallest ones , remains an urgent requirement .
let us hope that the eu 2020 strategy will provide it .
the myriad good intentions are matched only by the absence of new instruments with which to implement them .
the greek crisis serves to reveal our lack of solidarity .
this strategy must generate the creation of jobs .
in this context , the objective of european territorial cohesion can be seen to be fundamental .
i hope the process of lasting peace through a two state solution will be supported by the goldstone findings .
parliament is calling on the commission to finally take up the issue and to work on an implementation project .
public administrationsmigration to sepa is below our expectations .
it is a catastrophic violation of individual private property .
regrettably , the commission's information policy in relation to the negotiations leaves a lot to be desired .
europe is divided on this issue .
the militarisation of international relations and internal security on the basis of the aforementioned fight against terrorism 
i am delighted that the european parliament has clearly adopted the report on the non proliferation of nuclear weapons .
neither the uk nor france , nor indeed the us , now produce fissile material for weapons .
the eu will certainly not be planting its flag on the seabed , as the russians have done .
mr president , there are many good reasons for discussing the arctic .
however , we already know all this .
above all , it is necessary to deal with the unregulated legal status of the arctic region .
written statements rule 149 
applause 
as is the case for any prisoner , the state was responsible for his safety and for his life .
what is happening with the persecution in the western sahara ?
no ! we will not be part of this hypocrisy .
we know there are different ways to freedom for people oppressed by dictators .
the major democratic states and the eu should , of course , support this .
at the same time , constructive dialogues that started in 2008 are also giving positive signs .
those relations or any problems that there may be are settled in the independent courts of the spanish state .
this is the aim of the initiative presented by 12 european union governments .
we have the feeling that developments in this regard are going backwards rather than forwards .
i will now set out the main elements of the draft conclusions .
the only way out is to set clear priorities .
in some cases there are appalling stories of late payments by the eu itself .
in copenhagen , hungary and poland agreed to use these sums for green infrastructures .
the first is nuclear just the word , merely broaching the subject , frightens us .
what undertakings are there from the member states ?
the next issue is the sources of finance and the road maps .
you know that , during my previous mandate , I fought very hard for a european research area .
global climate warming caused by human activity is a fact .
fifty three people died , a dozen people are unaccounted for , and hundreds of people have lost their homes .
this is damage on a significant scale .
the european union must show its solidarity , but it must also demonstrate a sense of responsibility .
however , I must make a severe criticism of the european union solidarity fund .
the frequency and intensity of disastrous events is clearly increasing , and this is worrying .
as soon as news of the earthquake broke , echo's emergency response system was mobilised .
therefore we join with today's parliament motions calling for his release .
this situation needs to be amended as soon as possible .
we have to understand that without international involvement , mexico will not win the war .
therefore we cannot share the concerns of the mexican authorities , the agents of which regularly violate human rights .
the violence in mexico is linked to drug trafficking and the social inequalities made worse by the economic crisis .
they are the same people who are fighting to defend the rule of law and democracy .
if the president of the country declares war in this area , he should be given complete support .
fi mr president , I wish to highlight two issues in our resolution on mexico .
this barbaric punishment by execution has no place in the modern world .
i hope this decision will not affect the number of sentences passed .
this is now the second ruling of the court with the same content .
morality , deterrence and fairness are key in the debate on the death penalty .
voting time
we had originally agreed to put it on the agenda on the assumption that everything was in order .
for those tasks , the fresh and forceful backing of the european parliament is of great importance .
in other words , yes , europe must show solidarity with greece .
if we do not want to see a large scale conflagration , we need now to demonstrate solidarity with greece .
leading the union means seeking a solution for greece .
el madam president , I think we have dealt sufficiently and fairly with the issue of greece .
in the final analysis , it is humiliating to have to resort to slogans .
how much of the structural funds ?
nobody has asked for money to be put on the table .
we must put an end to this now , and hopefully we shall do so tomorrow .
we have seen the results .
these are not the leadership skills that we need in the european union .
that is why I am in favour of this major , strong currency .
today , the debate revolves around greece tomorrow it will probably concern another member state .
both are needed when you belong to a family such as a euro area .
the greek people are paying a heavy price .
we must now acknowledge that that was a major mistake .
a single currency for such a large , economically heterogeneous region of the world is self evidently problematic .
this would be an unrealistic target for a number of european states .
this is a time that requires solidarity between the member states and europe's institutions .
it is to be hoped that the upcoming european council will take steps towards achieving integrated and coordinated solidarity .
the economic and financial crisis , and greece , require european action .
a detailed examination of the operation of the credit default swaps market is needed .
for that reason , particular attention must be given to the drawing up of the 2020 strategy .
in my view , however , nuclear power is little suited to leading europe into a sustainable energy future .
let us tackle what the citizens are asking us head on .
we must find the optimal solution the appropriate balance between different rules and common requirements .
parliament should work together with the commission to evaluate and give opinions on initiatives which are submitted .
it is extremely important that the treaties are complied with .
generally speaking , it is a fact that democracy is today taking a backwards step .
secondly , I would like to point out that what we are doing here is just a first step .
europe as a whole has become even less of a single people than it might otherwise have been .
mr kamall is not here .
i hope that we will find the right balance on how to keep this admissibility check in adequate proportion .
the eu position does not leave any room for misinterpretation .
from our side , I can guarantee the eu's wholehearted support to such a process .
a month ago , I went to dharamsala and I met the dalai lama .
reference was also made here to the fact that we need a special representative for tibet .
this is embarrassing .
since that time , tibetans have not been allowed to commemorate that day freely .
in eastern europe , where I come from , the story is a familiar one .
however , what we are talking about here is more than that .
would it not be better to improve the services provided in biarritz by introducing non polluting forms of transport ?
you see , this is the genius of the eu it is always one person removed .
we are fighting with all the workers to create .
after all , staffing in all the union's institutions is managed according to this principle .
when the citizens of the union write to the commission , their letters must not go unanswered .
young people are already the driving force and future of europe .
we must protect the development cooperation budget , however hard that may be .
we cannot rise adequately to the daily challenges , or even to the annual challenges except with difficulty .
i would like to speak for a few more minutes about the cohesion policy .
as he knows , we will be doing that from september onwards .
my second point is about savings .
however , this can , certainly , be changed , but it requires significant outlays .
young people with degrees are increasingly affected by unemployment .
however , it is also vitally important to increase the funding for erasmus mundus grants .
however , I must point out that there are some elements of this report which I do not support .
regulations must be honestly implemented to a common standard .
therefore , let us focus on quality and not packaging units .
the focus on quality rather than quantity may entail long term benefits for many households .
this robs producers and processors of their entrepreneurial freedom and also narrows the choice for consumers .
you are right about that .
this is all very welcome .
a person is infected by tuberculosis somewhere in the world every second .
this underestimates the way in which it is spreading , especially in central and eastern europe .
the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation short presentation 
one common feature is the increase in the financing needs of many countries .
theladies in whiteare mothers and wives of imprisoned opposition activists .
to ensure such a role , we still need to improve the functioning of financial systems considerably further .
we in the euro area must not penalise the countries that export the most .
but if we just look at the expenditure side , we will not succeed .
hence , it is now in a strong position for recovery .
thank you , sir .
this should be an important criterion for future assessments of other measures taken by the central bank .
this , too , does not necessarily have a deficit trigger .
it is already crumbling before our eyes .
this is no longer a market economy , but a jungle economy .
pl mr president , I shall avoid the military language which the previous speaker used .
the economic situation in numerous countries is clearly negative .
financial assistance for greece should come primarily from the international monetary fund imf .
it is really up to the council now to make a move .
i would like to draw attention to one aspect of it .
welcome
we warmly welcome mr tabarki and the members of his delegation .
otherwise , the interpretation made by the house's services will defeat the whole object of the reform .
forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting see minutes
the causes of this situation are varied .
unfortunately , the economic crisis is not yet over , and we cannot ignore it .
this does not change the fact that abortion means killing an unborn child .
written explanations of vote
solidarity , because it is the raison d être of european integration and will be its future .
the crisis has ruthlessly laid bare the weaknesses of the common currency system .
a number of opinions were heard that opposed anypunishmentagainst mr fazakas .
tens of millions of eastern europeans still live a life troubled by the communist horrors .
the perpetrators of the communist indignity should not be part of a democratic order they tried to suppress .
they must start by introducing their children and young people into the european school system .
investing in young people is investing in the future .
today , the danish social democrats voted in favour of the priorities for the 2011 budget .
they must not result in dependency , which could have negative effects on growth , salaries and employment .
the most serious financial and economic crisis since the 1930s has hit europe hard .
traditional development aid has largely failed in its purpose .
we are still waiting for the results of these actions .
the two coming years will be difficult .
the right arrangements have been made to involve the imf , within the framework of the euro area .
in doing so , we will of course respect the distribution of competences as provided for in the treaties .
europe 2020 is not about one level acting at the expense of the other .
this will be crucial to resolving the crisis .
let us look , primarily , at greece .
what does the council then do to europe 2020 ?
mr van rompuy , you mentioned that this was your first formal european council meeting .
the third thing we need is a bolder 2020 strategy .
turning to the europe 2020 initiative , we welcome the first tentative steps taken by the council .
june this year is much too late .
we are talking about a matter of the greatest importance .
this is not a revolutionary idea , nor was it my idea .
we had a discussion on the same day about the crisis in greece and some other points .
you have our support , but this strategy does need to contain clear objectives on poverty .
the regional and local levels of european governance are important co owners of europe's future .
the commission needs to clarify the flow of information with greece .
this is an issue which is different from supporting greece .
i would like to answer telegraphically some of those questions .
should we discuss this within the task force ?
the summit had optimistic and promising significance .
documents received see minutes
it is nice for you to congratulate us for being here today .
one minute speeches on matters of political importance
thus , it was not a point of order .
we might disagree on some specific questions but our objectives are the same .
we will need to remind ourselves of this again and again .
there are some areas where further action is necessary .
we need to think that one through .
of course , this does not need to influence safety .
further development is also important for us .
this is a real burning issue for me , and I would expect you to answer it .
that has been achieved with the help of the commission and also with the member states and the industry .
we require the travel agents to inform orally and / or in writing passengers at the time of reservation .
this is unacceptable .
it is not about earnings and not about profits it is about security .
i would suggest that you place this sort of thing in between the reports .
i am talking about the more stringent measures , which should be financed by the member states .
she cannot be here today .
the level of these charges should correspond only to costs demonstrably incurred in securing the safety of passengers .
what is clear is that the ash cloud has only delayed the pilotsstrike which has been announced .
we should therefore not start too high .
second , I would like to address the council and make an appeal to them .
roads are the arteries of our economy .
that is something on which we all agree .
this means efficient , safe , secure and environmentally friendly maritime transport services .
maritime transport provides for high quality jobs in europe and fuels research and european industrial innovation .
mr van dalen , congratulations on this excellent report .
in other words , we must counteract the risk of deflagging .
i am sure we will have to come back to this at a later stage .
i should like to refer to three specific questions .
finally , the concept ofgreen ports, as some members have dubbed it .
i have placed particular emphasis on shipbuilding and maintenance of ships .
this issue resonates differently in the various european countries .
european legislation on this matter must be rigorously applied , as mrs paulsen's report recommends .
we have a policy that limits greenhouse gas emissions .
de mr president , I , too , would like to thank mr dorfmann for his report .
an important question is how to maintain agricultural production in less favoured areas .
firstly , we should ensure that the requirements made of the industry are proportionate to the risk assessed .
this will enable the farmers to spend more time on their core agricultural activities .
the remaining information will be given in the e mail , which will reach you before lunch at the latest .
quite a number of matters were decided .
disruption of air traffic in europe debate 
we were very happy that eurocontrol was cooperative .
concerning passengers , the most important thing is to get people back home or to their destinations .
we must take a lesson from this for the future .
ultimately , it does not matter under which rules planes are flying or under which rules they are crashing .
these policies have focused entirely on air transport .
however , a human life is worth much more than goods .
the individual countries made the right decision .
it is a good idea to list the various possibilities , but we need a european approach .
where would we be today if we had implemented the provisions of the so called delors plan ?
we must also put more emphasis on accommodation .
passenger safety must be our overriding concern .
one of the biggest problems facing the passengers today is the confusion .
currently in europe , it is not possible to buy a train ticket in a civilised manner .
we are dealing with exceptional circumstances here , of course .
let us therefore be consistent .
if one thing is clear , it is that our society is extremely vulnerable to crises of this kind .
we want passengers from europe to be transported safely .
if we are all able to convince our parties , the situation will improve in future .
we are being far too polite .
thank you very much .
first , the urgent issues we recently debated the results of the european council .
the concerns and well being of european citizens will remain at the heart of commission action .
if this continues to be the case in the future , then these sorts of debates are pointless .
unfortunately , I cannot say the same thing about my fellow members .
it goes without saying that we must consolidate our budgets .
my next point relates to the budgetary consolidation .
we are talking here about the european social model that we want and that we love .
you will be able to rely on us if you finally put this into practice .
we therefore strongly support the centre piece initiative of this commission the 2020 strategy .
the commission must be their ally , not their adversary .
however , we do not have to take a laissez faire approach to economic forces .
therefore , we must firstly focus particular attention on the problem of poverty facing those in work .
they have to be given at the meeting of the council in june .
the increase in the employment rate is closely linked to the eu's industrial policy .
coordination of humanitarian aid and reconstruction in haiti debate 
i will keep the european parliament constantly informed of the progress made on haiti reconstruction .
today , haiti needs 80 % of its export earnings to pay for its imported agricultural produce .
it is also the result of the domination and pillaging of haiti by many countries .
keep working towards that goal .
i believe that this can be put in place and could be successful .
the debate is closed .
question hour with the president of the commission
we discussed this in the college meeting today .
i do , however , admit that we have succeeded in some aspects .
so , we need genuine cooperation and support in that .
however , the region does not deserve this .
in bolivia , for example , approximately 60 % of the population live below the poverty line .
these events cannot simply be put on one side .
whether justifiably or not , this was obviously one of the causes of the clashes .
the same thing also applies to uzbekistan and to other countries .
written statements rule 149 
it is on that basis that we cooperate to protect our common interests .
the summit should also address the subject of reciprocal visa free travel .
no mention is made of the fact that canada did not play a particularly positive role in copenhagen .
they will need to be vigilant .
by 2020 , tar sand will probably have produced more emissions than austria and ireland .
however , it is important for us to find a middle way .
we should support the protection of intellectual property , but oppose blanket surveillance and persecution on the internet .
written statements rule 149 
this is the stage we are at .
de I welcome the fact that the commission is dealing with this subject from a competition perspective .
subject activity of credit rating agencies
el mr president , I thank the commissioner for his reply .
will we adopt await and seeapproach ?
it seems to me that these are , let us say , criteria which are possible to fulfil .
that is a real problem for me .
nevertheless , question time is scheduled until 8.30 on our agenda .
the commission intends to make full use of the new treaty instruments to achieve stronger policy coordination and governance .
the proposal that we are examining today therefore seems to be a breath of fresh air .
it has been said that in sweden , things are going very well .
that is not the same as an immigration policy , and people really should recognise the difference .
mrs krehl , who is replacing mr kirilov , has the floor .
the first is that we very much welcome the simplification of the structural funds .
the commission presented the first draft as long ago as july last year .
now let us turn to the future for a moment .
in these dark and overcast times , the kirilov report may be a breath of fresh air .
written statements rule 149 
the commission must not stop there , however .
therefore , this is a situation that we have seldom encountered on the european market .
in recent years , we have taken things too far with the removal of many of the market regulations .
but we are not out of the woods yet , so to speak .
i hope the commission is as concerned about this as members of parliament are .
the debates will be held from 09.00 to 13.00 and from 15.00 to 19.00 .
these actions must be highly effective , even under the most difficult circumstances .
this is an extremely large amount of money .
this is all good news , ladies and gentlemen .
obviously , amendments to the legal framework are also beginning to have an impact .
this is the guarantee of objectivity and the way to ensure compliance with international accounting rules and best practices .
the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats performs its work in full awareness of this responsibility .
fair is fair , however , and greater transparency is also needed in our own parliament .
commissioner šemeta , I would ask you to address this in your reply .
for that reason , I would like to propose eleven approaches to a solution .
unfortunately , that is not currently the case .
until progress is assessed , we also call for the freezing of funds to the annual level of 200here , we have the beginnings of a compromise .
rather support turkey's accession according to the accession criteria that the community itself has set .
having said that , there is still room for improvement .
my second request regards budgetary control .
in this regard , we urge the commission to produce recommendations on drafting these management statements .
i would like to reject that suspicion .
i fully share your views and the views of other members who talked about this issue .
action has been taken and clear and precise rules introduced in this field , too .
however , there is still room for improvement . significant improvement , I would say .
as a result , we have a detailed draft mandate from the commission .
here , I again have to make clear what other experts and even the investigative authorities have said repeatedly .
such an agreement mixes together innocent citizens with those who may be guilty .
the european parliament will be consistent with the positions it has always held .
one of the trickier complications has been the issue of people's legitimate right to personal privacy .
of course , that will not be part of the negotiation .
this can be discussed .
this house has always been highly critical of the use and transfer of pnr data .
therefore , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur of this resolution for her work on this dossier .
the standards that we want have been set out clearly in the joint resolution .
that happened last year before christmas .
however , those who decided whether he could fly or not did not have the necessary information to hand .
unfortunately , there are .
we do not accept what the commission representative has said about there being no safe techniques .
there are practices and experiences from other countries with tragic results .
in addition , there is not even any european legislation on air quality for such emissions .
however , as we have heard , it is highly dangerous .
the subject before us is a very curious matter .
since 1990 , there have been some thirty cases worldwide of serious pollution caused by cyanide mining .
order of business
wednesday , 5 may 2010 
2008 discharge european training foundation
with the lisbon treaty in place , it is time for a review of the discharge process itself .
we all want to make sure that greece can overcome the problems from the past .
it noted , however , that certain aspects of the public procurement process could be improved .
that is why I voted for the report on the european agency for safety and health at work .
for these reasons , this proposal is to be welcomed .
i voted resolutely in favour of this text .
however , the commission was obliged to recast it , since the annex has been slightly amended .
the request for equal treatment for the outermost regions must be heard .
it is estimated that they will be finalised by the end of next year .
even in times of crisis let us fight for equal conditions in equivalent situations !
the rapporteur , mr szájer , rejects both national expert groups and the involvement of national authorities .
the democratic movement delegation welcomes the adoption of strategic goals for the eu's maritime transport until 20it must be realised that the european maritime sector mainly operates and competes in a global market .
the eu is the most significant global exporter and the second biggest importer .
in addition , particular attention needs to be given to protecting intellectual property rights .
the success of the project will depend to a large extent on the continued financial commitment of member states .
clearly , european agriculture must play a major role in combating climate change .
i am resolutely confident that the cap will become more sustainable over time .
that is why I voted for the report on the commission and executive agencies .
i therefore abstained during the final vote .
the european parliament has expressed its stance on this matter on a number of occasions .
european environmental legislation enshrines the precautionary principle and requires the prevention and monitoring of water pollution .
we hope that the member states will stop supporting mining projects using cyanide based technologies .
on behalf of the european parliament , I offer condolences and expressions of sympathy to the victimsfamilies .
parliament responds that there is no need .
my group will vote against this report because it disregards that important principle .
the ball is therefore back in the council's court .
thisphantomsituation will certainly not do much for citizensconfidence in the eu .
greece will undertake painful efforts , but we all know that there are no alternatives to such efforts .
we need responsible behaviour from all our market players .
they must not become detached from their economic and societal function .
will this argument be taken up by the commission ?
greece rather , mr papandreou is not being given the time to achieve a consensus in greece .
ladies and gentlemen , we are held captive by the theory of the ever closer union .
anyone who digs for money or gold should also be responsible for the damage in cases of doubt .
it will have to be implemented and applied through the national reform programmes .
we have decided on a set plan , new energy technology .
let us remember what happened to the services directive in this chamber .
for us poles , whom I represent here , the wordsolidarityhas great significance .
we have provided no clarification with regard to the future development of the european union .
that is not a criticism , either .
they then set out bold objectives and try to convince people that everything really will be better this time .
there are many indications that the utopian and socialist 2020 project will share the fate of the lisbon strategy .
it is simply a question of carrying out this planning .
it was with great sadness that I learnt of the deaths in greece it is very sad .
women , people aged over 45 and young people continue to have the most difficulty in finding work .
now there is a legal basis for the accession becoming a reality .
this question has been posed by our colleagues here and , yes , we do need it .
i remember as a student reading joseph weiler's articles about the protection of human rights .
written statements rule 149 
however , standards are only one of the instruments for helping industry .
many of the issues that I wanted to mention have already been raised here .
standardisation of vehicles and ensuring their universal operability in the european market is essential .
my country , the netherlands , has made a choice .
first of all , we lack a proper communications strategy .
electric vehicles help renewable energies , which have a weak spot they are irregular .
she raised the issue of lithium , along with other meps who have spoken about batteries during this debate .
consideration must be given to these struggles and the worsening of exploitation must stop .
it is time to respect the dignity of those who work and create wealth .
jobbik believes that it is possible to rid political life of corruption .
the leaders of european states pretend that nothing is going on .
the irregularity rate for the eu funds paid out has never been as low as in this year .
it is unacceptable to give eu funds to third countries without any established indicators .
this regulation was adopted in 200this regulation will expire on 31 may 20parliament is concerned about this reform .
fourthly , they need investment security , in other words contractual protection and no more revisions .
they need to be able to make safe investments over a long period .
i mean everybody's opinions , including yours , of course .
the debate is closed .
the second key word in the report is inequality , and several types of inequality at that .
some actions will build on the result of the good work done so far .
the commission stands ready to provide all the necessary support .
this is something we must especially ensure accessibility to medicines that come onto the market .
thus we have never before lent so much to countries such as hungary , lithuania and romania .
i would like to know is this the case ?
without doubt , the current economic crisis has highlighted the important work of the european investment bank .
i do not want anything to do with a person of this kind .
now it is crucially important that all the national parliaments finalise their decisions soon .
mr hans peter martin has asked for the floor due to personal allusions .
the best way for this is to simplify the complicated bureaucracy and create clear procedures .
secondly , it must bring the perpetrators to justice .
we have done this at the last minute , but we have responded to the needs of our citizens .
de mr president , animal welfare is indivisible .
it must be standardised and we need a global definition of it .
mrs mcguinness , thank you , and many greetings to your visitorsgroup .
i could not support this report on that basis , and I warn colleagues about its implications .
this in itself is quite understandable since health affects all of us and those closest to us .
we understand your concerns .
the united states needs europe , and I respectfully submit that europe needs the united states .
as you said , listen and talk to each other .
the exceptional circumstances fully justify the exceptional solutions adopted .
meanwhile , bakiyev fled the country to seek refuge in kazakhstan .
in europe 380 000 businesses are involved in motor vehicle distribution and services .
all measures intended to fight cancer and minimise its effects should be supported .
there must be greater political coordination by member states in these areas .
therefore , the idea to create a climate change monitoring platform would seem to be a good one .

the debate on the bauer report will be postponed until the next part session .
thursday
that is what I wanted to talk to you about .
in the islands I hail from , it is the main industry .
we should not ignore this reality we should recognise it .
should we abolish interest ?
the code of silence must end here .
it was finally issued by the spanish presidency , which has demonstrated exceptional tact and perseverance .
their work is of just as much benefit to the economy as the work of an employee .
they therefore have the same right to social protection as the state accords to employees .
however , in looking for suitable mechanisms for this protection , we must fully respect the principle of subsidiarity .
this must also come from the enterprises themselves , however .
the next step must be to provide paternity leave , too , so that we can ensure genuine equality .
europe's campaign to protect women is making headway with this text .
pt madam president , this directive needs to be reviewed urgently .
the member states will also have a clear obligation to grant social protection to assisting spouses , on request .
i therefore believe that these members could , in good conscience , vote for the other amendments .
a separate article was introduced , along with several recitals and provisions concerning funding related aspects .
it must not benefit industry alone .
it follows that the uk independence party regards this report with suspicion .
this proposal started off as mainly technical and non political and was just a means to bring three directives together .
all too often , newspaper stories have drawn our attention to cases of allergies in children and women .
we consider it essential to simplify standards and achieve greater legal certainty .
this evaluation is a prerequisite for any legislative initiative on the matter .
it states that only four per cent of overseas development aid is dedicated to agriculture .
agenda of the next sitting see minutes
the treaty of lisbon has a direct or indirect effect on all of the european parliament's services .
via handshakes , like knows like , shadowy deals in back rooms , tens of millions are added to the budget .
the elite decides , and the public coughs up .
the committee on budgetary control will do everything in its power to point out where things are not working .
these institutions are clearly expanding their activities , with greater powers and a greater workload .
the vote tomorrow is very timely for the sis ii project .
such a scheme would merely encourage more refugees , genuine or not , to come to the european union .
of course , we might wish that this work could be more effective and more successful .
we are preparing for a hopefully successful milestone 2 test on sis later this autumn .
i am going to talk about the canary islands .
i am thinking about numerous products tomatoes , bananas , and the livestock sector .
some decisions will even be applied retroactively .
milk is the azoresmain agricultural product .
the energy performance of buildings recast 
equal treatment between self employed men and women 
we also insisted on the importance of parliament being kept duly informed about the actual implementation of the assistance .
it seems to me this will make more sense .
oral explanations of vote
furthermore , energy savings for energy efficient buildings average 30 % over conventional buildings .
these texts also stipulate that energy saving must be a fundamental element in the renovation of buildings .
this directive represents an important contribution to the fight against climate change .
it is for that reason that I voted against this report .
i therefore support the setting up of a fund at european level .
the report on the schengen information system and its modernisation contributes to this magnificent breakthrough in free intra european movement .
the latter wishes to take refugeesnationality as the basis for deciding who has priority to be resettled .
do we have to receive all of them in our countries , on the orders of this organisation ?
that is a long term struggle , but it is something worth fighting for .
we must invest we must provide certainties , offer opportunities .
we must redouble our efforts we must put young people at the centre of our european policies .
there are definitely more problems than those I have mentioned .
we owe it to the future generation of europeans .
for these reasons , the ecr group has abstained on amendments 1 in my opinion , this is essential information that must always be communicated to the consumer .
the macro financial assistance for ukraine is the first case to be decided under the new procedure .
farmers have always been the most ardent and steadfast supporters of european union integration .
i am in favour of the report submitted .
that is exactly what we want for the new cap .
farmers do not need more eu direct support they need fairer prices for their products .
by endorsing this document , we have given expression to our determination over simplification of the common agricultural policy .
furthermore , clarification is still required for questions including public private partnerships , town planning and service concessions .
i applaud the rapporteur for his work and am voting in favour of this .
i fully recognise the importance of eu development policy and of assistance to developing countries .
consequently , in the name of general safety , we need to ensure compliance with these regulations .
the next item is the joint debate on 
i fully share parliament's concern as regards combating organ trafficking .
let me also raise another issue adopting a law is the first step .
however , I am even more pleased that this is a topic which is genuinely european .
of course , we must be extremely vigilant as regards the issue of illegal organ trafficking .
the basque country euskadi has the world record for organ donation .
as I understand it , these two systems still coexist in member states .
de madam president , I have followed this debate very closely .
the directive will provide a comparable safety standard across the union and increased trust in transplantation systems .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 19 may 20 the sitting was suspended at 16.25 and resumed at 16.30 
this is a regrettable loophole that should be removed from the rome statute .
free speech will always be sacrificed because that is the eu's default position .
it will be very difficult to explain to our citizens which court is the right one for their complaint .
at the moment , there are several dozen towns in northern hungary that are entirely under water .
we will do that systematically in all our discussions with partners outside of europe .
this action plan is a guide for very concrete measures to be taken during the next five years .
our citizens demand and deserve better protection against terrorism and against organised or trans border crime .
the arrest warrant ms ludford was just speaking about this .
it is going to be on your table .
unfortunately , too often , copyright is presented as an obstacle to the creation of a single digital market .
i am thinking about a european definition of orphan works .
subject european sme week
the greatest challenge being faced by small and medium sized enterprises at the present is securing capital and funding .
will question 33 , in part 3 , be taken ?
moreover , this is another stain on our current model of european integration .
it rests with the local authorities and regional institutions to help such people as quickly as possible .
we want and we need to move away from this oil based society .
we cannot put up with a similar situation here .
i think that here , too , we should take the lead and set a good example .
in other words , does there always have to be an accident before we learn anything ?
was it human error ?
i will therefore be speaking on his behalf this evening .
unfortunately , there is no intention of this happening .
perhaps you are not in a position to answer that precisely .
i will now move on to my final question .
as a consequence , I believe we should draw some conclusions from this relatively critical situation .
i know that we cannot fight the elements .
this was said by a famous spanish sailor regarding a big naval battle that we lost .
the necessary penalty proceedings must naturally follow .
they seem to apply a more measured approach and I believe that we could perhaps learn something there .
i have no doubt that the commissioner , who is with us this evening , will spearhead this .
the role of eurocontrol must also be closely examined .
i must ask you to continue working to this end .
this applies to both right wing and left wing governments .
my group is asking europe to wake up .
therefore , we need economic governance and we also ultimately need the strength to implement our own regulations .
i would like to say , mrs sinclaire , that I am watching the time .
mr president , the council was unanimous let us also show that kind of unanimity .
you spoke today about the reform of the labour market and the pension system .
fr mr president , ladies and gentlemen , yes , we need responsible public spending .
the structural problem of ours has been that public overspending went on for too long .
the president cut off the speaker 
in any case , the eu always takes the opportunity .
this would really just mean going from bad to worse .
political strengthening is not being followed by the appropriate financial strengthening .
but it is also time to look around and see what other actions are contributing to the recent turmoil .
these may include increased euroscepticism and uncertainty among those countries that are preparing to enter the euro area .
noli me tangere touch me not !
ten pages sounds short , but it is full of concrete initiatives .
this is heavy stuff , which is what we need in europe .
none of the member states is able to mount effective resistance to global threats on its own .
after the vote 
today is a great day for european citizens and for european patients .
my group's amendment aims to move the strasbourg week from week 10 to week that does not prevent you from holding a plenary session on the second tuesday in march .
before the vote 
mr president , the commissioner informed us just before the vote about the thrombin issue .
if you hadn't done so , it would probably be the case that we would be still here .
is it really the job of politicians to manage our food ?
therefore , I think a labelling requirement is not sufficient in this case .
that is not the case .
in this case , the question is related to the electricity used and its efficiency .
it will establish the fulcrum of an integrated and sustainable policy from an environmental standpoint .
for the reasons I have stated , I commend the rapporteur and express my agreement .
i voted for the draft directive on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation .
issues relating to the diet and health of citizens are extremely sensitive and must be considered carefully and objectively .
i will vote in favour of the approval of this substance only if we impose a clear labelling requirement .
in romania , 13 people on the transplant waiting list die every day due to the lack of donors .
this could be our chance to guarantee the human rights and fundamental freedoms of eu citizens .
this needs to change .
we are talking about the direction , and also about implementation in the near future .
when we talk about europe 2020 , what are we talking about ?
the citizens are our most important allies in achieving our joint objectives .
we cannot do this by convincing ourselves that we can keep following the same old tracks .
objectives in those fields cannot be enforced at european level and rightly so .
do we want to reduce the number of poor workers , of which there are nearly 17 million ?
el mr president , the current lisbon strategy has simply been renamed europe 2020 strategy .
let us build on a foundation of nation states .
we must not forget the whole small and medium enterprise sector , including both small scale manufacturers and retailers .
we therefore need a minimum framework of disincentives for redundancy .
we need to clarify certain points .
this is not an appeal to postpone our actions in the field of public finances .
i am not implying anything of the sort .
that the market must be reassured .
who is the market , though ?
how much longer do people have to endure this cynical approach ?
all of this earns its rightful place in the europe 2020 strategy .
investing in it bears no risk .
we absolutely need to offer something positive to our citizens that will offset that situation .
are we really taking to task the players in the financial markets who have contributed to the crisis ?
it would also make the eu 2020 strategy relevant to individuals and citizens right across europe .
greece is not taking money from other nations .
secondly , we already have high government deficits .
now it is time to save .
however , there are a number of areas which I would be concerned about .
no one can assess its long term consequences at this stage .
research can also build bridges between universities and business .
this report reflects outdated and failed thinking .
i wish to thank mr pál schmitt , who is presently speaker of the hungarian parliament .
universities can also contribute to training the smesstaff as part of the lifelong learning process .
i , too , wish to congratulate the rapporteur .
after all , business does not set itself such an objective .
as a romanian mep , I have even more interest in this particular issue of the kozloduy nuclear plant .
or can anyone else see any reason in it ?
i wanted to demonstrate the fact that we are capable of listening .
i must say to you , however , that your speech seemed entirely improper to me .
when shutting down part of the power plant , its staff will face new challenges .
since 2004 , political contacts have increased in profile and intensity .
all that is left are the dreams of thousands of people , many of whom died as refugees .
the union for the mediterranean is not , of course , the framework for addressing regional conflicts .
i am convinced that growth of the union can reinforce the unity of europe .
this is principally because of the problems relating to belarusparticipation .
however , the ufm does , nonetheless , face certain political tensions .
in the kirilov report , we are choosing the second of these two options .
we urgently need a peaceful solution in nagorno karabakh and in the occupied azerbaijani areas .
frankly speaking , it is a step which certainly is overdue .
we finished the conference 10 minutes ago .
the aim of the rapporteur and of the 250 other members is to destroy the economy .
however , if we fail to do this , the whole of europe will go bankrupt !
high debt and deficit levels are a grave concern to the uk and across many member states .
how can that be ?
why am I mentioning this ?
this is the root of all the misunderstanding .
i voted for the schmitt report to encourage cooperation between universities and companies .
in writing . I supported this report on the union for the mediterranean ufm .
i believe that the interests of european and mediterranean citizens should always take precedence over those of the financiers .
nevertheless , much needs to be done along the road towards genuine religious freedom in pakistan .
i am going to take four speakers .
the united states of america has been a lot more active than the european union in this matter .
the vote will take place shortly .
the promotion of tolerance is the key to protecting religious minorities in pakistan .
however , to ensure this happens , we need moderation because democracy cannot prevail through violence .
these people are very critical of their unfair treatment and lack of rights .
i would therefore like to express my sympathy with those who have lost family members .
burma is going to hold an election this year for the first time in 30 years .
unfortunately , the election laws published do not provide for fair and free elections .
although improvements have been made in individual cases , the human rights situation in burma remains extremely poor .
we welcome the tone of this resolution calling for increased economic sanctions .
the report by mr quintana , the united nations special rapporteur , is very clear .
that , I am afraid , is the problem , but your comments have been noted .

what does this mean in practice ?
there are some concerns around agriculture .
my second point concerns the question of gaza .
i would like to endorse what mr färm said about youth policy and the promotion of young people .
that is very important .
i think those were the only factual matters .
commissioner lewandowski promised us a budget focusing on young people and education .
unfortunately , the actual financial support proposed does not meet the expectations of the european parliament .
so we have an interesting debate tonight .
it is by no means perfect , but provides a basis for progress .
what are these mdgs ?
in my view , we have come full circle .
and this we should also take into account when designing the external action service .
the millennium development goals should and can be achieved , and I say this with full responsibility .
it has been an interesting debate .
its main objective must be to promote the autonomy , independence and initiative of the relevant countries .
i firmly believe that the needs of the market will highlight the benefit of these investments .
pointless large scale projects , coupled with a refusal to face reality , will only gobble up money .
we certainly need this .
the reason was mentioned by commissioner reding greater economic activity and a greater concentration of land transport .
that is why I warmly welcome the agreement reached by the two co legislators .
in fact , the procedure was extremely difficult .
i am pleased we are debating and voting this directive this week , still under the spanish presidency .
i say to ukip that there is no call to get nationalistic about the quality of justice .
the vote will take place on wednesday 16 june 20written statements rule 149 
as has been stated in the past , it demonstrates a lack of respect for parliament .
we would be truly lost .
the council will also take its decision without any political benefit .
this sort of logic should also be applied in the event of euro area enlargement .
they prepared the ground , in fact , for today's euro crisis .
the romanian government has issued an emergency ordinance banning dozens of such substances .
romania is fortunate because it has noticed the rise in this phenomenon in good time .
the very first legal act of the new hungarian parliament was an act on dual citizenship .
the majority of us support eurostat's extended powers and the increased opportunities for inspection .
the cost of running these pools would amount to perhaps eur 1 million per year .
this is a timely report that is of a high quality and that is economically and politically important .
personally , mr langen , I am in favour of such an approach .
this is also a very important issue on which we must continue to work .
in addition , we are , indeed , dealing here with a classic question of recognition .
i warmly welcome the european parliament's intention to participate again this year with a strong delegation .

it is a treaty that seeks the closest possible union .
the efforts made by all spanish authorities have also been crucial .
the first is the european citizensinitiative .
in the closing phases , however , it was the presidency that made the decisive contribution .
i have the following to say to the president of the commission .
that means you can already mothball 20we are always saying we want growth , growth , growth .
i believe that after six months . well , we will have to see after the next few presidencies .
we should have the clarity of mind to discuss this problem in the future .
that is the plain truth .
the speaker agrees to answer the question of another member in accordance with rule 149 8 
we could still do that too , mr schulz .
on several occasions , we have missed the council at question time in strasbourg .
we now have a social nightmare of mass unemployment and a tax on living standards across europe .
unfortunately , not a great deal of this proved possible to achieve .
from the start .
we have felt close to this institution , although , at times , there have been harsh voices .
spain has set an example .
once again , I would like to thank the spanish presidency and mr zapatero .
this means that we have the possibility of revisiting this afresh , without surprising anyone or damaging mutual interests .
internal european bank data transfers will also largely not be conducted via swift .
the new agreement was approved on 28 june 20article 18 is a good article .
this is a methodology we need to master .
one thousand five hundred dossiers have already been handed over in that way .
the rapporteur laid out the provisions that we will take .
by what right ?
the paris convention regulates the frequency , quality and organisational procedures of international exhibitions .
eu member states with access to the sea are already iczm members , however .
since this comes into conflict with considerations of subsidiarity , I voted against it .
interdisciplinary cooperation is needed here , including in the european parliament committees .
this report focuses on the contribution of eu regional policy to resolving the economic crisis .
however , it seemed preferable to me to abstain on amendment all of this had to do with a vote at second reading .
i am pleased that it was adopted with a resounding majority .
this makes maritime goods transport less attractive and means that it is not used to the optimum extent .
the eu airline industry is already in dire straits .
it is crucial to have cleaner vehicles and more efficient transport systems in order to reduce this impact .
the european economy , and therefore employment , depends on the sustainable future of transport .
unfortunately , however , the finances allocated to this sector are inadequate .
that is why I voted as I did .
even if young people do find work , they are very often only given temporary contracts .
vocational training is indispensable .
this is almost double the average unemployment rate .
these have a greater impact on young people and women .
the european union is facing a major financial , economic and social crisis .
in writing . the report as adopted in committee has been adopted in plenary .
the report deals with the issue adequately , and I will vote in favour of its adoption .
reduction is one of the best ways of combating problems related to waste .
we have the institutions .
we are addressing this in our proposals , in particular , as regards the euro area .
applause 
this is the point of departure for the larosière exercise .
we need to arrive at consensus .
today , you are rushing us towards a social and political explosion .
that could only enhance the role of europe in this matter .
this leaves some leeway for reaching a compromise at a first reading within the next few weeks .
it is insisting that the fox should be put in charge of the henhouse .
first , there are the issues concerning efficiency .
let nobody be confused , however this is not a sign of weakness .
do not say one thing here and another there .
they will not be different but they will be balanced .
it is simply asking for european supervision for european actors and national supervision for national actors .
i can think of no other name for that than a political federation .
here lies the essence of the entire debate on financial architecture and the supervision of financial architecture .
the citizens sitting here and watching us may quite rightly ask so what is your solution ? 
in these troubled times , the european systemic risk board must get to work as quickly as possible .
they must not degenerate into empty shells which passively observe market developments .
the safeguard clause is an obstructive instrument and contravenes community solidarity .
we should be proud .
we have gone through full time , we are now in extra time .
in the meantime , the markets have done their job .
like you , I think that we must go further .
the next item is the joint debate on 
i think that we can go even further in this matter .
however , the future supervisory authority will be responsible for the interpretation .
so , work is now in progress .
el commissioner , thank you very much for your reply .
indeed we have been pushing for a debate on the mercosur bilateral talks .
i am very angry , quite frankly , about the way this has been done .

on top of this , hundreds of local authorities are becoming fair trade towns .
i want to know if any assessment has been made .
can these things affect our health ?
i do not believe it is the latter .
a great deal has already been said about meat from cloned animals .
we certainly do need it .
there is no reason , therefore , to have to fall back on meat from cloned animals .
there is no reliable evidence available to show what kind of suffering such animals endure .
absolutely not .
fifth , clarification of the fact that all food products containing nanomaterials require case by case authorisation by eu citizens .
in the light of this , I am truly disappointed with the course of the negotiations .
pl mr president , I would like to comment on two matters .
the president cut off the speaker 
all parties must therefore take responsibility for ensuring that no illegal timber is sold in the eu .
in my opinion , parliament has set an example of how it can operate and express its democratic power .
this illegal practice places sustainable timber exploitation and the companies involved in it at risk .
it is also important that we do not accord timber a status that is inferior to other materials .
there are options for bypassing even this system .
while it could still be improved , the proposed regulation is ambitious and courageous .
cross border crisis management in the banking sector 
as far as cross compliance is concerned , I think that it has had a positive impact on direct payments .
it is also essential that we maintain the second pillar of the common agricultural policy .
however , I do not wish to prolong the debate .
what we notice is that we are demanding more and more of our farmers .
two pillars absolutely , I agree with that .
europe has a particular responsibility to guarantee food safety in the world .
we thus provide for the possibility of a transitional period .
this undermines the sense of solidarity , equality and community .
in writing . de I thank the rapporteur .
can we get this parliament to work for the members of parliament , not for the administration of parliament ?
europe buys 38 million tonnes of soya and feed for cattle .
how many tonnes of beef ?
the two are completely linked and therefore we need to understand what the impact will be .
agriculture is only one part of this macro agreement .
i believe that if we make the right choices it is possible to successfully conclude both negotiations .
do the agreements include a net exporter clause , in order to prevent the development of a trade triangle ?
the european commission has disregarded these developments .
will any of this be taken into consideration in your impact assessments ?
a commission that claims to act in the best interests of the citizens must do so .
on the one hand , my colleagues want to stop our fishermen receiving any subsidy .
doing both of these things at the same time will place too high a burden on our fishermen .
i would also like to thank him for his excellent cooperation .
this market is growing rapidly and is increasingly dependent on imports from third countries .
i am sure that we will be able to vote at 12.i would like to say that we are taking care of all the concerns mentioned by the members .
fr let us calm down !
then they could determine the true view of parliament .
on this occasion , though , I believe we have got the balance right .
lv thank you , mr president .
the macedonian government has democratic legitimacy .
we must now work together to provide suitable financial resources for these political tasks .
noterror agreementrespects grassroots freedoms .
on the other hand , there is the protection of citizensrights .
timely coordination of the different areas of eu external policy by the commission is clearly important .
regrettably , children are the main victims of this type of explosive material .
farmers also provide food , which we need in order to live .
i voted in favour of the report by mr cadec .
it is an important step towards preventing global distortions of competition and supporting honest , law abiding fishermen .

judge afiuni's case is a sad reminder of venezuela's negative attitude towards human rights .
we are following the tendency of political polarisation re emerging in the country with concern .
what is currently happening here is appalling .
this should be one of the future topics of our discussions with china when we have our bilateral dialogue .
china must change its law to protect the victims of trafficking instead of returning them to north korea .
the negotiated text for this free trade agreement provides for the possibility of designating outward processing zones .
the european commission deeply appreciates the rationale of this proposal in the motion for a resolution .
