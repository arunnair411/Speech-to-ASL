it has been requested that this draft be amended as follows .
monday 
mr president , we have , of course , given this matter a great deal of thought .
this is an important basic principle and an important statement by parliament .
the details of the negotiations taking place in egypt today , in particular , are of crucial importance .
it is you .
we are in parliament , lad .
would mr cohn bendit and mr ferber please stop their argument now .
anything connected with these debates can be addressed in these debates .
el mr president , allow me to inform the house about turkey's offensive behaviour towards greece .
on behalf of every new member state , I wish to register my protest .
you will , of course , receive an answer on this point .
i wish to invoke this hungarian folk greeting to wish you a blessed new year .
this onslaught is not alone disproportionate it is entirely unjustified .
israel must now understand that there are indeed consequences for its actions .
the complexity of this issue can be seen just from the length of time you took for your speech .
the debate will take place on wednesday afternoon .
this also means the loss of probably 2 000 more jobs that depend on dell production in ireland .
thank you mr president .
for eight consecutive years , gas production by gazprom has been stagnating at the same level .
two of our fellow members have already spoken of this .
the negative impact is multiplied exponentially on the fringes of europe and society .
the reason given is that these persons hold the karta polaka .
this is obviously ridiculous and outrageous .
every speaker is saying how serious and dangerous the european union's level of energy dependency is .
the european union imagines itself to be an active force in international relations and a global political player .
this action is immoral , perverted and bizarre , because it essentially constitutes a pre election campaign .
this is a bloody pre election campaign .
i am yet more shocked by the position of the european commission .
with over 900 now dead , the futility of politics by war is painfully evident .
cs thank you , madam president .
i should like to highlight an issue brought to my notice by schoolchildren concerned about the natural environment .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports 
we have not made it easy for ourselves .
we have struggled to find the right solutions in our negotiations with the council and with the commission .
sustainability as the overall concept for european agriculture will guarantee healthy food and a healthy environment .
the basic principleas much as necessary , as little as possibleassumes comprehensive , sound knowledge .
plant protection products are , in fact , medicine for plants .
compliance with the stipulations of the water framework directive is top priority .
risk reduction means that professional users must obtain sound and ongoing training in the use of plant protection products .
however , a ban must be based on scientifically sound findings and not on political dogmas .
first of all , sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent collaboration .
therefore , safety can only be achieved with an outright ban .
we will ensure successful environmental protection with the cut off for persistent , bioaccumulative toxic pbt substances .
they would dilute this compromise .
this is a compromise to which the council has already given its approval .
parliament helped to make the directive more ambitious than the council's common position on certain important points .
the agreement reached represents significant progress in the protection of public health and the environment in the european union .
plant protection products play an important role in agriculture , horticulture , forestry and gardening .
we therefore need to ensure they are regulated in an effective and balanced way .
duplicative testing on animals would be completely avoided .
the commission has just made a declaration on this point .
these are substances that impair the development of children's brains .
i should like to reassure certain stakeholders who have cast doubt on the availability of active substances and products .
this compromise takes account of their fears .
the three zone system guarantees member states the possibility of authorising a larger number of products .
of course I am concerned about any overuse of pesticides and about their effects .
there is no doubt that rates of cancer have increased .
this makes our potatoes and winter cereal crops susceptible to weeds and disease such as blight .
in theory this may work .
you should read the agreement !
what the pesticide industry wants is that we do not set any criteria .
and now to mrs klass , many thanks for your work !
and , of course , we would have liked more rights for the residents of areas adjacent to agriculture .
parliament rightly insisted on legislation that would be effective and suitable for the task .
we should , in fact , be concerned with general interests .
this chiefly concerns high risk substances .
we are taking a real step forward and I hope that the parliamentary vote will not come to blows !
there will be job losses , some units will become non viable and production will stop .
integrated pest programmes have already decreased the need for pesticides .
as ever , a compromise is about give and take .
it will be impossible for poor countries to deal with this matter without union aid .
i should like to thank mrs klass and mrs breyer very much for the reports they have prepared .
the sustainable production and consumption of food is , after all , a basic human right .
this package lacks the sufficient scientific rigour which is needed both to defend our health and our economy .
it is my fear that the package will have the opposite effect of the progressive intentions behind it .
this report proposes strict and tighter controls .
collectively , it must be possible for us to be protected against toxicity .
it is important for it to be stated that a product comes from the eu member states .
let me tell you now .
this is why it is important to narrow the chasm between regular and organic farming in a responsible manner .
first of all , some of the most dangerous chemical pesticides are being banned .
exceptions are allowed where no alternatives are yet available .
that , too , is important .
significant financial support is a priority , rather than additional legal provisions .
this will be a credit to parliament .
my farmers struggle continually with fungal infestation .
we are told pesticides might disrupt dna .
gm is based on disrupting dna .
in the face of the irresponsible pressure exerted by ecologists , it is comforting that common sense has prevailed .
our debates about chemicals are too often conducted on a very irrational level .
it is welcome that we have retained the three zone ruling even with considerable exemptions for member states .
a courageous step to a consistent internal market solution would look different at this stage 
i believe that the compromises we hope to agree on are sound .
they should ensure that the restrictions introduced will promote health without threatening the development of european agriculture .
our farmers will have to pay more for safer pesticides .
but in this instance the commission still has a great task ahead of it .
these principles were taken into consideration in a balanced manner , overall .
member states will have sufficient room to manoeuvre to implement this accordingly .
the directive lays down a training and certification system for distributors and professional users of pesticides .
in my low lying country , the situation is very specific .
for this reason , this directive poses extremely serious dangers .
yes , that may be the case , but the question is how justified are these worries ?
what happens if there are no alternatives ?
if the commission would work with eu food producers on this , we could make progress .
es madam president , I would like to make reference to the breyer report .
what is so vital or of so much concern that the commission are opposed to an impact assessment ?
let us leave it and just assume that people will not bother about it ?
we have done a huge amount of surveys on this .
i leave you with one or two last thoughts on this .
we have needed fungicides to reduce blight and actually grow the potatoes .
we have had two of the wettest summers on record it is time for you to look again .
my pleasure !
alcohol , pure alcohol , is a hazard .
the eu impact assessment has been referred to .
i would invite the agrochemical industry and their cerp community to look into and invest in this area .
it is not simply a matter of measuring levels of residues in food .
we must not permit such unequal terms of competition for european farmers .
this will have the effect of sending retail prices soaring , affecting worst those least able to pay .
but what have we done along the way ?
i think they will at least help give the industry some support in the future .
there is no point in europe legislating itself out of business because we cannot control what is imported in .
the principle of prevention must be applied .
only certain categories of small distributors will be exempt from this requirement .
let me reply , however , to some of the comments that have been made here .
this mrl is valid for eu production , but also for imported food and feed .
this is the position regarding imported goods .
we now look forward to the formalisation of the second reading agreement .
what was achieved is important .
we still need an evaluation .
we have managed to find a good compromise from different starting positions .
with the ban on these highly toxic substances , they will become illegal in europe .
therefore , there is no reason whatsoever to encourage further dissent , panic and fear !
the president cut off the speaker 
i heard what the commissioner said on the food import situation .
their cousins outside the european union can use these products .
sorry for the anger .
full stop .
i would encourage you to continue it in the corridors , if necessary .
written statements rule 142 
on this occasion , we also have the member states on our side , represented by the council .
the plan was due to be submitted to the council and parliament last autumn .
can you reassure me , commissioner , that the action plan is ready ?
between cities , in standards of protection for the urban environment ?
in road safety standards in cities ? in standards of citizensaccess to mobility ?
we need coordination and innovative projects , and to develop and share reliable and comparable statistics .
as a matter of fact , although cities are all different , they face common challenges .
the highlight has been the extremely successful civitas programme that started in 2000 .
we can help local authorities to implement related eu policies and to make best use of eu funding .
you have tried to sidestep the issue and you have done a balancing act .
possibility number one is there a shortage of technical information within the directorate general for transport ?
possibility number two you say that the conditions are not favourable .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the constant delay and your answer , commissioner , are not acceptable .
secondly , we only want to grant eu money if cities can present a sustainable mobility plan .
the cohesion fund may also support this work .
we agreed that these actions should be supportive , in other words , that they should involve assistance .
i am very disappointed with your response .
in all our cities , we face problems of mobility .
67 % of european citizens expect a european policy to be developed in this area .
last year we approved the report on promoting the use of green vehicles in public transport .
therefore , I have no doubt that what you have said will be seriously taken into account by him .
written statements rule 142 
even the directorate general for competition attended in great numbers .
i am vehemently opposed to the commission's plans .
member states organise and finance the public broadcasters as they see fit .
is that what we want ?
moreover , this test is very detailed the proposal is lacking in flexibility .
there are also differences in terms of language and culture .
the commission admitted that the proposals were probably excessively detailed and that the wording needed editing .
this was an excellent result .
you will understand , madam president , that I am pleasantly surprised with these pledges .
secondly , how can technological impartiality be guaranteed ?
this dialogue between the commission and parliament is important .
this concurs with our views both public and private broadcasting are important .
the objective of modernising the communication is to increase transparency and legal certainty .
why do we have these tests ?
because having these tests at the national level helps to avoid commission intervention .
we cannot agree that the amsterdam test would involve an unjustifiable administrative burden .
secondly , the draft exempts pilot projects from the test .
the solutions found in these countries are proportionate to the resources available .
well , to some extent , this is true , but not entirely .
we are 100 % behind balanced competitive relations between the public and private broadcasters .
there should be room for both to be able to provide quality content .
we get the impression with the proposals you are making now that you are actually encouraging over regulation .
we require this as part of the lisbon strategy .
there are already controlling bodies for public broadcasting the broadcasting councils .
we monitor the adaptation to technological change .
we monitor the measures in order to ensure fair competition .
our independence is guaranteed by law .
the commission agrees with these goals .
the draft communication makes clear that pilot projects are exempt from the tests .
the commission also wants to guarantee a mixture of public and private .
it protects the ability to keep up with changes in our fast moving media environment .
the union should endeavour to adopt an external energy policy .
as a result , I feel much empathy and involvement with that region .
the principle of statesterritorial integrity is sacred and must be respected in the future .
thirty thousand children die of hunger and poverty related illnesses a day .
i suppose , driving all of this , we need to look at the issue of research and development .
how do we do that ?
by providing stable prices and also looking at the costs of food production .
unless farmers get that income stimulus , they will pull back .
there is a lot in this report .
energy prices constitute only one of these factors but one which has both a direct and indirect impact .
the topic of biofuels was discussed in detail during the various ep sessions .
a sustainable eu biofuels policy is overall a pro poor policy .
enhanced trade flows are part of the solution towards food security .
the vote will take place on tuesday at 12 noon .
european and international systems for monitoring production and the market as an early warning system for identifying production trends 
such development will have to be sustainable and will have to rely first and foremost on local agriculture .
now more than ever agriculture is playing a central role in the areas of growth and development .
the separation of direct agricultural funding from production is likewise heading in this direction .
developing civil dialogue under the treaty of lisbon short presentation 
decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizen . 
the latter is a dialogue that is not defined in law .
i would like civil dialogue to be a reciprocal , two sided process .
this means it should not just involve the european union approaching citizens , and the latter responding .
i would like civil dialogue to be based on the principles of clarity and transparency .
i should like to add too that the member states should also be required to promote civil dialogue .
i have been unable to mention every part of this report .
it is one of the key tools for communication between european institutions , eu society and eu citizens .
the debate is closed .
civil society represents many non governmental and not for profit organisations established by the citizens of their own free will .
membership in a civil society organisation provides european citizens with the opportunity to take active part in policy making .
the mechanism of consultation forms an integral part of the activities of european institutions .
this must be prevented in future by a pro active information and dialogue policy .
this all brings to mind the definition of democracy .
in particular , many member states have made considerable efforts to meet their obligations with regard to the pact .
the debate is closed .
we have worked very well together on the production of the report .
nevertheless , some member states have not undertaken transposal .
it is possible , then .
this applies not only to consumers but also to small enterprises and tradespeople .
we know of many examples , such as annoying advertising and misleading and aggressive business practices .
we all know the address book fraud that is a widespread problem throughout europe .
we know about cheating on the lottery and much more besides .
these two acts would be a good start .
for those cases the commission will not hesitate to launch infringement proceedings .
misleading business to business practices are already covered by the directive concerning misleading and comparative advertising .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on tuesday at 12 noon .
only a well informed consumer is able to detect misleading advertising and avoid the disappointment it may cause .
cfp and the ecosystem approach to fisheries management short presentation 
healthy marine ecosystems can only be safeguarded through a policy which involves all sectors which impact on these ecosystems .
this is also the overall thrust of the report and we appreciate the agreement on this point .
the report touches on many questions regarding the specific instruments to be utilised in the future .
it is indicated that fishermen affected by management plans and measures to protect ecosystems should be subsidised or compensated .
in the mean time , I thank parliament for its support for our approach as expressed through this report .
written statement rule 142 
i would like to extend my thanks to all of these women .

the fund industry has not escaped unscathed from the financial crisis .
we have come a long way since july 200this is true at all stages initial authorisation , ongoing supervision and enforcement .
you have shown that europe can move speedily to bring about useful regulatory improvements .
you must build on this achievement now and complete the ambitious programme of implementing legislation .
the internal guarantees provided by ucits explain why they are recognised by investors well beyond europe's borders .
the changes made in 2001 opened new investment areas for ucits but they left behind several bottlenecks .
today , we can welcome the major advances in efficiency offered by the proposal that we have before us .
it is a complete passport and we welcome it .
the supervision measures it includes will certainly be effective in removing any doubts which might have been expressed .
on the principle , there is no more to say the passport is its own defence .
i do not exclude the possibility of success , but it is not guaranteed either .
i know this only too well , as I was responsible for steering through ucits in 200this has largely happened .
many obstacles were removed in 200i would like to remind everyone that it was not particularly easy then , either .
there will be greater protection for investors .
we are aware of the different opinions .
competition and openness are always good in a well organised market .
a balance must be achieved between relevant information and effectiveness .
a reasonable balance is also required in this area .
ucits have cleared the way and become a success and an esteemed trade mark outside europe , too .
most importantly , we have to achieve greater economies of scale in europe .
i am very glad to support mr klinz's report and the ucits revision .
we thus need the supervision issues in this area to be defined .
it is a result of a remarkably quick consensus .
today's debate has shown that we have broad cross party support for the compromise we have negotiated here .
thank you very much .
the first of january 2009 was the 10th birthday of our currency , the euro .
the euro area has become a rock of macroeconomic stability .
applause 
many more thought that it would never happen or that it was doomed to failure .
this price stability is an advantage for all european citizens .
the single currency is a factor for dynamism in the european economy .
de the last few months have demonstrated another advantage of the euro .
the european parliament played a crucial role at the pioneering stage .
parliament was the first institution in europe to make proposals for a single currency , back in 196these challenges were successfully overcome and the euro is firmly established today .
thirdly , enlargement .
we are now 16 countries .
as a tangible sign recognised around the world , the euro is a measure of stability .
after 10 years , it has to be recognised that the euro is an unquestionable success .
exceptional situations demand exceptional measures .
we must safeguard the foundations of this success .
this move had the backing and support of our partners in the benelux countries and italy .
let us counter the inevitability of failure with the energy of success .
there were 11 of us to start with , and now there are we are expecting others to join us .
however , an anniversary is also a time for looking to the future .
on the subject of economic cooperation , jean claude juncker described the crisis that we are going through .
let us learn then the lessons from this .
governments must learn to talk together about their economic policies .
i agree that we must not demand the exorbitant privilege of being the reserve currency .
finally , I believe that the euro is much more than just a currency .
we are working today , too , under the chairmanship of mrs berès , for the same representation .
the euro has been well received by the public .
it has gained the world's trust .
that is something we can all be proud of .
in 10 years , the euro has become a strong symbol for europe .
for those who do not , the euro was associated with price rises .
they are the guarantee of effectiveness , competiveness and growth .
in any case , the attraction of the euro remains intact .
the euro will have a key role to play in this new stability .
the ecb is only in charge of monetary policy .
european monetary union is a reality the euro has been in existence for 10 years today .
it can therefore be said that the european central bank has performed very well .
the euro's international role needs to be further strengthened .
this is no mere bagatelle .
were it not for the euro , we would have repeated the experience of 1992 , only worse .
the maastricht treaty was approved , but no political europe was created .
this target may seem a bit absurd .
all I would say is that we need to apply properly the good aspects of the maastricht treaty .
but the greek government is stuck inside the euro straitjacket .
there is nothing it can do .
it will take leadership , or possibly the inevitable economic meltdown .
you can ignore the markets if you want to , but in time the markets will not ignore you .
all have failed , all have damaged the participants , and so it is with the euro .
italy's competitiveness is shot to pieces .
happy birthday to the euro !
emu protects the profits of the monopolies and facilitates privatisation and merger .
the euro was 10 years old on 1 january 200at the same time , slovakia became the 16th country to use the euro .
according to current estimates , it will be around 0.6 % .
an additional stimulus is needed .
we have to keep to the basic principles and criteria of economic and monetary union .
on 1 january 2009 the euro became the official currency of slovakia .

trade and economic relations with western balkans 
developing civil dialogue under the treaty of lisbon 
de madam president , I have the following request .
obviously , I supported my own report .
it is not serving the people of europe well it is not serving the farmers of britain well .
until that burden is taken away from the european taxpayers , then we are going to be in difficulties .
it is a shame that nobody else seems to read some of these reports that go through this place .
it is reciprocal .
that means putting the treaty to a referendum .
if only we had two way dialogue .
look at those countries where fishermen are given rights that are tradable and passed on from generation to generation .
we will return to the explanations of vote after the formal sitting .
formal sitting latvia
we must and should rejoice in that .
mr president , it gives me great pleasure to invite you now to address the european parliament .
may I warmly welcome you once again to the european parliament .
applause 
dear friends , this year , 2009 , is a very significant year for latvia .
membership of these international organisations became a strategic aim for latvia following the restoration of independence in 199latvia clearly expressed its wish to participate in european and transatlantic economic and security structures .
on 18 november last year , latvia celebrated the 90th anniversary of its proclamation .
it once again affirmed our steadfast will to live in an independent , free and democratic nation .
peace reigned among the nations of the eastern bloc , but it was the peace of the prison courtyard .
today , I should like to look at much more recent history .
this year marks five years since latvia became a member of the european union and of nato .
what sort of time has this been for latvia ?
what has our nation gained ?
secondly , membership of the european union has improved the investment climate in latvia .
we can be proud that we have at our disposal such a unique mechanism of collaboration .
the european union offers great opportunities , but each nation and each society must grasp them by itself .
no !
we were persuaded that the laws of the market would by themselves be sufficiently efficient in promoting economic development .
that is indeed what happens .
in this situation , a complex approach at national , european and global level is what is needed .
that will only be possible by designing a new architecture and mechanisms for the financial system .
we welcome the commission's european economic recovery plan .
it is an important step out of the morass in which we find ourselves at this time .
this agreement provides for special attention to be paid to monitoring how the loan granted to latvia is utilised .
the european union has the foreign policy instruments to resolve this issue .
the energy market , however , is stagnating .
here , the european commission has done noteworthy work .
the global economy is much more closely linked than it was half a century ago .
at the same time , powerful new economic players have appeared on the world scene .
only together can we fulfil the promises of security and wellbeing for our citizens .
that is our common responsibility towards europe .
ladies and gentlemen , until 2004 , latvia's goal was membership of the european union .
there will no longer be old and new , small and large european nations .
what will be latvia's role in the european union of 2015 ?
our vision of an open europe and our experience of integration will be the spur to europe's openness .
ladies and gentlemen , 2015 is not far away only six years stand between us .
those are still wise words today .
i am convinced that europe will change materially .
it is how our work will be judged .
it is our responsibility .
applause 
on the basis of our common values , we are strong , democratic and free .
thank you , president zatlers , it was a joy to welcome you here today .
applause 
i think this piece of legislation will make it appropriate that we have higher standards across the european union .
a wide range of common products can be hazardous if the handling and usage instructions are ignored .
cs madam president , I would like to respond again to yesterday's plenary debate .
i would like to mention that we must apply these requirements strictly to imported goods as well .
madam president , I have a confession to make .
madam president , I too found this a particularly difficult decision .
i think we need impact assessments conducted on a scientific basis .
madam president , the efficient and effective use of pesticides is a necessity .
i agree with mrs wallis about the legislative process and that there should have been a third reading .
madam president , I tried to undermine the compromise by voting against those parts of this report .
just like the issue of safety one can never be too secure .
i agree in principle with paolo costa's report on civil aviation .
however , it is vital in this overseas partnership that we are real partners , not just on paper .
the future of the external transport policy requires good relations between the european community and the united states .
i voted in favour of this report for better legal regulation of companies within the eu .
furthermore , it is good that the report underlines the need to establish a common energy policy .
serbia , for example , is not even mentioned .
that is why constructive and positive signals from the european parliament are also important .
the eu has a key role to play in the recovery of that region .
the report is not in line with these views and we are therefore voting against it .
this means providing food for 70 million more people every year .
in writing . sv it is important that we combat and alleviate starvation .
i have , nevertheless , chosen to abstain , because the report was strongly protectionist in places .
however , there are also aspects with which we cannot agree 
in writing . the mcguinness report deals with issues of immense global importance .
otherwise the negotiations , which have already broken down , will continue to have little likelihood of success .
i voted against this report .
outside the legislative procedure , the report we have before us is not particularly impressive .
this entails an unnecessary increase in bureaucracy that leads nowhere .
how would this mindset be defined ?
this is binding on all eu policies and spheres of activity .
the success of dialogue depends on representativeness , and therefore on the strong commitment of key entities .
the european authorities must be open to dialogue and cooperation with the citizens and with organisations from civil society .
anyone may contribute to the common good .
there are alternative policies for the fishing industry in portugal .
in writing . I voted in favour of mr guerreiro's report .
a linear reduction in the number of products would be insane .
the problem with france must be solved with understanding .
controls must also be much more restrictive in order to fully protect public health .
i still regret the fact that we dropped the 50 % objective .
a european minimum distance would have been preferable from an environmental and public health point of view .
undoubtedly , businesses will shed jobs and even cease trading altogether .
no one disputes the importance of protecting the environment but this legislation is unbalanced .
it is overly prescriptive and lacks flexibility .
the commission has failed to carry out a sufficiently comprehensive and up to date impact assessment study .
this document will help to harmonise the legislation on pesticides .
in recent years the union has constantly increased the limit values and a reduction was therefore long overdue .
the chinese toy episode should be a lesson to us .
derogation options were expressly created for 12 substances .
i would prefer the common position as it would give a better balance between public health and food production .
we cannot legislate in the abstract !
whilst allowing low risk products onto the market , it bans 22 substances deemed to be very harmful .
european agriculture , which makes abundant use of plant protection products , will not be weakened .
it is vital that sufficient fund managers are available to maintain a proper watch on mc passports .
the directive sets basic requirements on the organisation , management and oversight of investment funds .
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
it is true that the national legislature could create derogations from this obligation .
as the european data protection supervisor said , it is a further benefit in the fight against child trafficking .
the respective initiatives should be introduced by the commission within the framework of the respective area of civil law .
the use of this type of data would only be acceptable if it truly offered protection to our children .
that is not yet the case .
we remain , however , open to any positive changes in the technology in this field .
this revolutionary principle has nothing to do with biometric data .
we believe that it has crucial implications for personal data safety and for fundamental rights .
we cannot agree that everyone holding the european passport is a usual suspect whose fingerprints are to be stored .
it is therefore right to create an exemption here for children .
this report does not speak about the reliability of biometric data itself .
however , I would like to explore this issue in a little more detail .
of course , every parent would happily hand over that amount if it contributed to their child's safety .
this is because normally the security of these documents is lower than the level applied when issuing biometric passports .
these factors are in turn a guarantee of a more effective fight against crime , terrorism and illegal immigration .
i wish to comment on just one point in the report .
experience shows that the number of children among the victims of human trafficking is steadily increasing .
in short , we should be reasonably flexible in this regard .
however , what arrangements would pertain when children travel by train , coach or other means of public transport ?
how would that be monitored ?
i think that we ought to include an instruction that benefits the child , or rather , the passenger .
a current study shows that it is unaccompanied minors who are the victims of such crimes .
i think the report is not only important , but also good .
i also call for the role of the european data protection supervisor to nevertheless be taken into account .
mr president , I also wish to thank mr coelho .
sk protecting children from abduction and trafficking requires the introduction of children's passports .
the new method of identification will simplify border controls .
this stays the same from conception to death and even beyond .
this is therefore an objective which can be used to achieve security for children .
for me it goes without saying that data protection laws must be respected .
we should not even be discussing that .
i will give the parliament several answers to several questions .
first , I have to say that , in its proposals , the commission has always stressed data protection .
thank you very much to all of you for your collaboration .
the debate is closed .
it is commendable that this requirement will now be enforced in all member states .
setting an age limit reduces the risk of an error being made when identifying people by taking their fingerprints .
in the short time we have available , I want to raise three important points .
the first is about the council .
let me also comment on the issue of exchange of information between the institutions .
some of your other assertions , mr cappato , are incorrect .
for example , you state that 90 % of legislative activity is done through comitology .
it can already be seen , mr cappato .
the allowances that meps claim are also public .
in other words , it is perfectly possible for citizens to gain access to this information .
we need to define what thelegislative capacityis .
my heart is with you , but I have to follow my head .
thank you very much for the extra time , mr president .
good luck , marco .
however , these debates do not include political group debates .
i support the rapporteur's proposal for improvements in connection with the annual report .
these authorities appoint officials to implement democratic decisions .
the fact that this happens nevertheless has two explanations .
the second explanation , however , is sound and involves a difficult balancing act .
there is a lot of internal resistance to quash .
i will vote for nearly everything contained in his proposal .
this is especially important now , as we approach the june elections to the european parliament .
citizens must be able to acquire a full understanding of our activities .
this is our route now and in the future .
otherwise we will end up knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing .
by this I mean that our workload is really quite broad .
otherwise some very valuable work that is not concentrated in parliament could be lost because it would be invisible .
i agree with michael cashman that all citizens should know how their ministers vote in council .
this is crucial .
this was also my experience .
however , although many people have internet access these days , not everyone does .
in the end , they will spend half the day writing a report about what they have done .
vice president of the commission . mr president , thank you for this debate and this discussion .
it is , of course , absolutely fundamental that they have access to information .
i think we are still struggling with that in some cases .
this is certainly a part of strengthening democracy in europe .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , I offer my very warm thanks to the commissioner .
the vote will take place on wednesday 14 january 2009 , at 12 noon .
written statements rule 142 
however , there is a general misconception on our revenues .
in future the council must ensure that all its debates , documents and information are open to public scrutiny .
it is not about greater arms expenditure , but about spending the existing money more wisely .
that is what we need to do .
we owe it to our taxpayers .
incidentally , we should be having this debate in brussels and not in strasbourg .
thank you .
the commission welcomes the text that we have now on the table .
it will give contracting authorities the flexibility they need to negotiate contracts which are often particularly complex and sensitive .
many elements from the 2004 procurement directive have been retained here .
we are in agreement with our national colleagues on this issue .
these are good enough reasons alone for the social democrats to accept the result .
we have succeeded in that .
i know he dedicated himself to this very important work .
mr president , commissioner , mr lambsdorff has done an excellent job .
this is especially true in the case of procurement for the army or defence forces .
i think that we will have to return to this subject .
i believe that the position presented in the proposal for a directive is correct .
last but not least , legal remedy can now be utilised for the first time .
this morning we celebrated 10 years of the euro .
this involves a large credit of trust that the member states have now become willing to give .
we need to go further along this road .
in fact , this translates a desire for integration of state sovereignties .
the same thing will be noted in the field of justice .
it certainly has nothing to do with strengthening defence capabilities .
this step is vital , in order to meet global challenges in the field of defence .
we should not forget an important element , namely the introduction of a control procedure .
it is also important that there are fundamental provisions governing the security of supply and information .
this is in the interests of bringing our industry together across europe .
at the same time , however , parliament has many reasons to be satisfied .
hence , it is to a large extent parliament's proposal .
we are convinced that this directive will make a difference and contribute to a real european defence market .
she said that these products are expensive through lack of competition .
no one can deny that this is the case .
defence ministers should be responsible for establishing implementation priorities .
we are going to deal with a series of questions addressed to the commission .
subject ten years of the euro
surveillance must build on the existing instruments .
the recovery plan recognises the inherent division of tasks embedded into the eu economic policy framework .
commissioner , I very much appreciate your reply .
how do you envisage new ways of trying to generate stimulus in economies of the eu countries ?
de commissioner , I am interested in the following point .
it could perhaps be one of the two member states with an opt out .
subject collapse in dairy prices on the eu market
i would also like to remind you of the situation back in 200this shows clearly that dairy producers are reacting to market signals .
with respect , your staff indicated that my request had been noted .
the commission is in favour of developing microcredit and microfinance institutions more generally .
my question to the commission is has an overall evaluation of this instrument been carried out ?
developing countries generally have extremely fragile policies on these things .
i am very happy to have at least two questions because we were asking for more interest from parliament .
the responsibilities of the member states are another important element .
a clearer allocation of responsibilities between member states and the commission is needed .
the third element is the rigidity of our budget .
we hope for the support of the parliament in these political discussions and later in negotiations with the council .
it is a very sensible question on cap in general .
that is how we probably will see the medium term future .
we tried to be as objective as possible .
so it is public it is available .
it is not yet our opinion .
negotiations on budget finalisation usually centre on juste retour negotiations .
they will be part of the political response that will follow later this year .
sv I have a short question to ask the commissioner .
i took part in the commission's excellent conference in december on the mid term review of the budget .
this is probably even more important than how much money we actually have or can inject .
the commission is now looking at how to update and implement these instruments .
i will conclude by saying that we must keep in mind that the internet is a global information network .
the european union cannot regulate it on its own .
i would like to ask you a supplementary question , commissioner .
madam president , I will answer mr aylward .
we have tried to promote and facilitate effective information sharing between the police forces of the various member states .
in particular , judge jean louis bruguière has been given the task of monitoring the swift terrorist finance tracking programme .
his findings will be available soon .
i have not heard anything about an opt out clause in this field .
pt mr barrot , I agree with you I agree with your dissatisfaction .
the truth is that illegal immigration to europe continues .
the trafficking of human beings continues .
the commission must carry on without losing its enthusiasm for this policy of cooperation and aid for member states .
has the commission encouraged member states to adopt a common position on this ?
the question about pharmacists was raised by mr angelakas .
there has been court jurisprudence on this particular matter .
there are various stages of proceedings against member states in this area .
the financial crisis shed a new light on cras .
since august 2007 the financial markets worldwide suffered from a major confidence crisis .
the credit rating agencies are close to the origin of the problems that have arisen with subprime markets .
the massive financial crisis occurred and now here you are telling us that we need a stricter legislative framework .
we do indeed need a stricter regulatory framework .
and that is what has occurred .
subject financial crisis
we need to demonstrate that europe can provide concrete answers .
this flexibility certainly does not mean any changes to the single market principles .
but there is a balance to be struck between being overly pessimistic and being realistic .
the next item is the commission statement on the pharmaceutical products package .
this also applies to protection against counterfeit medicines .
the rapidly growing numbers of fake medicines have forced us to act .
community wide access to information about undesirable or previously unknown side effects will make community wide risk management significantly easier .
finally , the pharmaceutical package includes a proposal for improved patient information .
patients are already actively searching for information .
in my opinion this situation is both dreadful and intolerable .
i hope that I will have the support of the european parliament for this package .
thank you very much .
but we are looking now at the three items that you have referred to .
counterfeiting is one of the curses of our age .
commissioner verheugen has rightly raised the fact that a number of amendments to the legislation are necessary .
supervision of a medicine is limited once it reaches the market .
anyone watching prime time television in the united states can see what trouble this can cause .
the legislative proposal relaxes the rules on the circulation of information via the internet and printed media .
i think that it is good to address environmental aspects , for example .
contamination from pharmaceutical products is a growing problem in treatment works .
i would therefore like us to tighten up the legislation in this area .
as regards the counterfeiting of medicines , this is probably also connected to our current patent system .
there is an extremely large difference in price .
manufacture would then be licence free .
finally , I would just like to say something about nanotechnology .
i would like better methods to be introduced for investigating the toxicology of nanoparticles .
this is perhaps not particularly strange , as pharmaceutical products affect everyone .
i do not want to see advertisements for prescription pharmaceutical products .
it is this part of the commission's proposal that I am quite dubious about .
the names are often different despite the fact that the medicines contain identical substances .
could there not be a way to simplify things for those who live in cross border regions ?
i have been critical of serious shortcomings in the veterinary medicines directive now for some time .
finally , I also have concerns with the role of drug companies in influencing doctorsprescription habits .
work on the database is going well and it will be available in the foreseeable future .
we will not permit this under any circumstances .
it must be authorised before it is published and it is subject to strict quality controls .
i must state clearly at this point that vaccines are , of course , not freely available .
however , this information was not available to them .
these statistics show that patient information can even save money .
i am thinking , for example , of the very well known publication apothekenumschau in my native country .
european approval is the exception , not the rule .
i think the structures are very different in these cases .
the debate is closed .
dangerous substances and preparations dichloromethane debate 
it is easy to be affected by it .
a proper protective set up consists of very high spec gloves that have to be changed every three hours .
that is why self contained breathing equipment is needed .
this was , in fact , the last chance before reach to ban chemicals in the old fashioned way .
we are now creating a market for the alternatives .
the marketing and use of dichloromethane by professionals will be subject to a general ban .
measures to minimise evaporation from containers of paint stripper must also be put in place .
mr schlyter recommends that you support the compromise text negotiated with the council .
i am therefore in a position to give my full support to the compromise on behalf of the commission .
this is a valid compromise and it is important to recognise that dichloromethane is responsible for many accidents .
i regret , moreover , that we have very little information on the accidents at work that have happened .
under normal temperatures their use causes them to evaporate to dangerous levels .
there is no effective way to ensure the safe use of dichloromethanes for the public .
these products can be used safely industrially in the right conditions .
i mentioned that I have a constituency interest in this .
i have been in correspondence with commissioner verheugen for seven years now on this issue .
some member states , such as sweden , denmark and austria , have already introduced a ban on dcm .
for this , I can but give high praise to our rapporteur , mr schlyter .
in the end , this is quite acceptable .
prove that environmental considerations take priority over the demands of the market in more cases than this single example .
economic factors should not be used as a reason for maintaining this poison in common use .
it has been a hard road to get to this .
he has talked about industrial lobbies .
he has also referred to an industrial lobby in his constituency , which successfully persuaded him of the alternative .
i think that this , among many other substances , poses a high risk .
it is potentially hazardous .
if it is misused there is a direct risk of death and this factor has implications for terrorism .
we are aware of very few accidents involving the alternative substances .
of course , the staff who have helped me to reach this agreement have also played an important role .
there has been no lack of clarity between the commission and me in relation to this issue .
i would just like to illustrate this chemical to you all .
i will take this opportunity to appeal to the commission to ensure that the regulations are complied with .
it damages the nervous system and causes serious damage to internal organs , which can directly lead to death .
withdrawing dcm from general circulation therefore seems to be the most sensible and responsible solution .
all european institutions support the generally recognised programme for decent work .
an important part of the commission's approach is its support for international work standards .
the areas of shared competence also cover several other themes .
this challenge will be supported by a review of the ratification situation performed by the council before january 20the difficulties in reconciling those positions are extremely complex .
fishermen out of work in ireland are denied social welfare payments and this creates great hardship .
i hope so .
the debate closed .
documents received see minutes
the next item is a statement by the council on the presentation of the czech presidency's programme .
i see only one way of fulfilling this task honourably .
the role of the country holding the presidency is neither to promote its interests nor to make decisions .
i shall always rigorously , decisively and correctly uphold that here .
i fundamentally disagree with this type of criticism .
finally , the issue of energy security once again demands our urgent attention .
in addition to our scheduled tasks we shall , like the french presidency , have to face new events .
further surprises can never be ruled out .
this vision gains new importance in today's troubled political and economic situation .
for anyone in need of exercise , 2 gs is plenty of exertion .
we have also led a european delegation to the area of the middle east conflict .
in the area of foreign trade , the presidency is focusing on a revival of discussions at the wto .
here , we attach great importance to successful completion of the doha development agenda dda .
i fully endorse this view .
naturally , we are also interested in diversifying the supply and transport routes .
we need to think seriously about developing safe nuclear energy .
while this priority is called energy , it is inseparably linked with climate protection policy .
such a consensus should also reflect current trends in the world economy .
last but not least , the priority of europe in the world includes the area of internal security .
i began by saying that the czech question is also a european question .
thank you for your attention .
with this package , we are able to take steps towards reaching an ambitious international agreement in december .
i shall come back to this .
you are still in the process of examining some very important proposals , ladies and gentlemen .
it is here where europe's citizens will feel most pressure this year .
the fact is that gazprom and naftogas are unable to fulfil their obligations towards european consumers .
i would like to convey a very clear message to moscow and kiev .
things are likely to get worse before becoming better .
rules to ensure that the benefits of european integration are shared out amongst citizens .
applause 
are we ready to release the budgetary resources needed to give us the means to conduct our policy ?
mr topolánek , you have rightly made the union's external relations one of your priorities .
he put that right , which is a good thing .
karel schwarzenberg says israel is acting in self defence , whilst louis michel says the country is violating international law .
prague castle was also the seat of charles iv , as the prime minister mentioned .
therefore , this period in prague castle was truly european .
applause 
your recipe will be contested , but not by liberals and democrats .
currently , our monitors are blocked from ukrainian dispatch centres .
applause 
we support them .
i hope that the czech republic presidency will address this in the coming months .
america will have a new president next week and we all have major challenges ahead of us .
certainly we must regulate the financial markets soon .
i know you have the capacity to meet those challenges .
to sum up , this is a programme that reveals a world with many dangers and few opportunities .
yet the czech presidency is pursuing restrained objectives and sensible priorities , and will be very successful .
you see , we have experience in one other area too .
it is simply evil , and you can change it .
that is , freedom , prosperity , competitiveness and security , not euro health , euro taxes , euro parks and euro beer .
that happens to be my personal view of it .
this 60 year conflict has solved nothing .
independence requires that we have a good mix of various energy sources .
this is a requirement of security for our continent .
fr madam president , europe's credibility is at stake with regard to the energy issue .
to do that , we have to act together .
it is scandalous to see such a small proportion of the structural funds being invested in something useful !
there is also the turkish issue .
you have spoken of mobilising those countries which share your liberal economic outlook to oppose protectionism at this time .
good luck .
your activity will become even more difficult with the rising political tensions related to the european election campaign .
the end of your presidency will be marked by the election of 532 new meps .
i underline this figure because it is not the one foreseen in the treaty of lisbon .
do more to put the european economy back on track while preserving people's jobs .
this will not be possible if there is no unity within your own country .
the second prerequisite is to unite behind you the main political parties in this parliament .
this is something to be learned from the french presidency .
finally , I would like to draw attention to the rise of extremism , anti semitism and xenophobia in europe .
i wish you every success .
however , I will draw attention to some issues that I hope your presidency can address .
firstly , the motto you have chosen iseurope without barriers.
i hope that you will honour your commitment to reach a first reading agreement with my roaming ii report .
thank you , and I wish you the best of luck during your presidency .
applause 
applause 
as an irish member , I should like to thank the czech government and people .
you have spelled out an ambitious programme to deal with these .
it also requires respect for the peoples of those member states to have any hope of success .
such respect bodes well for your presidency and for europe .
the treaty of lisbon is an excellent instrument for correcting any wrong turns taken by europe .
i am of course talking about president václav havel .
in any case , europe's freezing citizens understand what needs to be done .
the consequences of the communist regime's crimes are a repulsive scar on the face of europe .
ukraine's gas supply is cut off and russian tanks enter georgia .
two of the three main priorities of the czech presidency energy and the eastern partnership need gas .
we need you to design a comprehensive and decisive strategy .
cs making europe sweeter !
the reform treaty is essential .
fourthly , can the czech presidency really have authority unless and until the czech republic ratifies the treaty ?
in 1618 , an unpleasant habsburg diplomatic mission came to hradčany whose behaviour was unprecedentedly arrogant .
that is what europe's citizens are expecting , and you will not succeed by listening to these charlatans .
you should still be able to correct the german version .
thank you very much .
you made an undertaking to ratify the treaty of lisbon by the end of 200you did not and that was wrong .
happily , the polls indicate ayesmajority .
now , this will only be possible with the treaty of lisbon .
that europe gave its neighbours , including those in central and eastern europe , the prospect of accession .
it seems to be well prepared .
commission president barroso said that the eu is being put to the test in these six months .
these tests can be passed only if we all give of our best .
the european union is a community of values and a common system of law .
the czech president describes the climate change package as a silly luxury .
however , it would be a big mistake to turn away before addressing the long term causes of this problem .
the aim of the eu must therefore be to keep ukraine on the union's radar screen .
the czech presidency's priorities include energy security and reinforcement of the eastern partnership .
that is not only untrue , it is divisive and it is a breach of trust .
sv madam president , I , too , would like to welcome the czech presidency .
during this presidency , we will have low growth and unemployment will rise .
if europe is to be able to compete in future , we must invest in modern environmental technology .
this will provide a higher rate of growth and increased employment .
it is a similar situation with social policy .
this is why I believe that we need sustainable solutions in the energy sector .
we need a common european energy policy .
the need for concrete action aimed at establishing a common european energy policy is now greater than ever .
i wish the czech presidency every success .
i wish us all a successful czech presidency , notwithstanding the pluralism of our views .
they do not accept education systems which send them to the market of unemployment and social disdain .
they have a problem with the ratification of the treaty of lisbon .
it is the new generation that can understand what is meant by .
you mentioned the free movement of knowledge .
nowhere is that more important than in medical science , and that goes , too , for mental health .
i know you will do your best in that , and I wish you well in all your endeavours .
the czech republic is the first country of central and eastern europe to take the eu presidency .
if the documents are not credible , that fact should be drawn to the attention of the country concerned .
and what is a possible solution ?
when slovakia is eliminated from the ice hockey world championship and the czech republic qualifies for the next round .
madam president , I would like to extend the warmest estonian support for the czech presidency .
together we can reach an agreement at first reading on the directive on energy efficiency in buildings .
so , you must make up your mind eu or us ?
this realistic approach inspires optimism , and shows respect for democracy and the principle of unanimity .
on behalf of the delegation .
the president cut off the speaker . 
each country has its own tools and rules of the game for achieving ratification .
besides , we began to address the gas issue in mid december , during the french presidency .
my government is the first government that will meet the maastricht criteria .
i do not look on this as a race .
we must look for the tools to overcome a number of technical problems .
this is not a european dispute , although it is in fact starting to interfere with the accession talks .
we also appreciate the fact that we can tackle many problems .
what we value most of all is the internal liberal debate .
i would like to use this time to answer some concrete questions put to me , specifically on energy .
yes , we need more solidarity and more progress in terms of energy security in europe .
applause 
many of you spoke about the czech presidency and how important it is .
i am sorry but the czech republic is not a small country , even in european terms .
i wish the czech presidency all the best .
president klaus has been quite right to compare the european union to the old soviet union .
i wholeheartedly wish our southern neighbour a successful presidency !
in this respect , the union ought to maximise its efforts in facilitating access to available resources .
however , it has now become so militarised that humanitarian issues have now come to the fore .
not just the hamas militants who triggered the military conflict , but innocent children , women and men .
jews and palestinians can live peacefully side by side .
it has also resulted in significant economic losses , as the gas is also needed in manufacturing .
i cordially wish our czech friends success in bringing the aims of the eu to fruition .
indeed , these are social and economic problems at a european level that transcend borders .
on the contrary it could serve to deepen the economic and social problems facing us .
similar regulations apply in other european states too .
the czech republic holding the presidency of the council provides a good opportunity to re examine these statements .
it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a point of order .
in any case , deaf journalists may have some difficulty if you announce the results .
mr president , I agree with the position that mr speroni has put forward .
i recognise the difficulty you are in , but I would suggest that he is right .
to read out every amendment result would be very time consuming especially with a vote like we have today .
applause 
we will therefore move on to the vote .
situation of fundamental rights in the european union 2004 2008 
before the vote on the first part of paragraph 32
i will not go into the details , but the authentic version is the english version .
development of the un human rights council , including the role of the eu 
the next item is the vote .
we had wished to simplify things for you , but it is not possible .
better passports alone are not enough .
these are legal immigrants , semi legal immigrants but also illegal immigrants .
bg thank you , mr president .
i think it is time we drew attention to this .
cs the european arms market operates inefficiently because it is fragmented .
i hope that it will be very soon indeed , mr president !
fishermen face the highest incidence of serious occupational accidents and deaths .
this is a period when we should act together and avoid any moves that might undermine our unity .
the key idea of integrating eu countries must not be forgotten , not to mention ignored or rejected .
the european parliament does not , in other words , accept games with territorial and regional autonomy .
the report assumes an overly one sided political view of human rights in the union .
this is why I voted against catania's report .
unfortunately , this has not been so in several of the new eu member states in recent times .
in view of the intolerant climate in which part of this debate was held , it would seem so .
i see that he is applauding .
i suggest that this report could have done more for areas of disability that need more work .
so I could not support the overall report .
i am very much opposed to the charter of fundamental rights .
therefore the uk independence party meps voted against this report .
i agree with what has been said by mrs kinga gál .
i reject the notion that religious leaders should be restricted in their freedom of conscience and religion concerning homosexuality .
mr president , today we have just voted on the situation of fundamental rights in the european union .
that is why we abstained at the end of this vote .
last but not least , syed kamall !
i hope to remember them evermore .
of course this means a substantial expense running into millions of euros but one cannot compromise with security measures .
this report makes a hesitant step in that direction .
a strict , recurrent review of data security is therefore indispensable .
how old are the murdered palestinian children ?
such an exception is to be warmly welcomed .
taking fingerprints also comes at a price .
a visa will soon set you back eur at any rate , I take issue with the excessive use of fingerprinting or the use of biometric data .
is this not more trouble than it is worth ?
finally , I agree with the introduction into the law of a review procedure .
the protection of human health must prevail over industrial interests .
this substance is classified as a category 3 carcinogenic agent .
various alternatives to dcm based strippers are already available on the market .
i consider it imperative to apply european measures to prohibit or replace this substance .
i voted in favour of the report .
for these reasons , we are unable to vote in favour of this report .
moreover , family law is a member state competence and not an area of eu jurisdiction .
member states with legislation on same sex partnerships should move to recognise provisions with similar effects adopted by other states .
this ruling demanded that the pmoi should be taken off the eu terror list .
the situation is also similar in the other eu countries lithuanians have emigrated to .
for these reasons I voted for the 45th amendment .
in many respects I admire my own group's basic positions .
with reference to point 61 , however , I would like to say this .
separate issues arise , however , in relation to this report and this debate .
a debate on these is interesting .
violations have been identified , revealed , including for example in closed establishments accommodating children and elderly people .
the eu must follow the uk's lead and remove the pmoi from the terrorist list .
in many eu countries citizens , in particular the weakest ones , children are affected by discrimination and poverty .
i served on the temporary committee into extraordinary rendition by the cia .
i therefore voted to abstain on this report .
a positive attitude to abortion is inconceivable to me .
i voted in favour of the report .
i believe that human rights and democracy are key elements in the eu's external relations and external policy .
the commission was widely discredited due to several of its member countries having very dubious human rights records .
unfortunately , the positive elements are too few and far between .
the committee on foreign affairs also regrets the growing division of the unhrc into regional blocs .
none , of course .
thus , the existence of places of dialogue must be a policy to be stimulated and promoted .
it is above all to set out potential improvements in its operations .
the death penalty is a matter of conscience for each conservative mep .
finally , I hope that all this can be achieved by the end of this parliamentary term .
however , I would like to highlight one aspect .
the european council takes major political decisions and discusses very important and controversial issues .
the rapporteur , however , draws no distinction between these procedures .
in writing . nl I emphatically voted in favour of this report .
in writing . de I rejected this report .
the demands it makes go way beyond what I understand by transparency .
it is important to preserve legal protection of personality for meps , too .
in the interests of greater transparency , eu institutions should respect the principle of multilingualism .
i wish you a very warm welcome too , commissioner .
there are also extensive food shortages at all levels of the population .
the european union has been closely following the tragic events from the outset .
israel suffered through periodic rocket fire and the knowledge that its foe was amassing greater firepower .
we need to address broader and more complicated challenges .
unfortunately , we face a terrible and appalling conflict in gaza , which is now in its third week .
war , unfortunately , always produces immense human suffering , and this war is no exception .
second , we stressed the urgent humanitarian needs , which we said had to be met .
we think it is very important that very soon something works .
military operations can never bring a lasting peace only a negotiated political agreement can do this .
possibly it will come out debilitated militarily , but strengthened politically .
as the un secretary general has just reminded us , both sides must comply with this resolution .
applause 
it is a bloody conflict , and women and children are suffering particularly as a result of it .
it is entitled to defend itself against people whose aim it is to destroy the state .
a fundamental adjustment is needed , therefore .
there will have to be dialogue with hamas .
what was possible then can be possible also in future .
applause from the left 
applause 
the more civilian deaths , the more palestinian deaths , the less security in the region !
that there is the drama , the tragedy that is currently taking place in that region .
mr schulz is right israel needs to be protected from itself !
israel needs to be saved from the temptation of a solution that involves war and armed force .
it is not easy , but we must be clear .
free the palestinians from the israeli occupation of the west bank and the palestinians will free themselves from hamas .
applause 
a cease fire is what we want !
i think it is important , and that it is a strong message .
many thanks , mrs morgantini .
i would in this respect refer you to the lucid report in last monday's frankfurter allgemeine .
it is not the war that must be won today , but peace .
applause 
two or three hundred and how many israeli civilians ?
we must set out strict conditions to accompany the peace and development process in the middle east .
the answer is most certainlyno.
this was a tragic mistake !
applause 
for 17 days , they have been facing the enormous israeli war machine that is flagrantly violating international law .
i also express support for the peace forces in israel calling for an end to this war .
the un security council has adopted a resolution .
use the clauses in the association agreements .
i repudiate the propaganda of terrorism .
it is bordering on a humanitarian disaster and it requires immediate action .
by taking this position , we helped to destroy this joint government .
why are they voting for hamas ?
yes , the hamas rockets must stop .
israel is entitled to protect itself , but it has gone too far with these attacks .
we wish him every success with this important duty and with the challenge ahead of him .
mr obama is also taking this line as he says that he will talk to iran .
that is the result , the collateral damage of this attack on gaza .
we are here today to demand a cease fire and an end to the slaughter of civilians .
mr president , what is happening in gaza is heartbreaking .
that the devastation is perpetuated by a supposedly western nation is unfathomable .
there is no excuse there is no possible justification .
commissioner , we must vigorously and authoritatively take up the leadership in order to bring about peace .
the union for the mediterranean must play a major role , as must the euro mediterranean parliamentary assembly .
today , it is muslim public opinion , which extends far beyond the geography of the arab states .
there are all the un resolutions and the geneva conventions as well , however .
there will never be security without peace , or peace without justice .
when it comes to international law , there is no such thing as aget out of jail freecard .
the first is that an overwhelming majority of this parliament wants to bring about a quick ceasefire .
i strongly object to anyone trying to demonise a nation .
the conflict we are discussing today is an asymmetrical conflict .
today we are condemning israel .
it has something to condemn , it has authorities .
it is easy for us to talk , but very hard to take effective action .
ladies and gentlemen , would you want a terrorist organisation to fire 7 000 missiles from israel into gaza ?
he has until 5.20 p.m. at the latest , I have been told .
being a general , mr morillon will set a good example .
neither should the constant threat under which israeli children live be allowed .
but is there any other solution ?
the western powers did not create two states in 1948 , but they should do so now .
let us be more courageous in this strategy .
sl the israeli state has ordered the israeli army to destroy hamas in gaza .
and how can a ceasefire be achieved when neither party recognises the other's legitimacy ?
the road to lasting peace leads only through political negotiations .
we , from the comfort of our television sets , feel nauseated watching them .
we can no longer leave the fate of the civilians in the hands of the opposing sides .
israel is bombing and decimating a ghetto .
in this way , peace is being killed , and therefore we need to stop israel .
i address this comment to the president in office of the council , and to our fine commissioner , representing europe .
however , in the case of israel , we confine ourselves to statements and fruitless discussion .
we cannot be bystanders because that makes us complicit in the slaughter .
iran's foreign policy objective is to become the dominant regional power in the middle east .
it should be implemented without delay .
this is an issue of respect for international humanitarian law .
it is an issue of proportionality .
so they should .
our shame and also indignation are at so many lies , so much ambiguity and so much hot air .
when israel took non violent action , such as imposing blockades or cutting electricity , it was castigated .
we must consider each child's life to be of equal value , on either side of the border .
the israeli response is totally disproportionate and the deaths of young children are particularly shameful .
i have not , to date , opposed the new eu israel agreement .
in the last months , hamas still definitely behaved as a terrorist organisation .
i have seen it in africa .
i have seen it in ireland .
i have seen it in many places .
but first of all they have to stop acting as a terrorist organisation .
first of all , those who are on the spot will tell us clearly what they need .
this basically deals with how to organise peace and what is necessary .
our plan is based on what we found out then and discussed with our partners .
clearly , the eu alone cannot resolve this .
reawaken your basic humanity and you will see why hamas gains strength .
not only that , but hamas has consistently declined to recognise israel's right to exist .
palestinians need urgent access to food , medical aid and security .
israel must , at the very least , respect the principles of international law .
perhaps it can do so if it takes stronger measures than it has done so far .
so we are able to exercise that role .
is such action consistent with our own eu values of justice and democracy ?
this is probably the most important debate in which I have taken part .
da mr president , I just want to say two things .
i welcome the czech presidency , its priorities and its immediate and active involvement in the region .
the long term solution is a protected , secure israeli state , along with a sustainable palestinian state .
even before the recent immoral attacks , we saw years of collective punishment of the palestinian people .
both parties see only their own interest that is national egotism .
we are waiting here .
has it been deleted from the agenda ?
it is on the list of terrorist organisations and it is difficult to take action against it .
there is movement in any case .
i am committed to that as long as I am a member of this middle east quartet .
the debate is closed .
one news agency told a story of two children who were about to cross the road in gaza .
sadly , these shocking numbers will increase .
what will it take to have peace ?
how many civilian casualties will it take before there can be a true ceasefire ?
since that time it has not been possible to remember these victims together with the majority population .
at the very least , we need to join together to remember the victims .
un facilities have been attacked .
gas supplies by russia to ukraine and the eu debate 
the council and the commission were aware of the potential problem .
a further meeting of the gas coordination group on monday 19 january now looks likely .
allow me also to make a couple of final remarks in that introductory statement .
the dispute is not over yet , as we all know .
furthermore the eu needs to diversify its gas resources and supply routes .
this mechanism has had a considerable effect in mitigating the effects of the crisis .
the difference is that those oil crises were global while this is very clearly an eu crisis .
but I would like to stress particularly two issues that should be addressed immediately 
so I believe it is high time the gas flowed again towards the european union in stable conditions .
our group , the ppe de group , has supported this idea from the very beginning .
some of our recommendations have been addressed albeit belatedly in the commission's second strategic energy review .
this would not have done us any good , and indeed it is not doing us any good now .
these things will not happen overnight , but signals must be sent out .
we need many more interconnectors and interconnections .
the same is true of the gas reserves , of course .
we have to make common cause in this regard .
enough of this !
we cannot allow europe to be an innocent victim of a cynical power play .
we liberals have long been demanding a significant reduction of our dependence , our energy dependence , on russia .
now the european union is also being put to the test before its citizens .
let us not deceive ourselves russia is not concerned with a few dollars .
i hope that the plans the commissioner has presented will bear fruit .
there is now a need and a use for such people .
it is the price of our fanatical rejection of nuclear energy .
agreeing a level of how many dayssupply constitutes a reasonable reserve would be a good start .
there are huge savings to be achieved .
nl mr president , I can endorse the view of many fellow members .
we know that gas supplies are re negotiated every year , because ukraine and russia work with one year contracts .
russia and ukraine have dealt themselves and their reputations heavy blows .
what is obvious is that both countries have little awareness when it comes to customer friendliness .
however , gazprom has recently issued a demand for a huge price increase to unrealistic levels .
this means that unlike petroleum , there is no free market for gas in europe .
however , we do not know the facts of the situation .
the situation is also evidence of the european union's deficient energy policy .
the use of coal is opposed under environmental pretences .
to put it briefly , two parties two truths , no gas .
commissioner , I thank you for your proposals and efforts to find a solution .
de mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this is a dramatic situation , as we know .
how many times has russia attracted attention in this regard ?
i think that mr swoboda was right to ask this question .
what have we done to increase our support for nuclear power ?
the answer is far too little , far too timidly .
what have we done in the field of lng ?
we have the political capacity for that and we have need of cooperation .
it is a serious situation , as has been said .
sv mr president , the eu is the world's largest economic power .
now , as never before , it is clear that the eu must reduce its dependence on russian gas .
moreover , neither state was shown the expected path to membership in nato and the european union .
a compromise must be reached , gas supplies must be restarted , if russia has enough reserves to supply .
thank you .
but the other option we have at the moment is directly dependent on the will of the commission .
all these disputes combined place us in the middle of an energy war , which is about power sharing .
we need rules for a free energy market shared by our russian and ukrainian partners .
sanctions cannot work .
we managed to lower temperatures in europe and bring in a winter that has affected the entire continent .
no matter whether the reasons are technical , financial or political , this unprecedented gas embargo cannot be justified .
one other thing on energy solidarity .
firstly we must reduce dependency on gas , more and more of which will have to be imported .
this implies much improved and extended grids and pipelines .
what is the timing for this , commissioner piebalgs ?
this debate should send out a clear signal to russia and ukraine to immediately reinstate gas supplies .
both of these will result in our diversifying supply routes and exporting countries .
commissioner , your diagnosis of a lack of interconnection could not be more accurate .
we have to work on this , as it is , indeed , something we can do something about .
we have to interconnect the gas networks within the eu .
one of the main reasons this has not been done is that the licences are national .
ladies and gentlemen , commissioners , it is clear what we have to do .
the world is changing , and it simply needs to accept this fact .
the citizens of ukraine should not suffer just because their politicians have failed .
his political tone is too calm .
both are responsible !
hu madam president , I suggest that we speak clearly .
the present crisis is not only a test of our common energy policy , but also of eu solidarity .
i am going to give you an example where the council does not do that .
you must answer the european citizens as to why they are now sitting in the cold .
president in office of the council . madam president , firstly let me offer my apologies to you .
this is not a subject of the current debate we are discussing the emergency situation .
why not buy gas on the ukrainian russian border ?
but today , for example , we said that legal action must follow here .
that would help us to speak with one voice in a more active way .
secondly , for two years we have had energy diplomacy .
this is my second point .
we really should discuss how to guarantee security of supply under all possible conditions .
the vote will take place tomorrow thursday 15 january 2009 .
written statements rule 142 
the european union is facing , once again , a crisis with its supply of natural gas .
ukraine ?
we must expedite the process of diversifying supply sources and transit routes for natural gas .
in fact , accelerating the nabucco project is vital .
we must learn from the present crisis .
secondly , the gas crisis shows the political weakness of a divided , hesitant european union .
when under big pressure eu national governments rely , basically , on their own resources and sources .
as for oil stocks we should develop gas storage .
decision makers reacted to the turning off of the gas taps as if this had been completely unexpected .
we do not even need to know the real reasons behind russia's behaviour to draw our conclusions .
will the ideological opponents of atomic energy change their views ?
let us hope so .
we need to agree on a practical common policy on solidarity , security and diversification in energy .
the consequences of this crisis are humanitarian and economic .
we must start building the nabucco gas pipeline without delay .
everything has a positive side too , however .
i hope the spokesman is successful in strengthening that understanding .
i encourage the eu to diversify its energy package to avoid its dependence on one single natural gas provider .
i ask why should not it ?
this was reaffirmed by the reaction to russia's legitimate decision to suspend gas supplies .
if not , there is something wrong with integration .
russia has joined in the election campaign that is underway there .
so we should not delude ourselves this is only the start of the struggle for influence in ukraine .
without technical coordination between the two sides , gas cannot be supplied .
subject the rule of law and the judicial system in russia
the eu needs the new agreement , but so does russia .
moreover , my country has set three priority areas for its presidency of the council .
president in office of the council . I can give you a short answer yes !
with all these elections going on and changes of administration , how can we really kick start the wto talks ?
one of the priorities of the czech presidency is the common agricultural policy .
what measures will be taken by the czech presidency to negotiate the future of the common agricultural policy ?
ga madam president , I would like to thank the president in office for his answer .
quality of life also means , however , healthy food .
we did not have this five to ten years ago .
it is a question of elementary justice in the system , and it should be corrected .
at the same time , we believe that the cap should be reformed .
this is the only way to keep europe competitive .
i am sorry , minister , I was not sure if you had addressed both questions .
president in office of the council . I was trying to respond to both questions .
situation in the horn of africa debate 
there are several sources of tension in the horn of africa .
i will get to them in more detail .
another serious issue is the competition for natural resources such as water and minerals in the horn of africa .
there are also serious regional interdependencies .
i would also stress that improved regional cooperation would contribute to lowering tensions around national boundaries .
food security is another interdependency .
once again , regional cooperation could mitigate the effects of these natural events .
the pretext of the pirates was to levy a fishing tax on a ship in somali waters .
what is our engagement or involvement ?
this dialogue is principally pursued through the heads of the eu missions in the countries concerned .
this particularly concerns matters of governance and human rights .
i will let commissioner ferrero waldner elaborate further on that because that is the commission's responsibility .
i look forward to hearing your proposals and recommendations on this particular issue .
the commission will also continue to monitor the human rights situation and the democratisation process .
the commission remains seriously concerned about human rights violations and the precarious social and economic situation .
indeed , 2009 is a decisive year for the future of this country .
the sudanese authorities must respect their obligations as regards the facilitation of humanitarian aid and human rights activities .
failing to do so could turn the planned elections of 2009 into a scenario of renewed violence and conflict .
in somalia , the peace process is in a crucial phase .
the importance of this region transcends purely geographical bounds .
the conflicts and structural problems there are compounded by the negative phenomena in other regions of africa .
this practice is illogical , and makes diplomatic success practically impossible .
no developing country can work properly in the modern world if it rejects fundamental , universal values .
they create humanitarian disasters and paralyse the development of this strategically significant region .
each war , each conflict accentuates the fragility of the states .
this force needs a decent un mandate .
if not , ugandan and burundian forces will pull away from mogadishu leaving a security gap behind .
there is a momentum for change now in somalia that should be taken advantage of .
we must all have a common interest in a successful operation atalanta .
i also think that the horn of africa is possibly the poorest region in the world .
he was imprisoned without trial and , more than seven years later , has still not been formally charged .
the time for silent diplomacy is past .
enough is enough .
the european parliament is today demanding that dawit isaak and the other journalists imprisoned in eritrea be released immediately .
well , it was working for democracy and for the freedom of speech .
mr president , the horn of africa is pretty much an unmitigated disaster .
human rights are abused as a matter of course .
alarmingly , the situation could easily deteriorate further .
we have also debated the epidemic of piracy off the somali coast .
the people of somaliland benefit from a relatively benign government and progressive institutions .
the chances of the european union and the international community changing the basic reality in somalia are slight .
however , tackling one of its consequences , piracy , is much more within our grasp .
first I think I can assure you that , under the czech presidency , there will be continuity .
we will rather try to pursue the policy established by our predecessor in the best possible manner .
here the commission will provide full political , but also strong financial , support to the djibouti process .
we are very concerned about these tremendous challenges .
the participation of belarus will depend on its domestic development .
we need to see progress on media freedom , including internet freedom and the accreditation of foreign journalists .
progress is , however , a two way street .
a further issue for reflection is the potential to open negotiations on visa facilitation and a readmission agreement .
this would comprise the unblocking of the pca and a significant increase in our assistance .
this , however , will not be a one way street .
we might also mention the future opening of a european union representation .
i think that the european union should also go down the road of mutual understanding .
several such power plants are planned for the region in lithuania , estonia and poland .
the ball , as they say , is in minsk's court .
we cannot turn our backs on belarus .
today there is no permanent employment outside government structures everybody works on one year contracts only .
the eastern partnership initiative also opens new opportunities for the present authorities in belarus .
no .
in october , we decided to suspend the entry ban for president lukashenko .
experience has taught us that all dictatorships come to an end !
moreover , the several monthstrial period is drawing to a close .
today we are experiencing a fundamental change in the situation .
the true values at stake are energy , money and military strategy .
it is appropriate that the eu should make use of the current , albeit meagre , opportunities .
our task is to support and help unite the ngos and the opposition fighting for change .
as a result , a permanent representation of the european commission has been set up in minsk .
these are positive signals which without doubt are also the result of the european union's attitude to belarus .
it is not a liberal democracy in the european meaning of the word .
pl mr president , eu belarus relations depend on both sides .
the belarus resolution passed last year emphasised the need for a firm and conditional , yet positive policy .
no democratic country can function without a strong civil society .
an expensive visa and strict regulations do not punish the regime , but the population .
arrests and searches of the offices of opposition activists and human rights activists continue .
i have , with my colleagues , added paragraph 10 to the present european parliament resolution to this effect .
these should include a requirement for greater media freedom .
the media must be free to operate within the law and publish their material in the country .
however , we cannot stop fighting for the values on which the european union is founded .
the policy of sanctions against belarus started out as a fiasco .
progress can be seen in terms of the declarations made by the european union's members .
it is time to make a summary of the discussion .
firstly , on visa fees , which many of you have mentioned .
this is a problem of which we are particularly aware .
the presidency will also encourage a more coherent application of the existing rules by the member states .
i just can say that visa fees and visas for children are specific to each and every country .
we are not yet at the point of having one general agreement .
that , again , would have to be negotiated by the commission .
alexander milinkievich's opposition movementfor freedomhas finally been registered .
belarus has expressed willingness to participate in the eastern partnership .
commemorating 11 july as a day of remembrance for the victims of the massacre in srebrenica debate 
it is without a doubt the worst atrocity in europe since the second world war .
the eu will keep doing everything in its power to make this happen .
a lot of good endeavours have been carried out .
the commission fully supports the work of the international criminal tribunal for yugoslavia , the icty .
this is at the heart of our eu's efforts in the western balkans .
war , concentration camps , genocide never again !
we owe this at least , and the conviction of the perpetrators , to the victims and their families .
we are all aware of the carnage that occurred in srebrenica in 199a bosnian court heard last month from psychologists about how survivors of the srebrenica massacre are intensely traumatised .
srebrenica is synonymous with the ruthless and inhumane killing of children and adults it is synonymous with genocide .
i believe that not only mladić but also the other guilty parties must stand trial .
srebrenica is also a symbol for the failure of optimistic notions about humanitarian interventions and safe havens .
it should have been made clear from the start that a foreign military presence could only offer false illusions .
i do not want to go anywhere .
srebrenica , july 199 bg thank you , mr president .
we must all stop defending a unilateral position and applying double standards when assessing such horrifying events .
what have we yet to see and what is there still to say about srebrenica ?
it is something I will never , ever forget .
we have that helplessness and hopelessness that we perhaps shared .
i will never forget the mothers , the daughters , the families that I met over that period .
i hope that we can deliver something lasting and positive to them for the future .
thousands of women , children and elderly people were deported and a large number of women were raped .
i believe that all countries of the western balkans will support the recognition of this day .
our esdp mission in bosnia and herzegovina continues to provide support and assistance to the icty and relevant authorities .
we all thought that safe havens would be safe havens .
closure of the sitting
in many ways , I want to concentrate this morning on the fact that we have legislation in place .
therefore , we have much to do on this .
therefore , I cannot , as I have said , emphasise this enough .
can the commission give an account of which member states have forwarded their reports ?
will the commission consequently prepare a report on enforcement processes of the regulation in the member states ?
most member states have already submitted reports on animal transportation in 2007 to the commission .
this prevents a comparison of the data reported by the various countries .
in your speech , you described animals being transported for slaughter as of low value .
this is something I would very much like to know .
it is also important that we achieve proper enforcement of the legislation .
however , we should go further still .
we should not simply talk about a time limit .
i would like to know how this rest station project is progressing .
the point is that these long distance transports increase costs which are , ultimately , passed on to the consumer .
this was an area in which we were to improve the situation .
we need to revisit the conditions for animals during transport .
however , these long journeys also result in poorer quality meat .
this is not currently being done .
more and more animals are being transported within the eu .
they will , of course , be very much higher .
i would also like to ask mr špidla a couple of questions .
the problem is journey times .
that is what we need to address .
i am also talking about the transportation of horses .
mr president , following that may not be easy !
the commission , let us recall , failed to get its way in the 2005 regulation .
what figures do you have ?
what is the situation with regard to implementation ?
for example , what additional professional training in transport matters should trained farmers be undergoing ?
that , too , requires some thought .
these questions should be discussed and answered in further debates .
it is precisely in large companies that the worst kinds of animal abuse take place .
mr president , it is very important that animals are transported to ensure safety and to prevent avoidable suffering .
there is no possibility of taking an animal out to graze in the middle of the channel .
should we not make night time transport obligatory in the latter case ?
we have perhaps too many already that are choking the sector that is complying with them .
mr president , I would like to congratulate mr parish on bringing this forward .
mrs jensen spoke of 24 hours transport not necessarily .
mr allister , the agricultural industry has to ask questions itself .
to my mind , it makes no economic sense . it does not make humanitarian sense .
that would be in the interests of animal welfare and of human health .
horses , like people , feel apprehension , fear , and are able to trust humans .
he quite simply trusted her .
the owner beats the horse .
secondly , monitoring remains the achillesheel of this legislation .
monitoring by europe leaves something to be desired and is still very much organised at national level .
for me , that is an indication that the legislation is being applied very differently by the member states .
this makes you wonder whether these animals were to be transported in a ferrari .
i would therefore like to urge the european commission to look into this .
i know the commission can access that , but individuals cannot .
i submit that things have not really improved over the last 10 or 20 years .
guaranteeing the welfare of animals is something that is very important .
recurrent serious problems with animal transport are due to gross breaches of the law .
is it possible to enforce this legislation when there is international transport of animals ?
it is www.8hours.eu.
this care requires ..
the president cut off the speaker 
we should assess the situation in specific member states .
we should remember that this all has an impact on costs and on productive competitiveness .
the citizens of the european union are very sensitive ..
i would like to try and answer some specific questions .
the debate is closed .
mediterranean diet debate 
what is the mediterranean diet ?
recent medical research has also suggested it may help cut the risk of conditions such as dementia .
it is something that we need to take seriously in a world where everything seems to be uniform .
we in europe would do well to draw attention to the healthiest diet , namely the mediterranean diet .
its main component as the commissioner has already said is olive oil .
cattle produce methane , and that is bad for the global climate .
produce must return to being natural and free from additives and chemical preservatives .
the commission's white paper on obesity identified the mediterranean diet as an excellent natural medicine .
the president cut off the speaker 
good diet is especially important in children .
in my opinion , the location was decided correctly and reasonably .
this is a good start to the year in our plenary sittings .
restoring ntdtv television broadcasts to china via eutelsat written declaration 
budgetary control of eu funds in afghanistan 
when armed hostilities escalate such that international institutions are no longer secure , the situation is extremely serious .
loud applause 
before the vote 
pt I would like to propose a new paragraph before paragraph 1 that states as follows 
eu strategy towards belarus vote 
before the vote concerns paragraph 9 
for results and other details of the vote see minutes 
i welcome this european parliament resolution .
that is most important of all .
there is no obligation on employers to produce plans .
everything that was criticised therefore no longer appears in the resolution adopted and I wanted to make this clear .
only let us not stop half way this applies both to belarus and the european union .
i think there are no longer sufficient reasons to retain the system of sanctions in dealings with belarus .
written explanations of vote
we oppose the treaty of lisbon in principle .
our presence only prolongs the war and the resulting suffering , rather than eliminating them .
europeans must withdraw as quickly as possible from the afghan waspsnest .
there is continuing conflict or war , as well as tribal and international clashes , drug trading and corruption .
as a result , afghanistan needs international aid .
i would like to express my support for aid to afghanistan .
the eu needs to continue the support being given to afghanistan .
in writing . ukip fully supports equality for men and women .
during this current economic crisis , women are among those most affected by unemployment or salary cuts .
civil society organisations also have an important role to play in this .
trade unions should play an important role in this field .
unfortunately , exaggerated declarations and claims were passed in committee .
in writing . sv discrimination and harassment have no place in a liberal society .
it should not be just the committee on women's rights which raises these issues .
before we can look for a solution , hamas must stop its rocket attacks on israel .
president pöttering has been hasty in asserting that there were no votes against .
moreover , the only thing that this offensive will achieve is to intensify the conflict .
as well as their concomitant violence , two images from the demonstrations against the israeli intervention were particularly shocking .
in view of the seriousness of the situation in gaza , the european parliament could not remain silent .
lip service is insufficient in the face of such a severe humanitarian crisis .
we therefore remained opposed to the vote in support of israel's increased participation in community programmes .
this is totally unacceptable and must stop .
your actions mean that you have become the aggressor , not the victim .
thank you , mr president .
the situation in the horn of africa continues to be extremely concerning .
the delicate situation in this african region means that european institutions must take a decisive stance .
in writing . belarus remains largely ostracised by the european union due to president lukashenko's authoritarian rule .
this represents an explicit recognition that human rights and political freedoms are suppressed in belarus .
it has also been pointed out , though , that other dissidents are still behind bars .
legislation should also be changed and belarusians should be given freedom of movement .
or is it perhaps commercial considerations that stop us from doing this ?
the european union has greater expectations .
there is a need for symmetry and understanding between the partners in many fields .
this is understandable .
realism is an integral part of foreign policy .
however , realism cannot , need not and should not be divorced from values and strategy .
srebrenica is a wound that has left a deep scar on the history of europe .
seventeen years after the massacre , hundreds of bodies have yet to be identified .
it continued in europe with srebrenica and it continues today in gaza !
the memory of what we could have witnessed should be an integral part of our heritage .

iran the shirin ebadi case
and who can blame them ?
she defended the rights of iranian women and children , fighting to change divorce and inheritance laws in iran .
those who work there have been threatened , imprisoned and intimidated .
after all , as fellow human beings , her struggle is also our struggle .
this question should also be addressed to the council and the commission .
the iranian regime is potentially the biggest threat to world peace and the rule of law .
mr president , mr matsakis is right .
under the regime's critics , she enjoyed a privileged position for years .
unlike most other victims of persecution in iran , shirin ebadi is not anonymous but internationally known and respected .
it runs counter to the best , most noble traditions of one of the most ancient countries on earth .
i would also like to draw your attention to further arrests of university students in shiraz .
we must defend the independence of the student movement in iran .
we support the resolution .
i think that more radical action needs to be taken in this field .
ro iran provides perhaps the least documented cases of human rights violations within the international community .
it is encouraging that several resolutions have been proposed on this subject , initiated by several political groups .
this constructive criticism can only help relations between the european union and iran .
placing the people's mujahedin of iran on the list of terrorist organisations was a scandal from the outset .
the iranians themselves must perform this task .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , we have to condemn it !
we call on you to vote in favour of the joint resolution of the six political groups .
this dictator came to power following a coup d'état in 1984 and has been in power ever since .
the reaction from the outside world is one of confusion .
in fact , guinea has never enjoyed true democracy in its half century of independence .
in this case , the elections are to be held in two yearstime .
however , in practice , the officers start to exercise power and find that they like it .
this then leads to social oppression and revolts , as well as violations of human rights and democratic principles .
all this undoubtedly is of concern to the international community .
press freedom in kenya
mr president , kenya has a violent past .
the victors mainly belong to one major tribe , the kikuyu .
kenya has now lost that success story image .
president kibaki needs to realise that political stability and a free press are mutually reinforcing .
i hope that president kibaki will take our advice and change his mind .
these conventions include the right to freedom of speech .
i hope that those responsible for these incidents will be justly punished .
this is an utterly inconceivable situation .
lt why are we concerned with freedom of the press in kenya ?
this freedom is among the key european values and it cannot be called into question .
the debate is closed .
such fundamental pillars of democracy as freedom of speech and freedom of the press are not respected .
the free press is in serious danger .
state control and censorship were sections of a draft amendment to a communications bill .
that is far from a democratic society .
this must be done as soon as possible .

the report will therefore be put to the vote on thursday .
the next item is one minute speeches on matters of political importance .
why is this important ?
thank you very much , mr president .
i am a supporter of care for the environment and of action to protect nature .
in making the decision , were their lives considered at all ?
its journalists were imprisoned , and those who came to their aid were manhandled in the street .
handicapped citizens cannot use these cards in all eu member states .
as an example , this makes it difficult for them to park their cars in designated parking spaces .
bg this week a referendum will be held in switzerland on the free movement of people .
i am concerned .
i asked to speak because of a tragic accident that occurred three days ago in croatia .
such views and talk can only support russia's policies and its special forces .
ladies and gentlemen , here is a one minute rapid snapshot of the still rampant european racism .
the police forces are sweeping through roma families with helicopters , dogs and armed police officers .
thank you very much .
every day , companies announce cutbacks in production , layoffs of workers or even complete closure .
the competent european commissioner confirmed that the cannons had not been purchased out of the schengen fund .
it would appear , however , that some people need to hear this message again .
only a share of eur 20 million earmarked from billions for projects !
all this after a big gas crisis !
as you know , bulgaria was most seriously affected and is the only country completely reliant on russian gas .
we were supported by 254 members of parliament from 25 different member states , which was huge support .
we acknowledge the fundamental rights and freedoms of european citizens .
it is imperative that there be a positive outcome to it soon .
european citizens expect the european union to protect them and to offer them practical assistance .
in this resolution , it called for the fate of the missing persons in cyprus to be ascertained .
ro given the current climate in europe , guaranteeing energy security is becoming a priority .
this project is of paramount importance .
in addition , it is high time the european union had these things checked by inspectors .
this military solution is fraught with problems .
around 30 to 40 million m3 of trees have been brought down .
this is a hugely important round .
in april or may there will be elections in india .
we have one new administration in the united states .
maybe a visit to the committee on international trade would prove appropriate .
i do not feel that this is an adequate distinction , clearly , but it is interesting .
were the doha round to be concluded , it would be a disaster for all nations .
you can be assured of my whole hearted support in your efforts to reach a rapid agreement .
if we are open , then they need to be open too .
what can we expect from china ?
that is why it is important to proceed with the multilateral doha negotiations .
these are important issues that we are talking about here .
country after country introduced duties , quantitative restrictions ,buy domesticrules and competing devaluations .
there is actually a high risk of this state of affairs being repeated this time round .
the eu is the largest trading bloc in the world and therefore has considerable responsibility .
thank you for the opportunity to speak .
the failure of the doha round will probably never be more costly than it is right now .
we have seen this throughout history .
i think we should remember that .
we are concerned about it , as we should be .
there is a danger that protectionism will increase because of the current world economic crisis .
i also think that it is precisely providing services that teaches management , cooperation and good standards .
in connection with this , the accent on opening the market to services is very important for both sides .
i could not agree more with that .
it is about production and employment in the textile and clothing sector in various european member states .
what measures does the commission intend to adopt to protect production and employment in the textile and clothing sector ?
what is the current situation regarding the proposed regulation onmade inlabels ?
by promoting a process of gradual change , we have helped the sector adapt .
the right political responses are not to close our markets or monitoring of the imports .
the challenges for the sector predate the current slowdown .
eight of the fifteen applications under the globalisation adjustment fund have been to support textile workers .
however , let us not undermine this industry's capacity for recovery by being lax and negligent .
almost 20 000 workers may become unemployed .
moreover , china and other countries are constantly increasing market access barriers affecting eu products .
as we all know , the double checking system is no longer in operation .
as stated by mrs wortmann kool earlier , 350 000 jobs have been lost over the past two years .
the french government has already developed a system of additional credit insurance for the clothing and textile sector .
it is simply a matter of political will and coordination .
i believe that it is probably wrong just to apply protective measures .
it is specifically designed to help small businesses address issues of defence .
the commission statement on the consequences of the recent gas crisis 
i believe that we should not remain idle on this transit issue .
what are the lessons to be learnt ?
it has revealed , for the third time , the need for a common energy policy .
in particular , the objective of 20 % energy efficiency will have to be made binding .
the task is to predict the future of the european union's energy supply .
to do this , ambitious objectives must be set with regard to the fight against climate change .
now , at what level ?
their carbon footprint is of absolute importance and I know that the industry is working on this .
the second level is ict as an enabler across the board and in all sectors of economic activity .
one of the pilot projects being put into action now is the intelligent transport system .
the implementation of the nabucco project is exceptionally important in this regard .
i think that this laperrouze report is of sufficient quality as to eliminate the need for any substantial amendments .
security of supply and solidarity among the member states must be at the heart of the european energy policy .
my own personal opinion is that we do not need nuclear energy .
upfront , there are costs .
mrs laperrouze next recommended diversifying the sources and routes of supply .
not one of these issues has been resolved , and yet the commission is now launching this pro nuclear offensive .
mr president , commissioners , solidarity is a lovely word .
it generally belongs to the vocabulary of the left .
in practice it will not be done with reference to the lowest prices , but some average prices .
in that case there will be losers those countries with cheap electricity .
the recent gas conflict between russia and ukraine by no means left the european union unscathed .
this is pre eminently a matter for the member states to decide , rather than the eu .
more clarity on this in the report would have been welcome .
under article 36 of our accession treaty we have the right to start reactivating this nuclear power station .
even small contributions from biofuels result in less dependence on fossil fuels and a change in prices .
i must also emphasise the issue of nuclear power .
i would like to conclude on that note .
i call on the commission and member states to promote and finance research projects aimed at improving energy efficiency .
this is totally unacceptable .
this is totally unacceptable .
thank you .
there have so far been neither safeguards nor guarantees and these have yet to appear .
we have a very clear long term energy strategy for the whole of the european union .
we have had very heated debates about it .
as long as we do not set priorities , we shall never allocate money wisely .
we must begin with the efficiency of buildings , vehicles , fridges and so on .
where is there room in all of this for blind loyalty to nuclear power ?
i have to say , commissioner , that you cannot even get your sums right .
just look at the facts !
not a penny for town twinning !
not a penny for solar energy , and not a penny for biomass !
the recent gas crisis has shown that this is an extremely important task .
this decision undoubtedly weakened the energy self sufficiency not only of slovakia , but also of the european union .
you are nodding , commissioner I see that we are in full agreement here .
we will need to apply a lot more energy and brainpower to solving the problem of waste and disposal .
in fact the opposite is true .
the eu has the chance to show its effectiveness and to gain new strength .
it may also show its passivity and risk marginalisation .
we must have smart grids and smart houses .
this would not be the case with smart grids .
in this way we could also cooperate with neighbouring countries in the mediterranean .
the reason for such a step on our part is very simple .
what does it mean ?
let us finish the legislative procedure during the next three months .
it is very important for us .
fi mr president , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , we have history behind us .
this is thus a very serious issue .
people and companies do not know about the energy they are consuming without smart technology .
we find it odd that ukraine is a transit country .
they are crucial to the task of transforming buildings from being energy consumers into being net energy producers .
this is an important issue for the future .
the baltic sea is one of our most sensitive inland seas .
the european parliament has also expressed its doubts about this on a previous occasion .
firstly , the european union does not have an energy strategy .
it is , unfortunately , damned hard , which is why the answer is so varied .
that would be irresponsible .
by intelligent , I mean varied , and being open to new things and not standing still .
the answer is technology .
no , it is the private sector that will have to do that .
we are not speaking with one voice .
the president cut off the speaker 
ideas have already emerged regarding potential alternatives .
thank you very much .
there is a need for a more intensive dialogue with producer countries , transit countries and other consumer countries .
cooperation should be increased with the countries of the middle east , the mediterranean region and north africa .
however , solidarity among the member states is essential for the survival of the eu itself .
the eu must immediately adopt effective legislation to help overcome energy supply crises or avoid them altogether .
how is this consistent with eu member state solidarity , the common energy policy and energy security ?
the smart grid will allow solar , wind and hydro generated electricity to level the security graph .
i called upon the european commission then to take firm action .
the second issue is the capacity for energy storage .
ireland's dependency is extremely high 91 % of our needs are imported .
the european union will give added value to the initiatives developed by the member states .
we hope for your understanding .
meeting the need predominantly from non renewable sources of energy is beginning to outweigh environmental acceptability .
in connection with this europe does not have a more or less unified price .
are we also considering , within the southern corridor , the white stream caspian georgia black sea ukraine romania project ?
but I believe that the debate definitely shows that the rapporteur has struck the right balance .
on the third internal market package , I would just say what it does for europe .
that will solve a lot of issues .
second , a european body for transmission system operators .
what is the council discussing ?
that should give enough legal and regulatory clarity for investing in the nabucco pipeline .
i have heard some criticism that the euro recovery plan is not about efficiency .
then energy efficiency will not only be about speeches but also about facts .
what are the energy sources ?
i believe that we have set some very ambitious targets for 20it is quite clear that a large share has been allocated to all renewable energy sources .
energy matters are the greatest challenge of our times .
both countries must take responsibility for the fact that member states did not receive gas .
europe , for its part , must diversify energy sources and improve supply security .
this requires interconnections .
it is also necessary to improve energy efficiency , especially in the new member states .
the eu needs to break out of its own vicious circle at last .
this is about much , much more than energy !
a pole is wise after the event ! 
development impact of economic partnership agreements epas short presentation 
economic partnership agreementsreally is quite a mouthful , particularly in german .
we are trying to link together trade and development , by which I mean trade policy and development policy .
apart from the two deletions , my draft report is identical to the first draft .
the commission does not see our commitment to the epa process ending on signature .
unfortunately we are still a long way away from them .
the territory of europe is too small to have zones that are off limits to its citizens .
most of these live in the soil or in rotting timber and are highly sensitive to changes .
but , despite the fundamental importance of preserving biodiversity , progress to date has been limited .
it is also important to add one clarification to the report .
a conference will take place in prague in may 200for this reason , the commission considers the european parliament resolution timely .
thank you very much to the rapporteur .
i wish to outline two things here 
in writing . wilderness can mean different things to different people .
europe's biodiversity is the most precious legacy which we can leave future generations .
these parks are part of the protected area network pan .
the solutions range from optimising the use of existing capacity to perhaps revising the regulations on slots .
the fourth and last point refers to the environmental sustainability of this area of activity .
over two thirds of all aircraft certified in the eu are in this sector .
general and business aviation mainly comprises small and medium sized enterprises .
the regulations need to be adapted to this specific nature , without , however , compromising safety or security .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
however , to make the most of it , we need to establish the proper regulation .
this is true of commercial air transport and business and general aviation .
the continuing growth in business aviation , however , is clogging up the airports in use more and more .
the aim must be nothing less than emission free air traffic .
the men and women who are today involved in establishing inter generational solidarity networks deserve recognition .
their determination is an important contribution to national and european wealth and to the common good .
it is therefore necessary to assess this value in an explicit and positive manner .
the european union must create a political framework in order to achieve this target .
economists use mathematical models to highlight the value of housework .
ignoring this fact means maintaining the ideas of the past .
we would like to congratulate parliament on the very important work done .
discrimination based on gender is still a reality , unfortunately , even in the european union member states .
one of the european union's key values is to eliminate any form of discrimination .
one of the fields in which women are hugely underrepresented is scientific research .
thank you !
however , it is not the case if one of the parents carries out this work .
successfully balancing professional and personal life is starting to become a strenuous task for women .
in this area the eu could indirectly contribute and help member states to modernise their policies .
i congratulate mr harbour on his work .
we can only make a difference if we work together .
driving innovation and developing the knowledge economy are key in ensuring sustainable high quality public services .
agenda of the next sitting see minutes
the sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m. 
i am also grateful to all the ngos and institutions that have followed our work closely .
we therefore need to roll it out across all 27 member states .
the development of the internet is contributing to the proliferation of new threats for our children .
that said , parliament is still not satisfied , and mrs angelilli's report is evidence of this .
i must say that I am not satisfied either .
we must also resolve the question of extraterritoriality by taking a joint european approach .
eighty per cent were female , and child abuse domains totalled more than 3 000 .
on the other side , the international cooperation of law enforcement authorities is limited .
in this field there is a lot to do .
thank you .
there are three points in this report which I believe are in need of improvement .
we can only combat this abuse successfully by attacking it at the roots .
however , I do not approve of making internet service providers into an extension of the law enforcement agencies .
this must be a legally binding obligation .
supporting the victims of this reprehensible business , and of their families , is also an important matter .
this is actually about the rights and the protection of children and young people .
however , the protection also has to involve the children themselves .
the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography are abhorrent crimes , the prevention of which requires international cooperation .
the explosive increase in criminal activities via the internet requires a coordinated approach .
moreover , I would like to argue in favour of strengthening cooperation with europol and eurojust .
we must make sure that child safety becomes a central issue in all eu member states .
mrs angelilli's excellent report contributes to this effort , and we support it with our vote as well .
we must be able to protect our children before they become victims .
thank you .
ro sexual exploitation of children and child pornography are very serious crimes .
there have even been attempts to form paedophile political parties .
this must fill every decent citizen of the european union with horror .
that is why I am strongly in favour of the report .
to some extent , the adage of our german friends , einmal ist keinmal , applies here .
the free movement of people in the european union gives them greater scope for doing so .
mr president , I would also like to congratulate mrs angelilli for her very fine report .
i therefore thank mrs angelilli for her report .
rapid crime detection and strict enforcement of penalties are imperative .
cooperation is needed from the media .
indeed , there are even specious notions about so calledgood paedophilia . 
provision also needs to be made for improving the living conditions of victims .
a stranger arouses interest .
it is such a simple message .
we had a recent case in ireland which highlighted this .
we live in a world where the risks for children and adolescents are continuously growing .
child exploitation , including the sexual exploitation of children , is among society's biggest ills .
the battle against this phenomenon requires much common effort and an integration of measures , methods and resources .
the age limit for sexually motivated crime should also be harmonised .
it will be easier to carry out investigations and bring charges .
i have also had questions on extraterritoriality .
there is also a need for tools .
i would add that , last week , we had a very nice data protection day .
he really has provided much food for thought and , above all , practical commitment .
firstly , there is a lack of data .
written statements rule 142 
low barriers of entry and minimal risk are making it very easy for criminal organisations to get into cyberspace .
in writing . exploiting children in any way is unacceptable .
practical actions are needed because of the increasing evidence of sexual exploitation of children .
children are often unable to understand the seriousness and consequences of a situation .
the commission can , however , support this compromise without hesitation .
personally , I do not see any drawbacks .
they are appropriate in an instrument intended to match the ambitious european policy to combat illegal immigration .
no doubt there are various views on how to resolve this and other problems in this draft .
some of these will be decided when it comes to their implementation .
this , therefore , requires specific education within the bodies that deal with these issues .
what exactly did we achieve by way of this law ?
what we did was to attack one of the main sources that motivate people to turn to illegal immigration .
as of now , this will be absolutely impossible .
claudio fava deserves our congratulations on this in particular .
this pressure is considerable , and rightly so , frankly .
that too , my group will accept .
we still have a long way to go though , so what we must do now is persevere .
this is , quite frankly , unacceptable , in my view .
and yet , economic migration also concerns many eu member states , especially those which acceded more recently .
we have no guarantee that member states will ensure that people are paid .
it is clearly a problem that has been over exaggerated .
what was needed was another measure one that regularised the situation of these millions of people .
instead we have a directive that carries on where the return directive left off .
with this directive , the exploited pay more than the exploiters .
we needed something different .
we needed a measure to curb xenophobia .
british jobs for british workers cannot be guaranteed all the while we are inside the eu .
the prospect of british taxpayers funding foreign workers is , frankly , unacceptable .
well , it is not surprising is it ?
we are not protectionists , but we want good common sense .
we want to control our own borders and decide who lives , works and settles in our country .
it is important for us to make it clear that illegal employment will no longer be tolerated .
however , we must not forget that migrants without residence permits will ultimately have to be deported .
sv I would like to begin by thanking claudio and everyone else who made this report possible .
of course , this should be done not only through those seeking work but also through those offering it .
that , therefore , is our reason for wholly welcoming this directive .
they protect workers so that they can report the situation in which they find themselves .
cases of slave labour occur , under conditions of exploitation and child labour .
this is why the right of trade unions to represent the interests of these workers is so important .
coordinated action by all the countries of the eu is needed to tackle every aspect of illegal employment .
the financial penalties are enough of an incentive to be careful in the selection of employees .
last year alone , there were no fewer than 12 000 in as small a country as belgium .
i therefore agree with combating illegal work across the european union .
of course , this must form part of an overall policy on migration and immigration .
this is cowardly and unhelpful .
we have already seen this in the case of many reports and actions .
there is , of course , one thing that we can be sure of .
the most important issue is to protect the people in these employment relationships from exploitation .
however , the authorities must put in place more controls and prosecute those suspected of committing offences .
the report is a compromise between the council and the european parliament and specifies minimum standards .
nevertheless , the prospect of member states strengthening or weakening the requirements is not inspiring .
we have taken the first step forward .
el madam president , the rapporteur claudio fava and the shadow rapporteurs truly deserve our hearty congratulations .
at long last , the employment of illegal immigrants has been criminalised .
multiple , balanced and realistic sanctions are provided for in the directive .
however , special care must be taken for all those illegal immigrants who are already in the european union .
it was no easy task and the path was strewn with pitfalls .
sv we know that more and more people are hiding within the eu's borders .
we know that many people without documents are exploited and live in miserable conditions .
this will reduce the chances of finding a decent life in europe .
i would like to say to mrs segelström that we do not have a conservative government in sweden .
it must be made clear that working legally is the only way to work in europe .
furthermore , unregistered workers do not benefit from health insurance or pension rights .
this is what we know as modern slavery .
we need to be firm , to send out a clear message .
the president cut off the speaker 
pl madam president , I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur .
i travelled to italy , to foggia , as soon as the so called work camps were discovered .
in the latter , both union citizens and illegal immigrants were living and operating in appalling circumstances .
nonetheless , the law is not working .
do not complain that the union .
the president cut off the speaker 
it is my belief that this directive represents a step in the right direction .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding work .
we must also ensure that this kind of behaviour is appropriately punished .
however , I would like to draw your attention to the complexity of the current situation .
these sectors use illegal labour to an alarming degree .
should he or she report the matter to the police , or terminate the contract ?
the employer would not be in a position to provide the relevant evidence .
alternatively , it may be that it will be used to sanction employers unfairly and unjustifiably .
i have received representations from constituents , so I welcome action on this matter .
in fact , rather than interfering , it actually puts things in order .
they can easily procure a cheap labour force .
i have in mind , for example , work in poland for citizens of ukraine .
i would also like to thank mr fava and parliament once again for having enabled this compromise .
we must , of course , fight against illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings .
thank you as well for the quality of this debate .
i am thinking of the temporary residence permit for minors who have been exploited .
jobs in france must be reserved for the french , while jobs in europe are reserved for europeans .
at the same time , we need to be aware of the future risks which we are exposed to .
i would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the fine job he has done .
close cooperation is undoubtedly needed in order to combat illegal immigration .
this does not , however , mean that the directive is only about penalising employers .
i trust , too , that these provisions will be effectively implemented by the member states .
extension of the ec usa agreement for scientific and technological cooperation 
in my view , it is not a good system , but that is the current tool .
general and business aviation 
thank you , mr president and mr zaleski .
combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography 
we shall now proceed to the vote .
we are all aware that russia remains one of our most important and also most difficult trading partners .
one way of tackling this would be to free ourselves from dependency on russian raw materials .
they were rejected .
there are small airports , there are medium sized airports and there are large international hubs .
we do not want the european union to be a massive airport structure .
the prejudices of the last century are deepening the demographic crisis .
mr president , thank you for your patience and indulgence .
let me take the opportunity to explain why I voted against the greens and their amendment .
work of a nursing , caring , educating and teaching nature should be properly valued .
principles supporting effective protection of intellectual property and equitable sharing of intellectual property rights are actively promoted .
after setting up the european institute of technology , this transatlantic scientific and technological cooperation will generate new opportunities .
i would like to see included also other cutting edge fields , such as stem cell research .
this applies especially to biotechnology .
finally , I applaud the addition of space research and the security sector to the ec / us agreement .
principles supporting effective protection of intellectual property and equitable sharing of intellectual property rights are actively promoted .
the last few days have borne witness to russia's serious unreliability as a trading partner .
it is indeed essential to renew the agreement drawn up with the soviet government years ago .
these are distinct .
to take an example , europe is too small to have forbidden areas for its citizens .
most areas in europe which are wilderness are protected under natura 2000 .
there are also many species that have not yet been discovered and described .
most of these live in the soil or in rotting wood and are highly sensitive to change .
the same precepts demand that interventions and regulations be balanced and considered .
moreover , the ethical reasons for this decision must not be forgotten .
the term wilderness refers to a natural environment that has not been significantly altered by human activity .
there is a difference between the notions of conservation and protection .
the former involves proper use of nature .
this can be exploited in an environmentally friendly manner by developing new products in the area of tourism .
i am impressed with the commission's commitment to proportionality in the regulation of general and business aviation .
this can be altered through what is known as pre commercial procurement .
europe spends usd 2.5 billion .
pre commercial procurement will address this anomaly .
this is most unfortunate if we really want to strengthen our innovative potential .
one example of a solution developed on the basis of public procurement is the gps navigation system .
for smes , public procurement represents a valuable opportunity to gain experience .
we must capitalise on the benefit which we will gain from a pre commercial procurement policy .
we need to follow the example of the us and focus more on procuring research and development services .
we must define a beneficial pre commercial policy instrument in order to boost the eu's innovative base .
there are pros and cons .
the nuclear debate is never ending .
one cannot fail to take note of the possibility of evaluating this energy supply .
i am informed that malta was considering the importation of energy generated from nuclear plants in france .
we do not have a single european energy policy .
each state defends its own interests .
due to the issue of global warming , coal cannot be considered atransitional component.
the diversification of energy supplies assumes that there are gas and oil pipelines to transport resources to the eu .
the tbc and nabucco projects are affecting the political stability of our neighbours .
as it stands currently , I am voting against this report .
the diversification of energy sources and suppliers cannot remain a matter for the member countries themselves .
only a united europe is strong and competitive in an age of rapid globalisation .
i greatly valued mrs laperrouze's work and have therefore voted in favour of its adoption .
in this context there are , however , repeated indicators suggesting that it is more permanent than transitory .
it is an enormous challenge , but it is a strategic issue which we cannot ignore .
the need for clear definitions across the european union on energy poverty is also important .
the concept ofworkhas to be given a wider interpretation .
at the very least , all full time motherswork must be credited for contributory pension purposes .
i voted in support of this report despite some misgivings and concern with the overall thrust of the report .
we must do everything that we possibly can to achieve gender equality .
there are also wordings that open the way for a common tax policy .
the household economy deserves a more important role than the one currently allocated to it .
the value of this integration work amounts to almost one third of the national income in germany .
we need more jobs which are suitable for older people .
we must put it into practice .
i hope that in six monthstime , we will be able to provide it with an explanation .
the report was unanimously approved in the committee on women's rights .
the entire left wing spectrum in the european parliament voted for the alternative resolution .
it was definitely a step in the wrong direction .
i voted in favour .
in particular , it is important that information about offenders is coordinated and updated regularly .
we conservatives therefore voted in favour of the report .
these common sense proposals aim to protect the most vulnerable members of our societies .
i am voting in favour of the angelilli report on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography .
this is wholly in accord with my view of the eu as a union of values .
i have therefore voted against the report as a whole .
we have little data about how extensive it is .
the large majority of victims of human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation are children and adolescents .
child pornography is a delicate subject which should always be a main focus for european and national authorities .
european union member states should severely punish any kind of child sex abuse and any kind of online grooming .
in addition , indecency offences involving children should fall within extra territorial criminal legislation .
a computer game cannot replace talking to one's grandmother .
the natural family is the space for protection of children , and parents are their first protectors .
member states must ensure that the legislation will be amended so that websites with criminal content are blocked .

the presidency expressed this sentiment through a statement which was issued shortly after president obama signed the executive orders .
these welcome developments will enable us to strengthen even more transatlantic cooperation in the area of countering terrorism .
the decision to close guantánamo is , of course , primarily the responsibility of the united states .
in his executive order to close guantánamo , president obama ordered a review of the status of all detainees .
we have raised these issues in the framework of the political dialogue with the united states .
the european parliament has played an important role in raising awareness of this issue .
at present , the us has not made a formal request .
as mrs ferrero waldner repeatedly says , positive cooperation is required .
we have to work together with the member states to put this in place .
mr president , that is what I have to say on my own and mrs ferrero waldner's behalf .
it concerns the cia using european countries for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners .
only the investigative instruments and resources of the member states will be sufficient for the task .
parliament has also requested an assessment of national anti terrorist legislation .
i am sure that it is equally warmly welcomed by this parliament .
the european union is committed to the absolute prohibition of torture and of cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment .
the position of this parliament was clearly expressed in your resolution of february 200let us look forwards rather than backwards .
some people allege that the prisoners have been tortured .
this is a reason for accepting them , under the dictates of humanity .
it is without doubt true that torture is the most inhumane and degrading practice .
we must also do that in this case .
we lack the open debate and the collective change of will which american democracy allows .
yet , too often , member states from our union were complicit in what the bush administration did .
the united states must prosecute suspects , where sound evidence exists and in accordance with the rule of law .
if asked , should not europe offer those few citizens the rights and freedoms that no other country will ?
europe has to speak with one voice and play its part in ending this affront to justice .
three things are absolutely certain regarding this matter .
we are certainly bound to remove our citizens and residents from the camp .
mr president , my group welcomes the remarks made by minister vondra about guantánamo bay .
would you ask the us now who the inmates are ?
although I was pleased with the remarks about guantánamo bay , I am a little dismayed at the cia .
we are hesitating and starting a shameful period of horse trading .
what has happened to our call for the universality and indivisibility of human rights ?
we cannot really be saying that we want to preach one thing and do another .
thank goodness for that .
they should be tried and acquitted or convicted , released or punished .
why ?
can we be asked to take that risk in the eu ?
member states have shown different degrees of willingness to take former inmates .
therefore I require , and we require , that such decisions are consulted with other eu members .
we ask and what about the citizensright to know ?
assuming the alde group accepts my advice , we will neither table nor support any amendments to this resolution .
i just want to deal with a couple of things .
i must remind the house once more that terrorism is a global threat that also affects union citizens .
the american people have done so through the polls .
if there is proof against any of them , they should be tried .
thank you very much .
i believe this is the case for most people here .
now that the decision has been made , let there be no mistake about our position .
they have been locked up illegally by the bush administration , which clearly violated international law .
it is , therefore , first and foremost an american problem that needs to be solved by washington .
this is based purely on assumptions .
es mr president , guantánamo is a problem that was not created by the european union .
yet it is clear that we did not create it ourselves .
the prisoners of guantánamo cannot be dealt with as if they were an undifferentiated herd .
they are people with rights , but also with their own personal stories .
i entirely agree with messrs schulz and watson .
the first point of the resolution mentions the important changes in united statespolicy concerning humanitarian laws .
el mr president , the inhumane prison at guantánamo should never have been opened .
if we do not do this , we risk being irrelevant in the process of closing guantánamo .
it is not acceptable to say now that this problem is not our business .
however , mistakes have been committed and controversial decisions have been made in the name of this desired objective .
the romanian parliament has carried out an investigation and supplied the results to the interested parties .
we look away we turn our back .
for this reason , we must make it clear that the question of credibility is of great political importance .
european responsibility for violations of the rule of law and human rights cannot be erased .
guantánamo should never have been created and it needed to be closed .
the position of the european parliament on terrorism is equally clear .
it is a fact that the united states has shouldered most of the burden in the fight against terrorism .
the united states undertook to defend the free world on behalf of us all .
europe needs to feel responsible for the war on global terrorism .
no means deemed inadmissible under signed international conventions may be used .
that should put an end to the debate on secret prisons and transit flights .
he was seized in the border areas between afghanistan and pakistan .
he is a geologist who was working there .
we can decide ourselves to sign a bilateral agreement with the us , as portugal has done .
cohesive leadership is now needed from the irish government in this regard .
mr president , the eu has been asking for the closure of guantánamo for a long time .
mr president , the prison at guantánamo bay was a necessary creation of the united states at the time .
its closure is now a matter for the united states .
the martin report is the best example of this approach .
europe must learn to speak with one voice and to take united action .
one the one hand , there is the legal position .
i believe that citizens of a country should be readmitted into their country of origin .
the union is now a unit , and this problem must therefore be considered .
it has a moral and political dimension , but also a security and legal dimension .
it is certainly more complex than that .
graham watson spoke of the need to approach this with one voice .
but if we do receive a request , we need to be prepared to react .
this is one level .
i think we should be aware that the discussion has only just begun .
it has only been one week .
a clear position of the respective member states on the resettlement of detainees is not yet known .
that is absolutely essential .
we could then possibly add financial assistance to facilitate reception in some member states .
the debate is closed .
the speculation mentioning romania in connection with the cia's secret prisons is totally unfounded .
no one has been able to prove their existence in romania .
you have specifically raised the situation on the islands of mayotte and lampedusa .
we should take care to distinguish between the two types of migratory flows in these two cases .
until now , the legislation and practice regarding detention in the member states has varied considerably .
it also , through the most recent legislation , sets commonly agreed standards on return policy .
our asylum and migration policy is thus rooted in the rule of law .
it ensures respect for human rights and for the dignity of the individual .
i am relying on the efforts of mrs ferrero waldner to achieve a quick result in the current negotiations .
those are the remarks I wished to make to you .
this is a percentage which is unknown in our european countries , thank god .
the french authorities are well aware of these difficulties .
we often have 180 days of detention , including for those who are fleeing from political persecution or war .
1 200 people died in 2008 when trying to cross the mediterranean .
and this is quite apart from enforcement .
it is something that is included in your press releases .
in the next few days , my group , too , will organise a delegation that will visit lampedusa .
the period within which the member states have to transpose these directives into legislation is two years .
the issue of immigration is urgent , though , and a two year period is too long .
it is shocking that the reception situation at lampedusa should need to be discussed in this manner again .
i would therefore call on the council presidency to make this a priority .
the detention centre was not built to cope with this capacity .
we have known this for three years .
it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , nothing in this house surprises me any more .
i am sorry that he is not here in the house .
what is the consequence of this ?
76 requests were examined in 3 days .
now what counts are the true facts lampedusa and malta and others are carrying a terrible burden .
the citizens are not annoyed with the italian government .
they are annoyed because they themselves can no longer endure this situation .
what therefore should be done ignore the rules ?
those who come normally present themselves as asylum seekers .
we must treat these people as free citizens and with respect .
what we are talking about now seems very strange to me .
why should those who arrive on the island of lampedusa be forced to remain there forever ?
when we visited , the camp had been cleared and the detainees replaced by puppets .
all asylum seekers and all minors have already been transferred to appropriate centres .
what has been said is false .
maroni exposed this .
we should start by allowing the people who are stranded here to have a proper education .
let me start with the negatives the limitations .
a lot has been said during this particular debate about the countries most involved italy and france .
there are strategic issues .
that is absolutely essential
that is not the aim of this fund .
question time commission 
this means that the proposal has successfully completed first reading and will shortly be adopted by the council .
this will enhance the openness of defence markets between member states to the benefit of all .
only negotiations with the full commitment of the parties can bring about a lasting solution .
but , commissioner , all our trade agreements have a human rights clause in them .
a lot of people have asked for further supplementary questions on this question .
i will , therefore , take supplementary questions from mr allister and mr rack .
vice president of the commission . I can assure you that the commission always tries to be balanced .
the commission will then seek the programme management committee's favourable opinion .
does the commissioner have any information on this and what exactly is contemplated ?
will the situation become more or less dangerous ?
can you imagine allocating programme funding in the same way as with the eurostars programme ?
another threat already identified is cyber attacks and different attempts to attack and block via the internet .
however , I cannot give a concrete answer today on the issue of young people's participation .
which decisions by the commissioner has mr boomer influenced ?
what is the timetable for decision making ?
this call was made with full transparency , via publication in the official journal .
vice president of the commission . as I said , he must know a lot of people .
nine sites have been suggested , but I do not know where these sites are .
so far , nothing is clear , so I am very interested to see all these proposals .
we understand that a search is going on for property outside the european area .
that is the main idea .
i suggest , though , that we keep out of belgian internal debates and interests .
the roles are divided .
it is important to mention that europol is playing a substantial role in fighting counterfeiting .
do we take the same attitude in the european union ?
so this has been promised at least .
subject efficient spending of the eu budget
this is a huge machine which must work smoothly .
does the commissioner think that this is acceptable ?
this would provide a model of efficiency for using european public money .
i think it would be very useful for the sustainable economic development of the european union .
vice president of the commission . that is a huge question .
i can only pass this question to my colleagues .
there are some opportunities to support energy efficiency through the cohesion funds .
this was a really big achievement .
in particular , the reasons for the listing had not been communicated in advance of the decision .
the organisation was therefore not in a position to make its views known before a decision was taken .
i should like to thank the commissioner .
let me make it clear that I condemn terrorism in all its forms .
i assume the council and other european institutions will follow the court's decisions .
how would the union be able to deal with such a request quickly , if this could be done ?
the negotiations will be the same as with all other candidate countries .
i think this will be the key element in future negotiations .
these are described in the attached surveys of individual countries .
however , the commission may act as a catalyst for change , to support efforts of member states .
you also mentioned in reply to me that the european social fund could be used for training .
i would like you perhaps to elaborate more on that .
we wish to take action on this issue too , through the european social fund .
the renewed social agenda also proposes strengthening the open method of coordination .
very often , in economically difficult times , young people unfortunately get into drug abuse .
the sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. 
we cannot sweep these problems under the carpet !
the citizens of europe expect us to provide genuine answers .
however , the union does not have general powers in the area of the protection of minority rights .
the integration of immigrants is an important and growing issue for the member states of the european union .
we have inherited the results of all this .
nearly a tenth of eu citizens currently belong to a national , linguistic or ethnic minority .
russia's involvement and propaganda in estonia and latvia , for example , is a cautionary example .
i believe that the roma need more support from the state .
in particular , they need assistance with vocational training and with education in general .
however , in many countries , this respect is weak or non existent .
this leads to discrimination in which minorities are abused and relegated to the poorest of circumstances .
this negates the purpose of the agreement .
hungary is indeed where ethnic minorities have been almost completely eliminated over the past decades .
the words of the former ombudsman for minorities in hungary , jenö kaltenbacha , confirm this .
in those schools , slovak is taught for four hours a week .
this is why eu regulation is necessary and why the assistance of the eu is necessary .
with the recent enlargement towards the east , the situation has , unavoidably , become far more complex .
each social group is different .
many of them feel that they are stepchildren within their own homeland .
they look to the european union to guarantee their rights and help improve their situation .
this would give a clear signal that the minorities are also full citizens of a unifying europe .
europe cannot have stepchildren , since in one sense or another , all of us are minorities .
in the countries of the former communist camp , the principle of non intervention was supreme .
the right to asylum is a way for people to vote with their feet .
your ultimate allegiance must always be to the country in which you settle .
over time , this will only create either a field of indifference or a field for a battle .
we often witnesses the strengthening of assimilationist efforts allegedly in the minority's own interest .
the establishment of internal legal standards to protect the legal status of minorities is unavoidable .
indeed , the presence in this chamber of romanian meps who are ethnic hungarians is living proof of this .
the european project is about integration and not about creating enclaves based on ethnic criteria .
the speaker continued in basque 
yet , for the sustainability of our multi ethnic society , is there any alternative to higher education ?
their loyalty has been unbroken .
i therefore fully support the elaboration of a comprehensive regulation for the protection of minority rights at european level .
we hope for protection of rights for groups that is our goal .
i would be happier if the representatives of these minorities said that they were well treated .
we must work towards unity in cultural diversity .
at european union level , however , it is very important that double standards not be applied .
we owe equal rights to all european citizens , irrespective of their ethnic background .
this is an obvious and welcome approach .
i would like to give you an example where the reality contradicts the assertions being made .
thank you .
cultural and linguistic diversity must be preserved , as it is the basis for a healthily functioning union .
it is true that , despite the problems , the situation of the hungarian community in romania is better .
that is the reality and I would like to thank you for the debate .
i cannot go any further , because we do not have the legal tools .
the member states will not allow us to .
in the wake of this summit , mr špidla is going to establish a european platform on the roma .
the debate is closed .
it appears that europe is of one mind on this .
nowadays , anyone who queries the rights of minorities will certainly not succeed in the world of politics .
article 11 of the latter provides for the use of minority languages , including on street signs .
i have been chairman of arad county council and the romania west regional authority .
this has happened , for example , to poles in germany .
germany is thereby violating the fundamental rights of minorities .
the case of people who have arrived in our countries from outside europe is quite different .
how is that possible ?
no wonder the naturalisation rate is slow .
is this situation good or bad for the european union ?
this is a question for the commission and council .
participation begins at local community level .
the eu must take action on their behalf .
these people are called non citizens .
i do not believe it should be tolerated .
those languages were simply banned .
what does that mean ?
english is my mother tongue , but I am not english I am irish .
one of the largest migrant communities in ireland is british .
they can all vote in local elections in ireland .
latvia aims to have citizens with full rights , instead of having non citizens with many rights .
the majority of latvia's businesses belong to russian entrepreneurs .
the commissioner spoke only of the integration of non citizens into society and their naturalisation .
stalin then imported not only russian speakers , but ukrainian speakers and belarussian speakers .
if he could learn the language , I am sure that those russian speaking latvians can do the same .
thank you .
their arrival is a direct consequence of the occupation of latvia implemented by the soviet union .
why does a large proportion of the russian speaking population not want to apply for citizenship ?
what is russia's part in all this ?
the sitting was closed at 10 55 p.m. 
opening of the sitting
the sitting was opened at 9 a.m. 
action taken on parliament's resolutions see minutes
that has been the greatest advantage of this committee .
instead , we must encourage changes in awareness as well as innovation and motivation .
that is the wonderful thing about it .
i am particularly pleased about that .
nor does it disparage any area .
i just said that we should involve our citizens so that they can do something in their own houses .
its tireless efforts have greatly contributed towards shaping the eu position on climate change .
as you know , the work during the presidency will focus on the international negotiation process .
it is a question of political will and I think that the will exists .
one illustrative element is the measures announced recently for cars .
comparability will be of decisive importance both in achieving the environmental targets and in safeguarding fair terms of competition .
i welcome your contribution to this major effort .
we want retraining programmes for the new green poll workers .
our fifth core theme , finally , is about involving people .
this requires the provision of information and transparency .
i am indebted to all fellow members who have made a contribution to this .
but this planet has finite resources .
there will be long term gain if we step up to the mark .
for example , ireland could become to ocean wave technology what finland is to mobile phone technology .
the length of the report is evidence of the huge number of issues there were to deal with .
i can see that any legislation at european level relating to this issue will be establishing new ground .
the car industry is another growing problem .
between 1990 and 2005 , emissions from the european transport industry increased by 32 % .
we need to ask ourselves whether the situation with all these forms of transport is sustainable .
mr president , 500 years ago there was a consensus amongst learned men that the world was flat .
it , too , is wrong .
nor is it a consensus .
the report that we have before us is , as has already been said , a set of recommendations .
the only way we can be really effective is to improve efficiency .
i personally would argue that it is a success , if only a modest one .
the targets set out in this report and in the eu's climate package are simply not ambitious enough .
but that is not about kick starting economic growth in abusiness as usualdirection .
these reduction targets cannot be met without serious diminution in food production .
with the obama presidency , we have the opportunity to stop exchanging words and start exchanging ideas .
the commissioner has referred to the urgent need to talk to the low income countries in the developing world .
the mindset in the european union has long been that we need action to prevent climate change .
no measures are proposed with regard to the protection of land and soil .
in this regard , we needed to come up with more with regard to growth and jobs .
it is , of course , possible to create jobs in europe .
we must create a basis for development in the field of energy .
i should like to thank karl heinz florenz for his report .
so we have to get this package of measures right .
dorette corbey talked about what can be done in the way of energy efficiency measures .
there is not much time left .
we have now adopted our climate package within the eu here in parliament .
extra quotas for industry , while fostering its competitiveness , nonetheless make it difficult to obtain funding .
this could be done by centrally covering part of the costs of making the changes .
thank you .
europe must act as a pioneer and take charge of realistic , necessary measures on an international basis .
this is completely short sighted .
what was so objectionable to the committee ?
it does not matter to me how the universe was created , or in what time frame .
commissioner , it is an excellent decision .
that is the assumption behind mr florenz's report .
with a budget of eur 76 billion , we are wide of the mark .
the president cut off the speaker 
it may be motivating on a political level to demand that , but it is not realistic .
however , global warming has always started a dozen or so centuries before any increase in carbon dioxide levels .
madam president , a mystique bordering on a religious creed has grown up around this alleged global warming .
we are nearly on the flat line , if not already there .
all these factors will accelerate warming .
this dimension of the problem is referred to in the report but only in passing .
as such , this approach can count on my backing .
i am opposed to the over simplified approach towards the agricultural sector in paragraph 189 , though .
however , commissioner , madam president , we still have the challenge of putting it across to our citizens .
however , I think it is a shame that we have excluded large areas of science .
corresponding applications were rejected by the majority , and that was that .
this will not work , because science does not allow itself to be manipulated .
water plays a central role in climate change .
i am delighted that it will be introduced by an expert group of czech and slovak scientists .
we will prevail only if we give thegreen lightto all progressive solutions in europe .
the proportion of renewable energy is 23 % , a large share of which again belongs to agriculture .
finally , I would like to say the following .
the president cut off the speaker 
climate protection can be accomplished , but the measures need to be swift and consistent .
therefore we need to integrate policies on a horizontal and vertical plane .
policy , legislation and finances must work together .
i wonder about the future of this report from the point of view of its integration into european policies .
no sooner had it been adopted what is more , unanimously this excellent report was buried completely .
perhaps if we had introduced it into european policies , we would not be here now .
i would like to speak to the rapporteur , who denies that he is presenting a political project .
we had a lot of experts in the committee , that is true .
unfortunately , however , they represented only one view .
i think this was a mistake .
it makes no sense constantly to resort to new regulations and new measures .
the solution lies in assuming individual responsibility and not in ever increasing state regulations .
we intend to coordinate the negotiations .
the greatest opportunity for changing the economy is in the global market for carbon .
the second option will be possible only through decentralised renewable electricity .
i am sure that during the first semester of 2009 we will advance the negotiations considerably .
there will be a big stakeholdersmeeting on 30 march 200the harmonised rules on auctioning should be ready by june 20however , a deal in copenhagen is by no means a given much work remains to be done .
required amounts for developing countries are estimated to go up to eur 120 150 billion annually in 20these may partly be supported by international loan arrangements in order to mobilise international private finance .
without this assistance they will not be able to sufficiently reduce their greenhouse gas emissions .
without this assistance the poorest and most vulnerable will suffer the consequences of climate change .
without this assistance there will be no deal in copenhagen .
once again , you have my sincere thanks .
written statements rule 142 
the development of a low emission economy is a genuine challenge we cannot afford not to deal with .
agriculture is one of the areas most vulnerable to climate change because of its dependency on meteorological conditions .
we must set only attainable goals , taking into consideration their effects on the economic crisis .
during the part session in january , we unanimously adopted a resolution on the horn of africa .
i would appeal for support for the release of dawit isaak .
applause 
mr president , this is not the first time that you have visited the european parliament .
you received me at the official headquarters of the palestinian national authority .
today , you have come direct from cairo following a stopover in paris to meet the french president .
the european parliament has not remained silent .
this has to stop .
applause 
a prerequisite for peace between israel and palestine is intra palestinian reconciliation .
we trust you , because you are a man of mediation , reconciliation and therefore also of peace .
applause 
you have witnessed , along with the rest of the world , the burnt and scattered remains of children .
it has also destroyed what the palestinian national authority has established over 15 years .
this is the scene of the aftermath of this war .
the checkpoints have increased from 580 to 6the world declared in anapolis the failure of unilateral and military solutions .
we must not deal with israel as if it were a state above accountability , above international law .
applause 
we warned against falling into this trap that israel wants us to fall into .
applause 
the essence of the conflict in our region is the israeli occupation .
this is the last opportunity we have for true and just peace in our region .
all parties , especially israel , and the quartet , should be loud and honest about this .
he is the poet of humanity .
the time must come for peaceful co existence of the kind which we have in europe .
we wish you , president abbas , every success in all your efforts to bring about peace .
if circumstances permit , we will meet again on 23 and 24 february .
before the vote 
challenge of energy efficiency through information and communications technologies vote 
explanations of vote
the camera was not on me , but on general morillon and then on mr grosch .
so we have to involve the countries of asia .
pl madam president , I would also like to speak on the subject of this directive .
making use of scientific research and using it to develop technological solutions will automatically reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
i support all technical and scientific activities aimed at reducing the use of fossil fuels .
unfortunately , however , I cannot agree with the theories expressed in mr florenz's report .
i do not support the report .
although his original report was better than this compromise I have voted for it none the less .
cs madam president , ladies and gentlemen , I have voted against the florenz report .
research has shown that , as societies become wealthier , the demand for water increases .
many regions of the world are teetering on the brink of disaster .
the material situation of countries , rather than the military capabilities they might possess , will determine their success .
i do not share this view .
i voted against the report because it is a blueprint for substantial political problems .
there is already good work being done in this area .
but I do not know whether my constituents will accept that we are actually going to make any difference .
put the lisbon treaty to a referendum pactio olisipiensis censenda est .
initially , there was liability covering the entire chain right up to the main contractor .
furthermore , there are insufficient guarantees that migrants will be protected and employers punished for breaking the rules .
a return policy should be adopted that is effective and that does exactly what it says on the tin .
madam president , this is a dreadful piece of legislation .
to criminalise national employers at a time of deepening recession is absurd .
cs the european union can now see the first results of the common energy policy .
most important of all is political independence .
however , this starts with the education of our children .
here it is once again in the european parliament .
madam president , I reluctantly supported this , though I would have preferred not to have voted for it .
the reason is that we cannot create efficiency without competition .
that is why I said I voted for this reluctantly .
first of all , guantánamo was set up in order to protect all of our citizens .
since 9 / 11 there has not been one single act of terrorism on the united states mainland .
i will not be holding my breath .
i trust those who voted for this madness will stand over it when it all goes wrong .
they are not exactly squeaky clean .
this is problematic , to say the least .
mine was among the voices raised in concern .
i accepted unlike some in this chamber that these were difficult and sensitive issues .
nonetheless , some principles are absolute and ought not to be sacrificed to expediency .
not to tender it would be mean , inconsistent , hypocritical and self defeating .
they have shown the will .
it is time for us to listen to the voices that count .
madam president , magna carta and habeas corpus are the bedrocks upon which the american constitution was written .
now we have a situation where president obama has , quite correctly , decided to do away with it .
in this area in particular there are many opportunities to save energy .
in writing . climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing the world today .
i am in favour of energy efficient light bulbs , but frankly it is not enough .
my response was clear ratify the lisbon treaty .
however , it suffers from structural weaknesses with regard to the vital and desirable reorientation of the european union .
therefore , it will favour neither a long term vision nor the general interest .
the report calls on econfin to introduce reduced vat rates for renewable energy and energy saving products .
global warming is one of the most complicated issues which the whole planet is facing .
the current economic crisis should not be used as an excuse to row back on our climate commitments .
we simply cannot afford to ignore this issue and wait fifty years to see what the consequences may be .
in spite of the efforts of both the commission and parliament , this matter continues to spark controversy .
different countries have the right to set different objectives .
countries must have the right to choose the technology they use to obtain energy .
changes in our climate are sudden and have serious negative consequences .
in writing . de I have abstained from voting on the climate change report .
unfortunately this type of approach has become more common in the run up to the european elections .
only then will we be able to implement an effective common immigration policy .
next , the possibility of less stringent provisions for private individuals if the private employment conditions are in order .
unfortunately , the limits to this report are also numerous .
the re establishment of internal border controls is not even being considered .
they do poorly paid jobs , often bordering on exploitation .
nevertheless , I accept that guantánamo bay prison should close .
however , nor do I think the eu should tell member states what to do in this regard .
in writing . pt I voted against this joint motion for a resolution .
this is an important step towards a new beginning in us policy .
the celebrations and salutations surrounding president obama are making people delude themselves about the policy of imperialism .
without that , guantánamo will be followed by another poor solution .
i welcomed the news of barack obama's decision concerning the closure of the guantánamo bay prison .
these people have not been charged with any crime .
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
mr lundgren , I am now cutting you off .
we are realistic enough to know that 2009 will present its fair share of difficulties and obstacles .
this has been welcomed by the council .
the commission takes all these issues very seriously .
perhaps I can say a few words on each of them in turn .
the commission has provided technical assistance to the kosovo gender equality agency .
we have stressed with the authorities the urgency of adopting the civil service law .
the plight of roma families in lead contaminated refugee camps in the north is an issue of serious concern .
the commission is actively assisting in finding a swift and sustainable solution acceptable to all .
this work is very important .
the people of kosovo must become aware in their everyday lives that they all live together .
the government of kosovo must also push ahead with its decentralisation programme .
this is the only way in which kosovo will flourish .
madam president , I am speaking on behalf of the socialist group in the european parliament .
we can confirm that the situation in kosovo is improving .
it is essential that eulex cooperates well with the parties concerned in kosovo .
it is gratifying that the mission is supported by the un and that it covers the whole country .
with our resolution , we in the european parliament are supporting kosovo in this mission .
this relates to special aid for establishing the public administration , strengthening civil society and for educational projects .
let alone that eulex's activities would result in that country being split into north and south .
that was absolutely not what was intended .
the majority of the member states , but not all , have recognised kosovo in contravention of international law .
this means that eulex officials can annul simple resolutions made by the kosovan authorities .
on 26 january eulex and kfor held a joint exercise on combating insurrection .
moreover , I got the impression that the different levels did not always work together that well .
via the eulex mission , europe is responsible for the situation on the ground .
this is europe's commitment with regard to the western balkans .
three quarters of the members of this house voted in favour of recognising kosovo .
this is why it is important to look to the future , which involves a number of risks .
the first major risk is the division of kosovo .
however , it is true that there are some questions which remain unanswered .
finally , we should promote the integration of the entire region .
personally , I view this move as an unprecedented violation of international law .
it is quite simple kosovo belongs to serbia .
i followed the troubles in kosovo at close quarters at the end of the 1980s .
i saw slovenia and croatia become independent states and experience war at the beginning of the 1990s .
i , personally , experienced the war in bosnia and finally left the country as a refugee .
the courts should ensure that war crimes are addressed .
applause 
cs I would like to mention briefly the role of serbia in particular .
yesterday , the eu justice mission opened its first war crimes trial in kosovo .
corruption and crime undermine the state .
a second responsibility lies , to my mind , with the neighbouring countries , particularly the serb authorities .
this is not the question , since the quality of the recognitions matters more than the quantity .
this is why the eu must play the main role in managing the delicate situation in the area .
institutions must be strengthened to avoid chaos and ensure stable development .
kosovo must not be isolated from the european processes in any way .
kosovo stands as a warning to eu member states as well .
the kosovo albanians were given the opportunity for a european style solution .
it would be embarrassing if certain eu member states were to lag behind kosovo and serbia in this respect .
however , in the given circumstances , what is important is that the european union successfully completes the mission .
however , situations need to be avoided where the eu's involvement is prolonged ad infinitum .
kosovo's declaration of independence has also exposed a schism amongst member states .
we in the european union have a moral duty to help , but this assistance should never be open ended .
we await an explanation .
there is no follow up organisation .
in this respect , too , I would call on the commission to finally appoint someone .
i am also opposed to us continuing to make excuses for the uncertain status of this state .
there is no easy solution .
they clarified the issues raised regarding eu funding and the way this has been managed in kosovo .
we should be proud of europe's record .
in the short time since then , the situation has become more serious .
of course , the primary responsibility for responding to these challenges rests with the industry itself .
it also needs to respect some key principles , such as fair competition and open markets .
this will be headed by my colleague martin říman and vice president of the commission , günter verheugen .
i would like to underline the second half of the sentence , also in the current context .
i can but confirm everything that was said , although I would also counsel caution at the same time .
why is this the case ?
thedrop in demand is a symptom of a lack of confidence in the way the economy is heading .
the european motor industry employs 12 million people directly and indirectly .
last year , this figure was nearly one million lower and it will fall again significantly in 200there are currently stockpiles of 2 million unsold vehicles .
in simple terms , then , it is a key industry for europe .
the plight of commercial vehicles is much more dramatic .
the industry itself concedes an overcapacity of 20 % .
the industry is required to make considerable strides in terms of innovation .
our policy now is pursuing two goals at the same time .
i would like to mention just one example in this regard .
it is just not possible to do this .
scrapping premiums , as you can imagine , are not possible in this sector .
we have already done all of this .
that is a question that must be directed at the united states , in particular .
we will see what measures president obama puts in place to counter the crisis in the us motor industry .
we are witnessing an extraordinary contradiction .
what happens is that each country acts independently .
credit , then , is the answer , but as we were saying , the important thing is how .
the financial crisis has therefore hit car manufacturing particularly hard .
innovation cannot be achieved by getting rid of the workers .
let us dare to do what common sense dictates before it is too late .
let us finally bury this damaging treaty and stop playing at pyromaniac firefighters .
by and large , however , the motor industry's banks have been left out .
a recovery task force has been set up in my area involving all major regional actors .
only a tiny fraction of that fund was used last year .
for this reason it is a very important sector for the well being of our citizens .
that is coming back to haunt them now .
i will give you an example from germany , my home country , of how not to do it .
volvo and saab are well known makes .
it has got to give the impression that it is in the driving seat to solve the problem .
the industry is already in serious trouble .
these environmental and other standard restrictions make cars more expensive .
you are helping to kill off an industry which is already in serious bother .
there has never been a situation where sales have collapsed so quickly .
we have the incentives to invest in those new cars that ms harms and others want .
the problem is actually getting buyers and demand back into the economy .
we do not want a competitive race between businesses .
the president cut off the speaker 
the decisions are taken in detroit , and all opel sites are faced with overproduction .
this was the case for coal and steel .
thirdly , accelerate the renewal of the vehicles on the road .
first and foremost , we must prevent distortions of the internal market .
i call on the commission to submit measures for a european scrapping scheme as quickly as possible .
through funding research and development , through supporting investment .
however , in this case , 12 members requested the floor .
mr vondra now has the floor to respond to the various speeches on behalf of the council .
the same applies to the other automobile makers and industries in asia .
it is not quite as black and white as you might think , therefore .
i would ask you in all seriousness not to pursue this idea any further .
similarly , there can be no european regulation that the level of the premium must be the same everywhere .
that is what was decided .
of course , this rule can be changed .
thank you very much , mr konrad , for your contribution it has been well noted .
the government of malta is claiming that reimbursement will amount to millions of euros .
it accounts for 3 % of the eu's gdp and generates a commercial surplus of eur 35 billion .
there are limits to what can be expected from the european investment bank .
will we have a budget equal to the challenges facing europe ?
the european union's economy is reputed to be the greatest economic power in the world .
one of these consequences is that it is difficult to define which car manufacturers are truly european .
the serious situation at european level requires the immediate introduction of suitable measures .
this is a key aspect for strategic investors , such as those in the car market .
consular protection of citizens of the european union in third countries debate 
the treaties provide us with a basis for this cooperation .
since the jolo crisis in 2000 , consular cooperation has been further developed to include aspects of crisis management .
the council has recently developed thelead stateconcept .
the main operational tool is the eu joint situation centre sitcen of the council secretariat .
in addition , successive presidencies have organised regular consular crisis management exercises which have proved particularly valuable .
support for improved cooperation in the consular field is not always matched by adequate budgets at the national level .
they will certainly be telling us something of their experiences in mumbai last december .
i do not think that what has been said to date is satisfactory .
every citizen has the right to consular protection .
member states have a duty to put an end to this situation .
it is necessary to make guidelines binding and to make information available to citizens .
furthermore , police forces co operate with each other .
in a crisis , a european citizen loses his or her european status .
as europeans , they do not exist outside the european union .
in the best case scenario , consuls help each other .
it is a pertinent question .
we should expand the concept of european solidarity .
more work needs to be done there .
there was no real sharing of information and intelligence , not the sort of cooperation I expected to see .
de mr president , mr karim is absolutely right .
the problem is in the very wording , in the fundamentals of article 20 itself .
we cannot even actually agree on what article 20 means .
where are these ?
i searched consular protection on the europa website and found nothing .
without a doubt , the right to consular protection is currently fragmentary and unevenly distributed .
es mr president , ladies and gentleman , consular protection is a fundamental part of european citizenship .
citizens expect actions and not just words from the union .
the right to consular protection in third countries is one of the main features of european union citizenship .
question time council 
the next item is question time b6 0006 / 2009 .
the following questions have been submitted to the council .
subject smes
since we are running rather late , I propose that the council reply to all the supplementary questions together .
this is a common language in this parliament .
you mentioned , minister , the administrative burden and the goal of reducing it by 25 % by 20do you really think that is an ambitious goal ?
what are your aims ?
that would be rather ambitious .
this plan is providing a sum of eur 30 billion for small and medium sized enterprises .
the commission advised us that grants will be awarded on thefirst come , first servedprinciple .
on the late payment directive , the commission intends to publish the proposal at the end of february 200the presidency will start discussing the issue at the council's preparatory bodies .
where , then , is the problem ?
in november the commission proposed a revision of the directive on the energy efficiency of buildings .
the aim of the examination is to explore difficulties in the proposal .
we expect that the question of the scope of the directive will be put on the table first .
adequate attention will also be paid to the recent ukraine russia gas dispute and its consequences .
the others are also important , but either in the long term or without such a huge impact .
the second one is nuclear energy , but I know this is a sensitive issue for some member states .
lt thank you for your explanation of a very important subject .
thus , as you begin the presidency , how do you evaluate this project ?
i think , in this respect , ukraine is serving us as the only terrestrial supplier .
the question is about the state of the ratification process in the czech republic .
the ratification process should be concluded if we find enough votes in parliament .
i do not mean to make him paranoid with my question .
i am anti smoking , not anti smokers .
we all agree they need all the help they can get nicotine replacement therapies etc .
it would be extremely important if you could give me guarantees on that .
they are amazing really .
my wife smoked as well and she still smokes .
but I can assure you that the government will do whatever it can to obtain ratification of both treaties .
that concludes questions to the council .
it is also an ecological disaster .
possibilities may include through the eu solidarity fund or a reprogramming of the structural and rural development funds .
the 2003 heatwave claimed tens of thousands of lives .
while parliament largely supported the commission proposal , there has been no progress in the council .
i took note , mrs vassiliou , of the commission's wish to speed things up .
there is also an urgent need with regard to the forest .
we must show them our solidarity and assist with rebuilding the natural heritage of these regions .
mrs vassiliou , we have all remained enthusiastic about this report as it contains highly practical and concrete proposals .
it even contains budgetary items and explains that 10 % of the solidarity fund can provide funding .
it explains in a most pragmatic way how to work with the stakeholders in each state .
you have just told us , mrs vassiliou , that you hope to receive parliament's support .
faced with all this , what is europe doing ?
the juxtaposition of 27 navels does not yet make for a great continental project .
we suffer the consequences of this during every tragedy .
we are told tocall for solidarity, but using which funds ?
this storm alone has cost eur 1.4 billion .
still today , we are continuing to discuss the need to mobilise european stakeholders when a tragedy strikes .
we can see a need for a european agricultural insurance fund against climate and health risks .
the french presidency talked about this , and the czech presidency should do likewise .
furthermore , a lot of debris of all kinds has been deposited in rivers , streams and other watercourses .
there are victims in france and spain and this evening we think of them and their families .
200 000 hectares of forest have been destroyed in the south west of france .
many roads are still impassable due to obstacles such as fallen trees , power lines , floods or landslips .
now , this is a situation where , ultimately , several countries are affected .
therefore , I think that this threshold should also be reviewed to show that european solidarity really can exist .
the commission has already announced a communication on adapting to climate change .
it is time europe showed that , in tragic situations , it is there to protect its citizens .
this is the third catastrophic storm in 20 years .
the first one , as you will remember , was in july 1988 , in brittany .
obviously , I sympathise with what mrs laperrouze has said .
galicia has the highest density of forested land in the european union .
i saw , along with everyone else , what the dramatic consequences were in the wake of storm klaus .
they just allowed people to die , week after week .
that is why I fully share both your sentiments and your concerns .
in most cases , this must be done by an on the spot visit .
farmers like to buy ingredients and to mix their own rations , and generally larger farmers do this .
why do farmers not welcome inspectors in , seeing them as protectors of their businesses ?
it would appear that the factory concerned which produced the feed had not inspected for some time .
thus , the oil is diluted and added to the feedstuffs .
this is bad news in the current difficult economic climate .
i think maybe it is worse , sometimes looking back at the history of pcbs .
and there is confusion about other things .
it is no surprise that there is considerable anger amongst those affected constituents .
the logical question is why did this not happen earlier ?
yet there are still problems in this area .
yes , we do want to make use of surplus foodstuffs .
unwanted substances and products must be excluded in a secure and controlled manner .
that will be proven not to be the case , so let us be careful what we say here .
i would also like to point out to jim allister that this is a cross border issue .
as a practician , I would say that everything that is being said in this regard is nonsense .
madam president , there is no dispute about the fact that the oil apparently came from northern ireland .
that is not the issue .
let us allow the due process of the legal investigation to take its course .
there is a legal and police investigation .
we cannot deny that .
this is ordinary people suffering , and it is our farmers who are suffering financially .
so I would have thought that a prudent member state would have taken more stringent control measures .
the budget for that measure is eur 6.9 million .
the sitting was closed at 10.45 p.m. 
the placing on the market and use of feed for animals debate 
the commission presented a proposal , which subsequently became directive 2002 / 2 / ec .
the compromise package maintains the high level of feed safety achieved in the eu .
the provisions concerning the so calledopen declarationallow for a more modern type of labelling .
many of us have drunk coca cola for many years .
when cattle feed manufacturers decide to innovate , they should not be impeded by excessively strict legislation on disclosure .
in short , the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe will be backing this compromise .
it has gone wrong and we must ensure it does not go wrong again .
it is a good example of parliament working .
moreover , the most inquisitive among us will even be able to request the exact composition .
i know it is a very simplistic approach to take , but that is exactly why we are here .
pl mr president , commissioner , I heartily congratulate mr graefe zu baringdorf on another excellent report .
the regulation must bolster consumer confidence throughout the european food chain .
clear and precise regulations will not help unless they are complied with in practice .
sadly , the answer isno.
it is , after all , unacceptable for one country to be stricter than another .
finally , I should like to mention a topic that cannot remain untouched , namely meat and bone meal .
meat and bone meal in animal feed has been banned since the bse crisis .
cannibalism never again !
we need to put tests in place in order to handle this situation properly .
only when a patent office grants a protection certificate is a product protected .
industry will do everything for profit .
i endorse the idea of drawing up a list of ingredients which may not be fed to animals .
we ought to ask why the monitoring system did not function correctly and why the contamination arose .
the system of monitoring therefore requires greater supervision .
the food in europe is safe .
we need the same controls for the same risks throughout the european union .
within the european union , there are , in fact , 5 million farmers and 60 million pet owning households .
the issue of rogue operators has been brought up in the debate here this morning .
mr president , I should like to make two quick points .
i would agree with all those who said , as I confirmed , that european food is safe .
i believe this is a good report .
i am fairly sure that this will also curb criminal activity .
we wanted to prevent the duty of information from hiding behind these intellectual property rights .
that is why this is a good arrangement .
here , too , this was very successful .
the debate is closed .
i would like to stress the importance of the issues addressed in this report .
i would prefer that partnership approach to continue on a voluntary basis .
it certainly does not exclude other international organisations , such as the international organisation of vine and wine .
i look forward to the discussion here today .
we must be careful to avoid contradiction here .
it is important that there is additional aid , especially for projects selected by the member states .
we will therefore vote in favour of this report .
a campaign to promote these products will benefit both european consumers and romanian agricultural producers .
in a crisis situation , member states must focus greater attention when setting their priorities .
agriculture is one such area and the european union can make a significant contribution to promoting it .
the question of our standards has got to be acknowledged and recognised .
is that being acknowledged and recognised at the wto ?
mr president , I very strongly support promotion of our high quality food .
commissioner , I would like to endorse what you said .
we have got to go out there and promote our high quality products .
i would like to take this opportunity to respond to some of the questions or issues raised here .
that would be a bad outcome and that is the reason why we have maintained our proposal .
we are now digesting all these different ideas and we will present a communication in may .
once again , my thanks to the rapporteur , mr dumitriu , for a very good report .
thank you for the extremely relevant comments and views you have expressed about this report .
my response is positive on both counts .
indeed , the report's provisions do not exclude other areas .
to finally sum up , there are two reasons why this report is necessary .
i repeat once again we have a collective responsibility .
explanations of vote
mr president , thank you again for giving me the floor .
economic partnership agreements are very key as a development instrument .
well , a paragraph of this nature is in contravention of the principle of subsidiarity .
mr president , whence comes our obsession with preserving multi ethnic states regardless of the wishes of their inhabitants ?
i wanted to draw attention to a very positive development in the committee on foreign affairs .
on the whole , trade with china is to be welcomed .
i support the dumitriu report and welcome the inclusion of the wine sector within the scope of this proposal .
the question must be asked as to whether the one upmanship within the european institutions is not misplaced .
yes , and this is the meaning of selective immigration , which president sarkozy wholeheartedly recommends .
the criticism directed at a number of so called reception centres is justified .
the essential aim of the report is that the eu should have a common immigration and asylum policy .
the principal reason for this position relates to access to the labour market for asylum seekers .
the report which mrs muscardini has presented concerns an important economic and social question .
over 75 million people work in these smes .
this is because they are more flexible and open to modern technologies and organisational methods .
it is for this reason that conservatives reluctantly voted against this report .
even so , we know that some of them cannot and will not be able to withstand the competition .
e commerce is an excellent commercial opportunity for small and medium sized enterprises and for young entrepreneurs .
this includes measures designed to discourage and prevent fraud and theft of personal data .
at the same time , community standards must be defined for e commerce transactions .
i voted in favour of mr papastamkos's report on international trade and the internet .
it is plain to see that international trade and the internet are mutually beneficial .
the protection of intellectual property must not favour abuses .
the commission is making epas the alpha and omega of its development strategy .
supporting as we do the countries concerned , the european socialists do not endorse this approach .
this is not theroad mapdescribed in the schröder report .
despite this , I back the alternative resolution tabled by the group of the greens / european free alliance .
moreover , a separate body is non transparent and would prevent a holistic approach to development related topics .
i am sceptical as to whether kosovo was ready for independence .
democracy requires us , above all , to look at the needs and desires of the people themselves .
if they are not allowed to annex to albania , they want true independence .
independence for kosovo is something that can only be achieved by consensus and agreement with serbia .
this means that sadly , I cannot support it .
in writing . this report reflects china's growing power as a trading nation .
given my support for taiwan's meaningful participation in international organisations , I voted in favour of this report .
china was number two on the eu's trade partners list in 200the list is getting longer and it is frightening .
china currently accounts for 6 % of world trade .
if this can be maintained in the future it will only help boost china's development .
it is understandable .
the breakdown in negotiations with envoys of the dalai lama casts a shadow over relations with china .
china should cease all forms of persecution of the tibetan people .
in writing . this report mentions china's growing trade with taiwan , which I welcome .

situation in sri lanka
a hospital has even come under fire and , according to humanitarian organisations , the overall situation is disastrous .
recently , a journalist was killed .
the eu should also ensure resources are put at sri lanka's disposal to support post conflict development .
author . madam president , sri lanka has been afflicted by internal fighting for decades .
that is why it is not in the resolution before you .
in fact , things are much more complex .
there were around 500 people in the hospital at the time it was bombarded by artillery .
the terrified people are afraid to flee , despite the 48 hour cease fire announced by the government .
the government predicts that victory over the tamils is near .
we call on both sides of the conflict to minimise civilian losses and to commence peace negotiations .
fighting between government forces and the ltte has further escalated .
there is a lack of medical care and of food .
the launch of a peace process is in the interests of everyone including the tamils .
security and stability must not remain a pipe dream for sri lankans .
this has to stop .
foreign observers must have access to the area in order to assess humanitarian needs .
although the government has promised to investigate the attack on journalists , that is no solution .
i want to add support to what previous speakers have said about an immediate cease fire .
it has a longer history of democracy than 22 of the 27 member states of the eu .
the commission continues to be convinced that there can be no military solution to sri lanka's ethnic conflict .
the vote will take place at the end of the debates .
they pursue autonomy and organise protests against the central dictatorship .
very often , refugees are sent home , even if this means certain death .
mr nicolaides has apologised to the thai royal family and has made an appeal for royal grace .
the abuse and lack of international coordinated action to help the rohingya must be addressed .
the thai prime minister must act .
the thai government must sign the 1951 un convention relating to the status of refugees and the 1967 protocol .
as joel chamy , vice president of washington based refugees international , said , the rohingya need protection and asylum .
the muslim ethnic minority is also being persecuted by the ruling military regime in burma .
this problem mainly concerns the rohingya ethnic minority , who live in the western part of the country .
madam president , today this house adopted a report on minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers .
for thailand , the survivorsaccounts are damning , to say the least .
thailand hosts approximately 140 000 refugees in nine camps along the border .
the complexity of these issues requires a comprehensive political , humanitarian , economic and social solution .
the vote will take place at the end of the debates .
sorry , I forgot to mention something important .
i hope that the proceedings in brazil will be concluded very quickly .
the lula administration has made a particular commitment to human rights .
however , I am here .
is this right or have I misunderstood ?
the text should readcease fire.
that may explain why there was some confusion .
could we switch the voting list around ?
i do apologise , but I have things down in the wrong order on my list .
madam president , in order to be correct , I think we have to vote on recital k now .
before the vote 
it is not just today that it has happened .
fr madam president , you are absolutely right .
the matter has a broader political dimension .
i cannot go against procedure , mr onesta .
it poses a great danger to the security and stability of the international community .
in memory of piotr stańczak , can I ask you all now to rise to commemorate him .
seven leading figures in the bahá í religious community were taken into custody in may 200for eight months , they were denied the opportunity of legal counsel .
on behalf of the european parliament , I protest to the strongest possible degree about these methods .

order of business
the following amendments have been proposed 
wednesday 
mr president , with your permission , we will also move to defer mr berman's report .
does anyone wish to oppose the motion ?
ladies and gentlemen , you have heard the political contexts .
the decision will be taken tomorrow .
we will vote on mr swoboda's motion tomorrow .
role of the european union in the middle east debate 
it is at the heart of our middle east policy .
all our actions have this strategic objective in mind .
we know that solutions and proposals should be locally inspired .
however , at the same time , deeper international engagement remains essential .
it remains , and should remain , on the table .
we have just had important elections in israel .
but it is clear that no single country or organisation can tackle the conflicts in the middle east alone .
in the coming months , we will also have elections in iran and in lebanon .
let me conclude by saying that 2009 will be critical for the middle east .
however , the time has come to focus decisively on conflict resolution .
it is the only way to end this endless sequence of death and destruction .
we also agreed that the quartet should consult closely on these matters before the end of the month .
finally , we need to step up our own engagement with the arab league countries .
much very delicate work is going on .
we are in regular contact with quartet colleagues .
we , as the commission , will be a co sponsor of this event .
we will certainly continue to work very closely with this house .
applause 
the embargo imposed on gaza means each delivery of humanitarian aid has to get through an obstacle course .
the hospitals can no longer operate properly .
the european union is already playing a major role in the region .
there is no solution through terrorism .
it may be the case that one party gains a short term military advantage .
to what extent is it prepared to engage in constructive dialogue , before and after the election in lebanon ?
without a unity government for the palestinians , the peace process is unmanageable .
in the middle east , everything is interconnected .
that is why the basis for everything is the readiness to talk .
this is a bold and ambitious plan , and it is one that needs to be discussed .
for this reason , our message can only be that dialogue is the precondition .
your work deserves more than respect .
we cannot go on like this .
last month's violence and the outcome of this month's election have changed the terms of the debate .
isolation has led only to despair .
its envoy , tony blair , has never even been to gaza .
there should be a free and fair international investigation into alleged war crimes in the gaza conflict .
however , the failure of our approach to date is written in spilled blood on the ground .
there is no such thing as anintelligentorsafebomb .
well , I agree .
israel refused the offer of the arab league in 2002 , ladies and gentlemen .
it has been in existence for seven years .
what has europe done to seize this opportunity ?
it should , however , be up to those who do the damage to pay .
i was one of the four people who worked on that programme .
therefore , we fully support those who are working to make the peace initiative a reality .
we see deep divisions within the arab league .
mr president , honourable members , as I have said , 2009 will be an enormously important year .
in any case , however , one thing is sure a military solution is no solution .
be assured that we will work for that .
the vote will take place today .
the humanitarian situation in gaza is unacceptable .
what are the principles by which it should be guided ?
the situation affecting gaza's population is tragic and must be resolved urgently .
role of the european union in the middle east vote 
i have been asked to welcome a visiting delegation in the gallery from the region of piedmont .
this aid must be provided without any conditions or restrictions .
what the heroic palestinian people need more than anything is not charity from the imperialists .
over 100 000 people have been displaced and more than 15 000 homes have been destroyed .
however , it is also essential to denounce the aggressors and hold them responsible .

in this year's report , we have decided to focus on policy making and policy shaping .
we are grateful this is a real achievement .
we regret , therefore , that as in previous years , the cfsp budget is seriously under funded .
we address horizontal and geographical issues in our report .
it should not be trying to duplicate them .
this is an important first step along the road .
we always speak of the security interests of the individual countries , but we do have common security interests .
if that is what we want , we will need the funds to bring it about .
we then make clear statements about the capabilities that we need to develop .
the events of the second world war gave birth to the eu .
mr solana has this number , which mr kissinger asked for years ago .
but what kinds of means are we member states and politicians giving to mr solana ?
we are talking about the toxic assets of banks and how we have to clear them .
we have to move on the eu has to move on in its peacebuilding .
we are day to day politicians who are short sighted .
what is the result of inefficient and failing security policies ?
we have idealism but we do not equip ourselves with the means to reach those targets .
what do we have to do ?
that was really when we began working on esdp .
i think that what I have said will resonate with the chairman of the committee on foreign affairs .
i think this is an important concept to keep in mind .
as you know , we have updated it in cooperation with the commission and parliament in 200let me say a word about piracy because that relates to our youngest operation , atalanta .
this maritime operation against piracy is conducted from a european operational headquarters in the united kingdom .
let me say a word about structures internal structures relating to esdp .
civilian action is not possible without a secure environment .
let me say a word about nato european union relations because they are covered in the report by mr vatanen .
as you know , we have a framework for cooperation that we call berlin plus .
without any doubt , this is going to be one of the most important issues facing us in 200we have to deliver and to deliver in a sensible manner .
more engagement will be needed .
i have had the opportunity to meet richard holbrooke already a couple of times , and general petraeus .
at this point , it is very important that we do better because we want to be better .
in georgia , additional eu post conflict financial support is being provided .
this exceptional ec assistance has contributed to preventing a major humanitarian crisis .
in chad , we have committed a total of eur 311 million under the 10th european development fund .
turning to energy , the gas crisis affecting the eu this year was unprecedented in its effect .
with regard to energy security , it is clear that we have lessons to draw .
but we will try to go and do what these expectations require from us .
it relates to developments in connection with the missile defence system in poland and the czech republic .
these are things that we welcome .
my group is opposed to glossing over our own work .
mr solana , you are absolutely right .
so what is it that we are talking about , then ?
this report discusses a new concept safe .
we believe this is wrong .
what is needed is the disbandment of nato .
we will therefore be voting against these two reports .
this is essential , after all .
someone spoke about helicopters .
the helicopter has today become an essential crisis management tool .
fi mr president , ladies and gentlemen , my thanks go to the three rapporteurs .
china and india are growing , not only in economic power , but also in military might .
europe's competitive advantage should be based on knowledge and innovation .
this should be nurtured and supported by all of us .
innovation creates new business and jobs .
it is a political tool in the advancement of an integrated europe .
this would actually be helpful .
there is nothing new in what is now fashionably calledthe comprehensive approach.
we used to call ithearts and minds.
concerning the mediterranean , we have objected to a reductionist approximation that only talks about security .
respect is needed for the position of the republic of cyprus .
that approach is antiquated .
indeed , this is also mentioned repeatedly in the report by mr saryusz wolski .
we have the resources .
will we , one day , have the will ?
the so called european diplomacy did not join the prior talks aimed at securing his release .
mr von wogau advocates an eu standing army of 60 000 soldiers permanently available for deployment .
ladies and gentlemen , you are completely inconsistent .
we are their friends , but we do not wish to be their vassals and still less their lackeys .
we have to put an end to this and get out of it .
nato has had its time .
i would therefore ask you to please keep to your speaking times .
the new administration has made a very positive start , also symbolically by the announcement to close down guantánamo .
this brings the european union in immediately .
these countries must be allowed to decide themselves on their security policy solutions , without any pressure from outside .
it is the superpowers of the united states and russia who are active in these areas , not europe !
the message from this parliament is unequivocal and serves as a warning .
europe's role as a global player in crisis management may be threatened .
at the time , the european community was powerless .
in other words , the european union as a global player is the desired solution .
it is my view that these negotiations should also include discussions on the topic of missile defence .
consensus exists about this among the main political forces .
secondly , I would like to emphasise the question of human rights in the development of eu external policy .
the policy should support international law international humanitarian law , liberal democracy and the rule of law .
secondly , on institutions .
i feel that the european union and nato must cooperate with each other , avoiding any potential rivalry .
i would like to hear something from you on this subject .
perhaps he is not listening .
not much , apart from act as witnesses .
firstly , I would like to stress the importance of the transatlantic aspect to the eu's foreign policy .
we know this is a very important part .
i will certainly be in touch with you to respond to those who have to be responded to properly .
is it enough ?
is there more convergence between institutions like parliament , council , the commission and member states ?
the answer isno.
how does this like mindedness come about ?
the question of values was raised .
do we agree on values ?
this is a very real risk I can envisage .
therefore , I do support these two concepts , but not for the security policy .
then there is the european security strategy , which now has everyone's support .
the work that needed to be done on this took several years and was very successful .
anybody of sound mind is a pacifist .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 february 200written statements rule 142 
the ratification of the lisbon treaty and the foreign policy tools outlined therein may contribute greatly to this goal .
yet it is not a position that europe could or should have followed .
we , in our own and their interests , must have the capacity to engage without the americans .
let us allow some time to pass , however , and just see how nato develops .
we also need regional security and close ties with the relevant regional players .
international security is one of the greatest values for all the subjects of international relations .
without a solution to these fundamental questions , creation of a stable european security strategy is not possible .
this would definitely be a solution for the turkey issue from nato's point of view .
thank you !
the nabucco project must be adopted as a strategic goal by the whole eu .
the barcelona process union for the mediterranean debate 
these approaches together encourage reform within individual countries , and reinforce regional cooperation .
the first is interparliamentary cooperation through the creation of the euro mediterranean parliamentary assembly and its committees .
it will , as is pointed out in your resolution , serve to reinforce its democratic legitimacy .
it will also help promote the basic values which lie at the heart of the european union .
the second area which I believe should be a particular priority for us is the development of intercultural relations .
civil society , local social and regional partners all need to be involved .
there is , therefore , no reason to call it into question today .
the opening of the secretariat in barcelona has been postponed indefinitely , and the money promised cannot come in .
it is precisely because political conflicts are blocking this process that we should strengthen the economic field .
communicating the benefits of economic integration to local citizens will play an important role in this .
i wish to see this for the sake of us all , particularly the citizens in the region .
first , to guarantee the continuity of the barcelona process with the union for the mediterranean .
this is what the union for the mediterranean is , after all .
and who knows ?
thank you , mrs napoletano , for this excellent report .
it was a conference on water .
this is how crucial it is .
certainly , the union for the mediterranean is a significant step forward in the efforts for the euro mediterranean partnership .
let me give you an example .
this fragmentation makes visibility suffer .
pt my thanks go to my colleague , pasqualina napoletano , for her excellent report .
although we can only learn through our mistakes , making progress by speeding up the reaction is absolutely crucial .
in truth , this union was born during the french presidency under the star sign of mistakes .
there are also clear rules on the programme agreements and a euro mediterranean investment bank .
the question raised concerns how we can pursue this strategy .
the model followed in barcelona has not had the expected results .
mrs napoletano's report goes against this perception .
however , we do not want the union to suffer the same problem as the barcelona process .
it apparently encompasses many projects and many areas of action , but the priorities are not correctly ranked .
finally , mr president , I must mention the middle east conflict .
the list of speakers has been exhausted .
regional cooperation is most needed in the area of tackling threats to the environment .
finally , I simply want to stress the concern about poverty and social exclusion , which seriously affect women .
you have prepared a really interesting document .
we just need to move .
there are the resources which , as far as I know , come to over eur 1 billion .
do not worry then .
that is the only difference .
moreover , when mrs kratsa went to marseille , we gave her a lot of support on this issue .
thank you all for this debate .
the baltic sea strategy will be one of the priorities under the swedish presidency .
the eu is an integrated community and the long term strategic development of all its regions has equal importance .
regrettably , there are still several countries that have serious problems in this domain .
the fundamental freedoms of free movement of labour and free trade are being put to the test .
the crisis is following different paths in different countries .
mr president , I received some strange news from northern ireland last week .
however , this month corticeira amorim has announced that nearly 200 workers will be laid off .
polish legislation does not give meps any legal instruments which ensure the effective fulfilment of their mandate .
i believe it is important that the positive role of europe must be highlighted through our education systems .
es mr president , a year and a half ago , we adopted the audiovisual media directive .
citizens of hungarian origin are represented proportionally in the local administrative structures .
we need country of origin labelling so consumers are able to make informed choices .
this is a de facto and de jure situation .
the czech page about germany displays köln as kolín , while the french page displays cologne .
buildings are responsible for 40 % of the consumption of primary energy .
it can pick you up but it is addictive and leads to economic death . 
de mr president , I should like to put forward two suggestions .
i think that this is a pity , and that it is a bad habit .
and I think that the president should react to this situation .
the eastern partnership is a timely answer to the expectations of our european neighbours to the east .
it is very difficult to see russia as a partner in this area .
the preliminary findings of our review point exactly in the same direction .
moreover , instruments such as twinning and taiex provide support for institution building , legislative approximation and regulatory alignment .
there is always room for improvement and I am always grateful for suggestions .
however , let us be honest .
i think that is really true .
we have just heard about not creating one thing to the financial detriment of another .
that is why the capabilities of the neighbourhood instrument need to be promoted in the right way .
let us actively use these opportunities .
i ask the commission to take this concern into consideration .
how can we effectively review this neighbourhood and partnership instrument ?
our actions must always be well conceived so that citizens can see specific benefits from them .
this partnership significantly raises the level of commitment by both sides .
i am , of course , very thankful for many of the suggestions .
so , as you can see , we are nearly at the same level .
today , however , it is certainly important to add political content to our neighbourhood policy .
new financing discussions will begin this year .
this unprecedented economic crisis , which is biting hard , spells renewed disaster for developing countries .
whilst eu funding in this area is to be welcomed , it is not fighting poverty .
a financial source and a legal basis that do not come under development policy will need to be found .
this was in response to parliament's request during the final negotiations on the instruments .
the review is about the implementation of the instruments .
we recognise that there is a problem with non oda activities .
by their nature , such activities do not qualify as development assistance .
finally , I see that the report calls for more resources .
this should allow an adjustment of the different headingsceilings .
but , of course , sponsoring concert tours or athletestravel costs does not .
this much appreciated report deals with the results of those deficiencies .
i came to this debate because I was anxious to hear the arguments about legal bases .
let us just call a spade a spade .
the difficulty is that we are not .
small and medium sized enterprises have a very special role to play in this .
creditworthiness is particularly important during financial crises , so that these enterprises can still obtain microcredit .
perhaps I am concerned because I am a journalist .
written statements rule 142 
this alone , however , will not be enough .
the commission will make all possible efforts to support the implementation of these amendments by the council .
after all , it is also important that these research results continue to be presented and made available .
imagine if an international legal research framework had been established 50 years ago .
successful reforms then spread to other countries .
my questions are as follows .
ro 2009 is the european year of creativity and innovation .
i would be interested in taking two minutes , if that was in order ?
well , you present me with a quandary .
the rules of procedure state one minute .
one minute .
i want just two minutes I do not know about the other colleagues .
thank you for allowing me to trespass on your patience , mr president .
i have two quick points .
when there were collapses in their gdp , the public sector investment in r & d went up .
i will refer here to a statement made by mrs doyle .
therefore , I endorse the measures concerning the establishment of a legal framework for the european research infrastructure .
the question of appropriate taxation is also important in this case .
i trust , therefore , that the eri will improve this situation .
member of the commission . mr president , firstly I would like to thank you for your support .
i may not follow the order of the questions but will try to respond briefly to what you asked .
on the cost of patent application , it is very striking .
betterwould certainly be an answer which would be more horizontal than anything which we could do .
it is not intended that we finance institutionally the infrastructure .
that is really the only way ahead .
we do not propose vat exemption in the legislation .
today , the countries are individually negotiating with the host country on that kind of exemption .
the answer is yes .
to finish , that is exactly the point which we have to underline .
we need infrastructure .
this is the step to speed up the whole process .
we now come to our rapporteur , mrs riera madurell .
we take note of this comment .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 february 200written statements rule 142 
this gives the community the ability to participate in and guide trans european research policies .
establishing european research infrastructures guarantees that research will reach a high level .
the cost of establishing large scale research infrastructures requires several countries to join forces .
a special place for children in eu external action short presentation 
i think it is both comprehensive and ambitious .
commissioner , I now look forward very much to seeing actions intended to match the ambition which I see .
we need to see substance backing up the rhetoric .
we recognise that the eu needs a strategy on children .
the committee on development then started drafting a report .
we will surely use it in our work on children .
how do we ensure that we involve children in decisions that concern them ?
how do we ensure that children have access to pertinent information ?
this is just the start of a long process .
we should build on the collective force of the two institutions to advance this important issue .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 february 200written statements rule 142 
undertake a thorough analysis of children's rights 
build up existing youth and children's networks as sustainable platforms for consulting children 
i have taken a particular interest in the issue of children's rights in the context of foreign relations .
i succeeded in introducing statements condemning gender based eugenic discrimination , which is increasingly common in some countries .
they represent 99 % of companies and employ over 100 million people .
workersrights to information and consultation are essential components of the social market economy .
we proposed the recasting of the directive on european work councils .
this has been successfully completed .
the item is closed .
my report has three objectives .
it can , I believe , help to sustain our social systems when times are hard .
the third objective is to decide what we can do in practice to support this sector .
where and at what level should consultation and dialogue with the european commission take place ?
it is up to the commission to assess this .
the item is closed .
this is a grass roots vision that represents a fundamental contribution to the european social model .
such institutions cannot be replaced by any market oriented organisation .
if this concept is unknown to society , its solidarity is unable to help .
participating organisations , on the other hand , are too small to become known on a macro economic level .
the social economy ensures job stability as it is not subject to delocalisation .
mental health short presentation 
vulnerable and marginalised groups , such as disabled people , are more likely to suffer mental health problems .
we call on the commission to present the conclusions of the thematic conferences .
employers are increasingly aware of the links between wellbeing and productivity .
csr europe has even created a toolkit for wellbeing in the workplace .
these will be joint events with council presidencies and member states .
parliament's report includes many concrete suggestions which constitute a valuable contribution to future debates in these conferences .
the item is closed .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 february 200written statements rule 142 
one in four people suffer from mental health problems at least once in their life .
awareness of this issue should therefore be raised among businesses and public bodies .
you pointed out that we have slightly dimmed the lighting in the chamber .
commissioner , the gas crisis in january certainly had one positive outcome .
let us also remember that improving energy efficiency can also reduce the burden on the most vulnerable consumers .
at the same time , our goal was to define necessary future steps in eu legislation .
what is more , energy efficiency programmes can create hundreds of thousands of jobs in europe .
in a year of massive layoffs , this aspect is hardly beside the point .
we could and should try to change the situation through diversification and solidarity .
it is essential that member states which are most dependent on energy supplies have sufficient reserves of these supplies .
i also urge the commission to support national authorities , particularly in the form of technical assistance .
it is vital that we establish interesting and rewarding university courses that offer good professional opportunities .
i think that is how research should be done in the future .
this is what this is all about , after all .
it is my firm belief that the experiment has proven its effect beyond any doubt .
he took the view that tax policy was not intended for this purpose .
it was deleted in amendment 6 and re introduced in amendment this can only create confusion .
therefore , further extensions of the scope of the proposal should not be considered in this context .
we are now tabling the text for a resolution , which is a good thing .
as usual , I will politely , but firmly , reject her call .
we had made a great effort to compromise .
she did not think it was worth making the slightest effort to accept any of our proposals .
that is ridiculous .
why complicate matters ?
why look for public health issues where there is no reason for there to be any ?
this measure supporting the food industry is becoming increasingly necessary , madam president .
if we think that the commission's proposal is good , then we must support it .
let us make use of it .
let us put an end to legal uncertainty and harmonise the basis on which member states can intervene .
you have struck the right balance and it is an intelligent one .
these are the right choices , according to two criteria .
we could also talk about mandeville and private vice for public virtue .
however , it has been rejected by the majority in the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
it will secure , and hopefully create , jobs .
of course , we on the left welcome the reduction in vat rates as a matter of principle .
high and very high earners must bear a greater tax burden .
this is something positive for a change from the grand coalition in the federal republic of germany .
of the amendments tabled , we support those that are in favour of extending the reduced vat rates .
greece is going to need bailing out but by whom ?
economies are in dire straits all over the world .
some of them will pull through .
lt the regulation of vat reductions has long been an area demanding a systemic approach .
price growth , which is disproportionate to an increase in vat , clearly shows who benefits .
i am pleased that the commission's proposal being debated is using a different evaluation of copenhagen economics .
wherever possible , therefore , the vat rate in the newly accepted countries should be as low as possible .
at this time of recession this can stimulate recovery , growth and jobs .
now back to report we are discussing today .
the building sector has the largest number of jobs .
this results in enormous budgetary losses and an increase in unregistered employment .
moreover , it will promote an increase in both productivity and employment .
perhaps we should do the opposite .
from the point of view of competitiveness , europe is a service economy .
compared with the usa , our sales tax , or value added tax , is much higher .
for the commission , there were two options .
in times of crisis , these measures can be an important incentive for a number of industries .
before the vote 
it was approved unanimously , with one vote against I think , in the committee on constitutional affairs .
community legal framework for a european research infrastructure eri 
european professional card for service providers 
this can form a nice little example to use in the election campaigns and I am therefore pleased .
the committee was unanimous on this issue and so that is all I have to say .
voting time
it is a great pleasure to welcome them here today .
the visitors have also had an opportunity to experience , at first hand , the workings of our parliament .
i wish the delegation well for the remainder of their stay in the european union .
reduced rates of value added tax 
although I have been here several times before I have never had the chance to address a plenary session .
you are surely well aware of this too , ladies and gentlemen .
history has no end point .
and those people include the citizens of the czech republic .
in a normal parliamentary system there is a group supporting the government and another supporting the opposition .
here only one alternative exists and those who dare consider other alternatives are labelled enemies of european integration .
the only solution lies in the liberalisation and deregulation of the european economy .
i say all this because I care about a democratic and prosperous future for europe .
i firmly believe that the citizens of the various member states want freedom , democracy and economic prosperity .
thank goodness that we live in a european democracy in which we can all express our opinions .
applause and uproar 
applause 
however , it is now the european parliament that decides .
the role of nato in the security architecture of the eu 
it is unconditional .
that is what we have to do .
on behalf of the ppe de group . madam president , I have two oral amendments to this paragraph .
please support this more european position .
i ask therefore for the application for referral back to committee to be withdrawn .
madam president , I would like to second the rapporteur .
mixed reactions 
president klaus was able to speak here unhindered .
we now continue with the vote .
however , I voted against the report , owing to its pro abortion stance .
it was written in 1989 , in an age before we knew about predators .
it also includes abortion , which has no place in children's rights .
he made a speech that was in some ways almost platitudinous .
what could be more social than making a profit to re invest to create jobs for your population ?
pl madam president , 90 % of suicides are the result of mental health problems .
they say that learning comes at a price and we have paid that price .
using the most up to date science as a tool can only help the task ahead of us .
how does a free society combat those who wish to destroy it ?
they did not succeed .
that will continue under the lisbon treaty .
that mandate expires on 15 march 200that really demonstrates the vital importance of nato and its maintenance .
how are we seeking to undermine this ?
let us not forget the vital role that nato has played long may it continue .
we will retain our neutrality under the lisbon treaty the treaty will not change our position on that .
that equal opportunities are still lacking ?
all they want to do is be negative and oppose everything .
alternative means of redress may be recommended .
the new rules will facilitate the processing of petitions , thereby supporting citizensinterests .
however , the june list is immovable in respect of the issue of tax policy .
i have therefore voted against the commission's proposal and the report .
it is therefore a useful tool for developing the fisheries industry .
i have voted against this motion for a resolution .
this is unacceptable .
for this reason all european employers and hired workers must know and recognise this european social model procedure .
in writing . I support this report which was initiated by the socialist group .
extending workforce size thresholds regardless of age or type of employment contract to cover all workers
social economy enterprises are characterised by a form of enterprise that differs from the capital enterprise model .
the third sector plays a leading role in the european economy , combining profitability and solidarity .
europeans dread losing their jobs and expect decent treatment .
i support the rapporteur's motion .
the european commission has withdrawn two proposals intended to put in place statutes for european mutual societies and associations .
a europe in which creativity is harnessed and the dignity of each citizen is protected for the common good .
i welcome this and have voted in favour of the report .
we need to consider some of the figures given by the report , particularly 
in writing . the tzampazi report deals with an important health issue .
similarly , it is said that by 2010 depression will become the most common illness in modern society .
the average figure for poor countries is 0.05 psychiatrists per 100 000 inhabitants .
the problem is exacerbated in very many countries by the migration of specialist medical staff .
one person in four will experience some form of mental health disorder at least once in their lives .
i welcome the result of this resolution .
we are employing energy ever more rationally .
more rational energy management has thus contributed to economic growth in all the member states .
in writing . sv we swedish social democrats have chosen to abstain .
the eu must act quickly to put an end to the problems of overfishing and threatened stocks .
this has to be the starting point and focus of the common fisheries policy .
this is obvious in view of this sector's economic , social and political importance in the eu .
in the long term , objectives will be more compatible .
this will result in the disappearance of whole species .
a definite environmental perspective should permeate all research in the fisheries sector .
i support the report's intention to facilitate the mobility of professionals and to guarantee the safety of consumers .
in writing . it madam president , I voted for the report .
employers must not be able to avoid applying labour law rules by utilising a complex chain of subcontractors .
we believe that people without documents are just as vulnerable , even if they are working for private individuals .
it was with this hope that I voted in favour of this report .
the proposal that we are voting on today has many shortcomings .
expulsion should not be the alternative to over exploitation of illegally staying migrant workers .
there are no measures in relation to the policy of expelling illegal immigrants back to their country of origin .
we reject this philosophy that is dangerous for the people and nations of europe .
the proposal to punish employers who use illegal citizens is timely .
there is an absence of this type of legislation in certain countries within the eu .
the proposal that we are voting on today has many shortcomings .
if the decision had been ours , many parts of it would have been different .
the current proposal exemplifies the measures taken .
the ball is now in the governmentscourt .
we stress that it is for member states to decide when it is appropriate to apply these measures .
islamist jihadi extremists pose a threat to our very way of life .
politicians have a responsibility to protect the public against this unprecedented and existentialist danger .
once again the anti americanism so prevalent in the eu put its citizenssafety in jeopardy .
that is why I will abstain .
it is equally telling that the uk labour members abstained .
this shifts the focus from the main issue , which is that of the suspected violations of human rights .
in writing . eplp meps believe that this resolution contains a number of points of merit .
taiwan is a prosperous democracy with a top quality public health system .
i welcome the report's positive comments about the improvement in cross straits relations .
nevertheless , I welcome the council's recent expression of support for taiwan's meaningful participation in international organisations .
i therefore voted to approve this report .
just like two others debated and adopted in this sitting , this report is also very ambitious .
cooperation with other countries plays an enormous role in this field .
in this regard , relations with russia , ukraine , georgia and belarus are worthy of note .
this is exactly as to be expected .
taiwan's exclusion from this body at the behest of china is reprehensible .
i voted to abstain on this report .
for these reasons , we abstained overall .
in writing . pl mr president , I supported mr von wogau's report .
our neighboursseemingly bilateral conflicts have a direct impact on the eu .
it actually goes even further as itcalls for the setting up of an . eu operational headquarters.
in writing . british labour meps joined with the socialist group in voting in favour of this report .
the report envisions further unacceptable transfer of national competence in defence and security to the eu .
strengthening the european union's military credibility is , however , indispensable .
i therefore elected to abstain .
the report states that nato forms the core of european security .
i believe that europe's security is enhanced by the eu's common foreign and security policy .
when the soviet union and the warsaw pact disappeared , this nato lost its raison d être .
its continued existence is a problem for the eu , because six member states have opted for military neutrality .
a first step towards this consolidation may be an operational headquarters for the european union .
the location of europe dictates its security priorities and concerns .
the usa and nato must be regarded as partners not as rivals .
clearly from time to time changes in global strategic interests mean adjusting priorities and approaches .
in this connection , separate , permanent structures have been put in place .
in writing . it madam president , ladies and gentlemen , I voted for this report .
however , overall we support the report and therefore have voted in favour .
these activities should expand the free trade zone .
this principle ought to extend to all the activities carried out by the publications office .
that concludes the explanations of vote .
resumption of the session
those who perpetrated these terrorist acts must be brought to justice and made to account for their horrific crimes .
their attacks do not command political support from the people of northern ireland .
such is what happens when you treat with terrorists .
we pay tribute to their legacy today .

order of business
then we would be able to vote on both requests on wednesday .
parliament approved the request 
parliament should simply take a clear position , to put an end to this debate once and for all .
i think he is right the commission's behaviour is certainly remarkable , to put it politely .
the second part is the resolution .
i now give the floor to mr fjellner , who may present a different position again .
de mr president , this should not be made any more complicated .
i believe that would be a further reaching request on which you could hold an initial vote .
the committee meets this evening , and the debate on the report remains on the agenda for wednesday .
thursday 
i therefore feel it is crucial that we not only talk but also take decisions .
for this reason we are requesting that a resolution be put to the vote in addition to the debate .
darfur is now an item on the agenda .
abuses of this kind must be stopped and the law must be enforced .
today , israel must not obstruct the will of the palestinian people .
applause 
this relates only to the association's list , however , not to the fund .
that cannot be allowed to happen !
that will mean an ability to manufacture nuclear weapons on an industrial scale .
there are certain things in this life for me which cannot be bought or sold .
this statement truly illustrates the will of and the path being taken by the workers .
i am glad that a charge of libel has been filed regarding this matter .
interestingly , no such accusations have been levelled against the old member states .
the world then will not forget , but mere words will have little effect , madam president .
the developing economic crisis threatens to cause a serious rise in unemployment levels .
this may lead to an increase in the problem of street children .
it is playing with fire to behave like this in times of such uncertainty .
sv madam president , many , like me , are concerned about the growing anti semitism in europe .
it was no ordinary match .
i would like to remind those who have forgotten that the tibetan uprising began on 10 march .
they are important subjects .
perhaps it isworld type approval for heavy goods vehicles dayortype approval inspectors day.
as we approach the european elections , I think that we should not raise such issues .
time is of the essence and I therefore hope that a framework mediation agreement will be drawn up shortly .
it is clear that short term aid must be provided to the farmers to help them survive .
bg thank you , madam president .
international women's day is an occasion for us to take stock of our gender equality policy .
in 2007 the european parliament adopted the report on the role of sport in education .
if we think back to 30 years ago , there is much to be concerned about .
hu I have spoken up several times on behalf of the traditional national minorities .
it is unacceptable for the state to interfere detrimentally in the life of a church .
bg thank you , madam president .
this would be a violation of basic cultural and national conventions for any civilised country .
it is intolerable and very serious .
pl madam president , today I do not want to raise a question of a political nature .
from a technical point of view , the matter is very simple .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports 
the european parliament expects the draft 2010 budget to help member states and citizens overcome the current crisis .
we ask the european commission to take our requests seriously .
i ask that you debate the proposals and then support them with your votes .
we must exclude matters unconnected with our mission from the budget as much as possible .
there are numerous examples .
neither do we need to have guards physically present in some places , especially in strasbourg and luxembourg .
we can achieve further savings running into millions if we improve cooperation between the institutions .
in various cases previously institutions have purchased or leased property at prices above the market rate .
thank you .
firstly , the emphasis on lawmaking .
in 2010 , foreign policy will , as in previous years , be a tricky issue .
i hope so .
we should remember that solidarity is most important during hard times .
it is like using the cavalry to attack a modern , mechanised army with guided missiles .
in these areas , too , the eu's budget is thoroughly negligible .
the same applies to energy policy .
what is lacking is consensus , and also dialogue .
as mr surján said , the available budget is tight 1 % of gross national product .
this concerns energy supply and energy security .
we should not be throwing more money at those who are earning enough as it is .
if we do support companies , why nabucco ?
why do we want to favour a hungarian company over an italian one , for example ?
what is your justification for this ?
in the face of the crisis , our european citizens want us to provide solution mechanisms .
they expect us to provide assistance .
the european union , with its scant resources , absolutely cannot afford this .
there are also some small matters in this house .
we have a great deal more work ahead of us in this regard .
the russian ukrainian gas crisis has pointed to europe's dependency in terms of gas supply .
this budget points beyond itself .
today there is something else at stake .
thanks to their amendment proposal the entire draft is of a higher quality .
i would like once again to thank all of my colleagues .
i look forward to our continuing cooperation .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 10 march 200written statements rule 142 
particular attention must be given to north south networks .
the next item is the joint debate on 
i wish to say a few words about the background .
this offer of a separate company form is particularly directed at europe's small and medium sized enterprises .
the story is similar to that of the european company .
my sincere thanks for your attention .
we also believe , therefore , that honest entrepreneurs who suffer business failure deserve a second chance .
we are grateful for your support .
there are those who consider such a cross border requirement essential for a european company forum .
all of these make a helpful contribution which will facilitate the application of this statute .
the commission , therefore , welcomes the adoption of this report .
however , we are not convinced that proposing new legislation now is the best solution to achieve this objective .
court of justice case law clearly allows for company mobility .
the cross border mergers directive was due to be transposed by member states by december 200it is too early to assess its full application .
on no account must existing rights be curtailed .
employeesrights are core rights for a social europe .
my call for labour law to provide a reliable basis for smes has also been incorporated .
impact assessments are to be carried out systematically in the case of new laws .
before their adoption , all eu provisions must be examined in terms of their impact on smes .
we must act quickly to take advantage of this potential .
we need to act quickly on this .
these initiatives were appreciated but inadequate .
he should take seriously the fact that parliament really wants him to present this proposal .
we now ask for it to be done immediately afterwards .
we found a very good compromise with the rapporteur .
i will take two examples .
that is included in point 87 regarding the cohesion fund .
second example red tape .
unfortunately , it is totally different now that it has arrived , accompanied by the european private company .
this has been the task of the committee on legal affairs .
i should like to congratulate mrs herczog on this report .
i congratulate you , therefore what are needed now are tax cuts for labour intensive sectors .
madam president , I too would like to welcome this report .
also , the cutting of red tape and bureaucracy by the commission has to be welcomed .
that amounts to savings for the european union of about eur 2.3 million .
there are major differences between member states in this regard .
we cannot allow social standards to slip .
we assert that they are essential to the health of the european economy .
the 23 million european smes cannot be subject to the same requirements as the 41 000 large undertakings .
if ever small businesses needed something , it is the reduction of administrative burdens .
however , I have two reservations .
secondly , I have personal doubts about the merits and benefits of changing the late payment directive .
otherwise , the majority of the good recommendations made herein will remain a dead letter .
mentorship is particularly important in encouraging such activities .
i would just like to comment on one point .
the vote will take place tomorrow , tuesday , at 12 noon .
his absence is due to preparations for that .
i wish to respond to some of the points raised .
this will also help facilitate subsidies for the production of green products .
mr karas spoke on the small business act sba .
we will therefore know more , and this culture of mainstreaming and support will grow .
follow up measures will be considered when the full assessment is completed in 20some points were made on why there was not more input into taxation and accounting .
i see many friends of smes here .
we therefore need to strike the right balance between freedom of establishment and the interests of third parties .
europe could be more innovative and creative in supporting smes .
we are talking here about reducing bureaucracy and trying to make things easier for smes .
my second point concerns participation .
it is practically only abuses that are being recorded .
last year , the largest member state , germany , abandoned this theory .
thank you very much for your support .
the vote will take place on thursday .
i would just like to highlight two absolutely essential aspects .
in most cases , the owner is a man , while any women are regarded as unpaid family workers .
smes account for more than 90 % of the eu economy and two thirds of its jobs .
the truth is specific .
this ensures that the workers get some insight into the position and future of the enterprise .
perhaps the commission's proposal will be improved slightly in the forthcoming negotiations .
perhaps the text that is finally adopted will not be so bad .
we must ensure that international conventions are correctly applied , as well as cooperation agreements with third countries .
agreements cannot be made with countries that have not signed the geneva convention .
asylum is not a concession asylum is a duty for states and a right for those fleeing war .
it shares our ambition to build a more protective , more effective and more just european asylum system .
the proposed amendments to the directive on reception conditions should provide an answer to these problems .
we must also arrive at a better definition of responsibilities in the case of people rescued at sea .
where should they disembark ?
naturally , one has to be aware of the pressures the asylum systems are under in some member states .
these eur 10 million will be used relocate more refugees in the union in 200i would really like to thank parliament for its support .
it is indeed my intention to include this in the stockholm programme .
in 2007 , the eu received more than 200 000 asylum applications .
finally , for us it is vital that we reform the dublin ii system .
this development is worrying , to say the least .
we already have international conventions that specify this .
almost every week we hear horrific reports from refugee camps in southern europe .
i fully share the view that it is unfortunate that entry into force has been postponed until 20what nevertheless still concerns me is the fact that children can be taken into custody .
for what crimes other than people trafficking is cooperation a requirement for asylum ?
the third issue is how different countries receive asylum seekers and which countries are chosen .
all this is a recipe for chaos and gridlock in national asylum systems .
but the easier we make it for them to come to europe , the more will come .
the harmonisation of standards is definitely worthy of support .
we have a duty and , as martine roure said , a moral imperative to do so .
i would like to give some clarifications .
i am thinking in particular of mr busuttil , who mentioned the difficult situation malta faces in this matter .
finally , and to close , some members have raised the question of border controls .
the debate is closed .
in recent months , the necessity to take action has not waned but has instead become even more urgent .
force can only be eliminated by striking at its roots .
this concerns not only central and eastern european countries , who long for peace , but every european citizen .
thank you for your patience .
that concludes this item .
the vote will take place on wednesday .
representative organisations and roma communities must play an active role in drawing up inclusion policies .
the opportunities for mobility have had the totally opposite effect for them , making discrimination worse .
the unusual reactions which we have seen in italy are a warning .
nevertheless , the eca has not been able to give the commission a positive statement of assurance for years .
it concludes that considerable progress has been achieved during the term of the current commission .
this is helping to reduce the administrative burden and allowing better use to be made of control results .
this concept aims to define at the policy level the acceptable balance between the control results and their costs .
our last report shows you that the commission has completed the various actions .
i thank mrs stauner for her report , which is a call to improve our accounting framework still further .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
in the current economic situation we cannot allow any wasteful spending or misuse of european funds .
integrity of online gambling short presentation 
however , not all gambling is the same .
3. cooperation between member states should be strengthened significantly 
5. we need more research in the area and finally
it was voted through with 32 votes in favour and 10 against .
written statements rule 142 
it is necessary to start from the fact that most european states have a gambling industry .
the commission welcomes the support for its policy of simplification toward trading standards .
therefore , mrs petre , you spur us on and encourage us to continue our work .
the procedures should be simplified or , at least , speeded up .
the question of an agency remains open .
in the meantime , the advantages and disadvantages of such a body need to be studied with care .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
written statements rule 142 
thus , food quality schemes do not only provide consumers authentic products but can also support rural development .
eu standards for placing food on the market are already among the toughest in the world .
eu food is distinguished by its high quality and correspondingly high standards .
the ideal solution would be to use physical means .
i think the task is quite a difficult one .
such was the regulation .
what does it say ?
progress has also been noted in the speed with which requests for the taking of evidence are handled .
however , it is imperative that its operation be improved .
as for the use of videoconferencing , that too will be made a priority .
we hope to take advantage of the new financing methods during the revision of the 2010 2013 financial perspective .
in any event , thank you for this helpful report which has been most enlightening .
that concludes this item .
the report calls on the commission to take steps quickly to correct these deficiencies .
the economic crisis has taught us that strict auditing and oversight are indispensible .
a dashboard is regularly published on our website .
i thank parliament for its support for these two initiatives .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
facing oil challenges short presentation 
how can we lower our consumption or cover it with other energy sources too ?
we also need to think about how to exploit all the available reserves as efficiently as possible .
that was a brief summary of the substance of this report .
the commission gives a favourable welcome to most of the points raised in mr reul's report .
the item is closed .
the vote will take place on wednesday .
oil is an outdated source .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
i fully support the commission conclusion that european energy markets are not functioning properly .
consumers are frequently misled by deliberately confusing online offers and advertisement despite european legislation that seeks to prevent this .
agenda for next sitting see minutes
the sitting was closed at 10.55 p.m. 
closure of the session
i declare the 2008 2009 session of the european parliament closed .
we were then debating an assessment of the area of freedom , security and justice .
this measure will lead to a significant improvement in the safety of european roads , especially of our motorways .
all I can say is that this could reduce the numbers of deaths and injuries by around 35 000 .
what we are aiming to adopt today represents a milestone when it comes to improving road safety .
this regulation will make european cars safer .
allow me to begin with the aspect of safety , which was the most important element in this project .
the costs to manufacturers will be far outweighed by the overall economic benefit .
that is , therefore , a really very noteworthy contribution .
i am very pleased that that is exactly how the european parliament sees it .
not every issue was covered , but that is the way with compromises .
the introduction of mandatory safety systems for vehicles is something I particularly welcome .
this must also unconditionally apply to tyre safety .
lane departure warning systems and electronic stability control are also important .
as regards lorries , 90 % of tyres already meet the noise levels contained in the compromise .
overall , we have achieved a good compromise .
it is one area above all where regulation has a definite role to play .
this differs from the commission proposal the economic crisis was misused to submit an atrocious proposal .
indeed , everyone complains that it lacks substance , and yet it is evidently being accepted .
in particular , I would like to emphasise once again what mrs rühle said .
that is why it is so important that this is now quickly rectified .
one part of these additional measures has now been regulated .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
written statements rule 142 
we are therefore helping a competitive car industry .
in order to obtain a permit , they must be better than the specification from the safety network .
there will be absolutely no need for stretchable derogations that are open to interpretation .
that and I will put this somewhat carefully is an exaggeration .
some member states have been simply overlooking the need to invest in modernising their plants for years .
the same applies to inspections by the authorities .
farmers have many more items on their wish lists , and the decision about these two points is appropriate .
i can understand that members of the ppe de group might not be completely satisfied with the various compromises .
i would also like to thank the committee on legal affairs for its positive contribution .
furthermore , it is distorting competition between european industries .
we must support the approval procedure and the institution of the bref in general .
this will make a further contribution towards improving environmental protection and the viability of european industry .
i therefore await your views on this important proposal and the constructive dialogue that will follow with interest .
greater effort is also required from the european commission , however .
therefore , I very much support the rapporteur's idea of setting a minimum standard .
personally , I am prepared to see a trade off .
that is exactly where we have to go .
this also strengthens our suppliers of green technology in europe .
you have negotiated all these compromises with us in a good way .
i myself worked on the soil protection directive .
to conclude , I welcome the limitation and inclusion of provisions on incinerators .
i think that in this light we should consolidate this debate with a house vote .
sometimes , it seems that this is the only environmental problem .
al gore has left a clear mark .
recent case law has shown this not to be the case .
for this reason , we want to remove these options for further extension of the derogations .
that amendment will save money at a critical time for health budgets .
people have enough to blame the eu for without that !
secondly , the minimum requirements for large combustion plants present significant problems for parts of the uk power sector .
finally , I am greatly concerned by and opposed to the european safety net .
i would ask all members to consider these points carefully before voting .
after such a period , the techniques have moved on far ahead of us .
i find the hysteria when we deal with soil protection or the wishes of the farmersunions incomprehensible .
the socialist group in the european parliament wants to achieve environmental targets without impeding economic activities .
this is disproportionate and therefore not sensible .
i would like to thank mrs jackson for her proposal for an amendment .
mr president , I will stick specifically to agriculture .
we have heard many times in this chamber the question of food security .
i am going to ask you a simple question , and please try to answer it today .
it is an instrument for solving problems and one that we should give a chance to .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 10 march 200written statements rule 142 
this is a subject that touches upon fundamental and sometimes conflicting rights of citizens , associations and undertakings .
parliament , council and commission are much more open now than ever before .
having said this , even a good tool can always be improved .
the use of the recast technique meets the objective of better lawmaking .
unfortunately , the european union can hardly brag about its transparency .
i cannot understand how european union citizens can be outsiders .
we want increased transparency and citizens must be able to follow the democratic debate .
as regards sanctions , there is already existing legislation to be taken into account .
the agenda specified two minutes , but I am sure that you will have a further opportunity to speak .
we are speaking now about privacy in the era of the internet and not privacy as an abstract notion .
transparency and public access create a sense of participation and confidence in the political system .
commissioner wallström said that a good tool can always be improved .
we fight for data protection for our citizens , yet meps are to be expected to make everything public .
when we vote , everyone can look up how individual meps have voted .
all meps must also bear responsibility for the way they vote .
this is already in evidence as things stand .
we will clarify the final position of our group tonight .
the principles of democracy demand it .
i believe it is time that more attention was finally paid to this state of affairs .
i am therefore sorry that the commission gave no consideration to the rapporteur's 2006 proposal on transparency .
i rest my case .
the european parliament is being classed as the outside world , to which information is not provided .
this will also be a version for the age of the internet , as was mentioned in the debate .
is this post it note a document , for example ?
another fiercely discussed point is article 5 2 concerning access to member statesdocuments .
finally , I shall just comment on thespace to thinkunder article 4 3 .
i want rights enshrined in law which cannot be taken away not gifts , but rights .
written statements rule 142 
cooperation between the courts of the member states in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters
equal treatment and access for men and women in the performing arts 
i am also quite surprised !
at this time , we are still getting used to the recast rules .
you all have a note to that effect in the voting list .
this parliament has no right to introduce legislation .
its chance of influence is in amending legislation put before us .
it seems that , in the way we have interpreted the recast procedures , we have castrated ourselves .
after the vote 
this is enough .
the oral amendment was incorporated in the first of the four votes .
that is correct .
no .
i asked if there were any objections to the oral amendment .
before the vote on paragraph 31 
mr president , that will be very simple .
integrity of online gambling 
commission reports on competition policy 2006 and 2007 
small business act 
before the vote on paragraph 8 
voting time
on behalf of the alde group . mr president , I seek clarification .
the president is considering these two points .
de mr president , I congratulate the house on this new information system .
oral explanations of vote
it is for that reason that I voted against the report .
i have an additional point .
we have concerns in ireland about road safety issues .
better safety and more environmentally sensitive and sensible proposals are always welcome .
in that way , we can together establish a high standard at the european level .
regulations on soil protection have no cross border effect .
i therefore continue to believe that the member states can regulate soil protection themselves .
it must be rejected .
i cannot accept that .
perhaps a word of explanation is necessary concerning the correct actions of the president of the parliament .
that is very confusing for people who have to deal with this legislation .
i recently met with some producers in my constituency .
i give the example of the european fundamental rights agency , which is currently under investigation by olaf .
nl mr president , I voted against this report .
there is no doubt that integrity in the online gaming sector is extremely important .
however , this does not mean that we must turn to protectionism .
therefore , we must sayyesto integrity andnoto protectionism .
so I asked my pensioners .
these are not issues that the european parliament can underestimate .
this debate showed up many national differences , and there was no honesty in the debate at all .
there was one reasonable part , which was the part about fair return to guarantee integrity in sport .
mr president , we all know that gambling is a very emotive subject .
mr president , quality food is not an aspiration in europe it must continue as a reality .
mr president , thank you for giving me this opportunity to explain how I voted .
this is what it seems to have come down to .
we have 23 million smes in the european union .
they represent up to 99 % of all firms and provide work to more than 100 million eu citizens .
the fact that smes are usually considered more risky makes it difficult for them to get access to finance .
99.2 % of my region's businesses employ fewer than 49 people .
this initiative can curb unemployment and restart our economy .
it is really about big business , not about small businesses , and we should reflect that .
i should explain that being in a big group is not everything it seems .
it is that sort of attitude that we need to tackle .
written explanations of vote
i support mrs hennis plasschaert's report on the next steps in border management in the european union .
this view is shared by the european data protection supervisor .
the commission must manage the interconnection of these systems and expand their functionality in order to streamline costs .
creating the electronic system of travel authorisation is not justified financially .
we must also take into consideration the experience in the us in this area .
mr president , I supported giusto catani's report .
this is a joint responsibility .
i support mr catania's report on the future of the european common asylum system .
legends die hard .
thank you , mr president , I voted in favour of the report .
even the world of performing arts , as clearly highlighted by the commission , is not spared these problems .
we have therefore voted in favour of this report .
in writing . I believe that gender inequality should be phased out of our lives .
the european parliament must observe its past legislation and uphold the values of universal solidarity .
there is also the fact that working hours in the performing arts are long and non standard .
green drivingmeans reducing fuel consumption .
it was therefore decided to recast these directives and we have voted on them in parliament today .
minimum requirements .
resources would be better spent enforcing the directive in those member states which are non compliant .
poultry and manure and slurry .
on poultry , the ippc already controls 40 000 poultry places .
instalments .
i also voted in favour of flexibility for instalments
as the report states , this legislative process could have implications for 52 000 industrial plants in europe .
i therefore warmly support the commission's initiative and the rapporteur's suggestion .
the pronouncements by the european commission about limiting emissions of greenhouse gases are misleading and disorientating .
although the compromise is far better than the original proposal , we have not succeeded fully .
this afternoon , we voted on the statute for a european private company .
in the end , I voted against the proposal , for the following reasons .
no satisfactory answers are provided to such questions .
the basic idea of introducing a common european company form for private companies is a very good one .
however , it is not that proposal that we are to adopt a position on today .
i have therefore chosen to vote against it .
the process is not yet over .
the stipulation that a european private company really is active across borders .
at a time of a raging economic crisis , developing the sme sector is a highly desirable thing .
we have therefore chosen to vote against this report on the commission's budget for 20in this way , the real motivations prompting the european institutions to act are lost sight of .
in fact , perhaps they are the ones that are most in need of community institutional support .
experience shows that such a museum will be designed as propaganda for an increasingly federal eu .
central to the report is the safeguarding of the integrity of sports and sporting events .
in writing . I support a more open gaming environment in europe .
online gambling offers a new way for consumers to enjoy their gaming experience .
we must ensure that these people are safe from harm on line .
these systems should not be made uniform or merged into one .
allow me to congratulate my colleague , mrs petre , for this excellent report .
contrary to the claims made , production of real quality is at serious risk of disappearing .
applying harmonised production and marketing standards to both small producers and agro industry is unacceptable .
that way , regulation and quality control for agricultural products will become easier .
can anything that is not healthy to humans be described asfood?
in addition , the union must ensure a level playing field between locally produced and third country products .
in particular , they failed to evaluate the abuses of purchasing power which may follow from such concentration .
this report has finally found a route to agree between ourselves in the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
ms herczog's report recognises the work done by the commission and calls for further steps in this direction .
these elements make it impossible for ukip to support this proposal .
the global financial crisis and slow economic growth are having a negative impact on the level of entrepreneurship .
this fosters obvious inequalities in terms of competitiveness .
this would put european smes on a par with their counterparts in the rest of the world .
this is neoliberalism in its most visible form .
however , I have some comments to make .
support for smes must be a top priority , particularly in this period of serious economic crisis .
if the big companies fold , the little ones will inevitably follow .
these are decisive , especially when they have to pay back loans at a time of economic stagnation .
i can tell you right now that most of my concerns have been dispelled .
this advance was due to mr costa's efforts until the very last second .
this change has enabled us to reach a solution , albeit a minimal one .
this measure targets hulks .
parliament played its part back then .
the ais is also there for the benefit of fishing vessels , improving safety for these vessels , too .
we have also tightened up the arrangement for the accommodation of ships in distress .
the establishment of these rules was absolutely not an end in itself .
other regulations among the topics recently discussed in the european parliament unify the minimum requirements for crew training .
this includes the establishment of fixed deadlines for commencing and completing investigations and a structure for the final reports .
unfortunately , the incidents that set the process in motion made it clear .
this ensures that the whole sector and the whole framework of maritime safety have today taken a step forward .
after all , my colleagues and I have had the honour and the opportunity to tackle more specific problems .
however , the reality of the situation , so to speak , required that the scope be partially reduced .
we set , however , a rather long period to ensure that voyages in domestic waters are also covered .
it is better , however , that they are there , rather than not having changed anything .
i would like to thank mr tajani and the commission .
at the time of first reading , parliament adopted some amendments .
at that time , we reached political agreements on six of the eight proposals .
it is important to highlight the ratification of international conventions using the national method in this process .
they are capable of sending out a message to defend the rights of passengers .
they are capable of sending out a message to protect companies and ensure the rules are respected .
that is something we should say in the election campaign , too .
let me make two more points , however .
we should be fighting together to achieve that .
mr president , I have just had a real race to get to the chamber .
this was not heeded .
how democratic is that ?
whatever happened to the comments made here this very morning that this is an amending house ?
i am pleased at that . however , this parliament's term is coming to an end .
there is already a great deal of experience with this in aviation .
the rapporteur has done an excellent job in this regard .
what we have now is more transparency and stricter inspections .
the president cut off the speaker 
for me , the significance of this package will be felt for many years to come .
will the agency be able to cooperate effectively with the commission in ensuring the enforcement of these rules ?
that will ensure that the decisions made are rigorous , right and fair .
if we can do that , we will have helped to safeguard our maritime heritage .
we shall keep an eye on you , and shall support you again if further proposals are needed .
we could say much more , but there would not be much point .
i also think it would be good for the commission to report to parliament on this subject in 20i also thank everyone for your comments and contributions .
the debate is closed .
furthermore , no one can say what rescue operations were carried out after the emergency signal was received .
the investigation into the reasons and consequences of this accident has reached a dead end at the moment .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports 
this should bring us one step closer to a more sustainable transport system .
such revenue must be reinvested in the transport system with the aim of keeping external costs down .
fourthly , there must be the possibility of further action in future .
you know , it is the same story with the eurovignette .
mr vice president , congestion is caused by an insufficient provision of infrastructure by the member states .
no , you are the commission !
hence my puzzlement .
we will , of course , be pleased to hear your suggestions on this matter .
the costs incurred by traffic congestion are rising to 1 % of gdp .
the internal market is important , and so it is also important that agreements be made between member states .
the government has created a dense network of ever wider motorways .
many goods are now transported over long distances , sometimes even at various stages of the production process .
this encourages even more transport and increases the environmental impact still further .
decisions taken on this in 2006 have yielded insufficient results .
this is essential to my support for the eurovignette directive .
in addition , this proposal must not remain isolated .
the member states , as the shapers of their own specific conditions , must also have their place .
design should take precedence here , not bans .
there are a number of points that need to be made in this debate .
however , as a first stage , I think that this compromise deserves support .
this report is a serious attempt to deliver what parliament has called for over many years .
we should not forget the reason why this process has dragged on for so long .
at least three factors are simultaneously at play .
ga mr president , I would like to say that I understand the reasons behind this report .
the commissioner said that mountain regions are opposing the single market .
they are hit while going to the market .
everyone essentially agrees to the principle of paying the true costs .
he has achieved a workable compromise under really difficult conditions .
however , there is still one fly in the ointment , as I see it .
i hope that we will receive the necessary majority to achieve that breakthrough .
it is particularly important that we do not lose sight of that fact certainly not at this time .
transport has always been the lifeblood of the whole economy .
that is unfair competition .
that is why we need this directive .
then they will be credible .
we are also impugning other measures taken to promote the economic , social and territorial cohesion of the union .
it should not be for the eu to dictate aone size fits allapproach in this area .
pl mr. president , I would like to thank our rapporteur , mr el khadraoui .
he has dealt with hundreds of comments .
the hauliers have cited huge financial burdens , particularly those of tax on fuels .
i believe that both the european commission and governments should enter into dialogue with professional road hauliers .
we need to achieve cost reality here to really bring about a situation where market economic instruments regulate traffic .
otherwise , we will always have imbalances in this regard .
if peripheral regions decide not to take that route , that is something I can understand .
i should mention that specific legislative instruments such as these are actually necessary in member states such as romania .
this directive , however , has absolutely nothing to do with that .
all this discussion therefore highlights the difficulty of the issue , but also its importance .
the argument is therefore certainly thorny and complicated .
noise would add 1.1 euro cents to this .
let us simply go for a position we support 100 % .
my group is in favour of the internalisation of external costs , and specifically exhaust emissions and noise .
we believe this is reasonable .
that is not on .
thank you very much .
question time commission 
the next item is question time b6 0009 / 2009 which , exceptionally , will last until 8 p.m.
the following questions have been submitted to the commission .
a sustainable energy financing initiative is being developed jointly by the commission and the european investment bank .
i also think that a fund for energy efficiency and renewable energy would be important .
the ecofin today came to a compromise .
subject more flexible interpretation of the stability and growth pact
de mr president , commissioner , I have two brief questions .
my second question is as follows .
should this question not be linked to a certain level of success ?
i thought it was the questioner who had a supplementary , plus two other members .
secondly , what time does question time continue until tonight as we started late ?
we began late and we will finish late .
the commissioner must know a little bit about tax havens , because luxembourg rather falls into that category .
these are her words a resolute policy against tax evasion.
subject the internet and hate crimes
this includes prohibition of incitement to hatred based on race , sex , religion or nationality.
this year , it will present a recommendation on media literacy .
i myself have tried , with the safer internet programme , to do something else in this respect .
now to the murder question which the honourable member underlined .
subject information and communication technologies ict and information society
the commission has also set up a consumer market scoreboard that permits monitoring of market outcomes for consumers .
the evidence on the scoreboard helps us to better take account of consumer interests .
you can see a lot of the work they do .
however , I want to ask you what you are doing to develop online services .
i am referring in this case to the public key infrastructure .
is the commission able to do anything about this ?
member of the commission . first of all , the internet and the elections .
has the commission raised this and , if so , what action is it taking ?
questions nos 37 and 40 will receive answers in writing .
i would like to thank the commissioner for her reply .
i could have printed that off from the internet myself .
therefore , as I have said , let us not speculate on hypothetical situations in the future .
de mr president , I would like to support mrs ludford's question .
what he has not said , is whether or not serbia fulfils this criterion .
does serbia fulfil the criterion of full cooperation ?
subject opening of theenergychapter in the accession negotiations with turkey
initiating negotiations in the energy sector would make a decisive contribution to attaining this objective .
thank you for giving me the opportunity to answer them together .
i do not underestimate the difficulties in the dairy sector .
i think it is decades since we experienced a situation like the one we are seeing today .
farmers cannot continue to produce milk under the current conditions .
and yet time is the one thing we do not have .
i also sometimes have to remind some farmers that this compensation has already taken place .
as a result , there are many different labelling techniques in operation within the eu for sheep products .
it is important .
i am happy with all the comments that we have already had on the green paper .
would the commission consider granting a further deferral or removing the compulsory nature of this proposal ?
that concludes question time .
the sitting was suspended at 8.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. 
childcare facilities barcelona objectives debate 
the next item is the commission statement on childcare facilities barcelona objectives .
the aim is to offer this option to parents who want it .
a lot of work remains to be done , especially concerning children under three years old .
it encourages the member states to make full use of the possibilities offered by the structural funds .
on behalf of the ppe de group . commissioner , thank you for your statement .
in this way , we can also ensure well prepared and competent labour forces .
for citizens throughout europe , the subject of children is right at the top of their priorities .
in parliament , the subject of children is spread across all the committees .
thank you ever so much .
we need to press the reset button when it comes to matters of integration and start again from scratch .
yet , commissioner špidla , you have said that there are funding opportunities .
i have , I am afraid to say , heard no answer from you today on that question .
what else will the commission do to encourage the member states ?
you have also hinted that there are possibilities of co financing .
i would ask that you answer this question .
the care a child receives in the earliest years will have an impact on him or her throughout life .
women have been a wonderful addition to the workforce .
children are our future .
for better or for worse , we are shaping europe's future by how we raise our children .
i would ask the commission to view this issue for a moment from a child's point of view .
the situation with childcare in slovakia is rather complicated .
yet women have the same right as men to professional fulfilment .
how , then , can we talk about making it easy for women to return to work ?
however , we must look at the services being supplied , because quality costs money .
in addition , the number of single parent families is on the rise .
in some countries , almost a third of children are not born in the traditional family set up .
many of them live in poor families without any proper provision for food , healthcare and education .
it is the question of which social model we wish to promote .
i would like to ask you to read a bit of european history as well .
in this case , I recommend the following actions 
1. increase the involvement of national governments in this problem ,
many have spoken about the economic crisis .
this is not a time to dismiss childcare but to increase quality , affordable childcare for all .
we need , like never before , to invest in our children .
childcare helps families and society as a whole , and it can help the most vulnerable children too .
things have gradually improved , with the adoption of qualitative methodologies resulting from care staff receiving specialist training .
they have inferiority complexes in relation to those children who have grown up in a normal family .
it all sounds so logical and modern , socialist , even .
in this area , there is no progress or revolutionary change .
nobody wants to send women into the home .
in the new perspective , it is explicitly possible for the first time .
the present recession proves that disturbances in the financial market have noticeable negative side effects on the real economy .
children of immigrants debate 
member states must reinforce preventative measures and focus on the most vulnerable families .
we know that the parents of children from member states working in any other country receive child benefit .
i think that raising awareness among the parents who come to our countries to work is also our affair .
if one part of the body hurts , the whole body hurts .
an impact assessment is an urgent and necessary requirement .
i believe that this situation could be improved through adopting the following measures 
these services should be accessible to every migrant worker segment .
ro I would like to highlight one thing .
i was recently the shadow for the ppe de group on the report on educating the children of migrants .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on thursday , 12 march 200although circumstances vary between individual member states , the employment situation in europe is generally deteriorating .
the level of unemployment in the eu could be around 10 % in 20i have to say that neither qimonda management nor employee representatives have approached the commission .
it is a company that uses cutting edge technology , employs highly qualified workers and promotes research .
the portuguese government has already decided to make eur 100 million available for this purpose .
qimonda is not just any company !
during the last year , it received eur 325 million in subsidies , which proved to be inadequate .
the commissioner was right .
there is not much time left , just a few days .
top management figures are already drifting away .
that cannot , I would contend , be in the interests of the european union .
the portuguese government has been doing everything that it considers appropriate and useful to help resolve the situation .
saving the plants in munich will have a decisive impact on those in vila do conde and dresden .
time is short !
mr president , I commend the priority given to this debate .
the ball is firmly in national governmentscourts to apply for this funding .
furthermore , the derogations to minimum size are adjusted .
in the mediterranean , the artisanal coastal fishery now benefits from a derogation .
i think they will be successful .
if we want to save this species , we have to learn more about it .
mr president , the time has come to speak clearly .
i am not talking about a decade here , but five years at most .
this is particularly common in the mediterranean as recent journalistic investigations have revealed in the tv and press .
this time scale is very tight and I fear that there will be problems .
when issuing the new regulations , iccat must take into account this diversity of fishing systems .
not respecting the new recovery plan will have serious consequences and will lead to a collapse of the stock .
if not , however , then next year we will have to speak another language .
the vote will take place on thursday , 12 march 2009 at 12 noon .
agenda for next sitting see minutes
closure of the sitting
opening of the sitting
this barbaric act of terrorism has once again torn a family apart and brought with it unimaginable suffering .
these acts of terrorism shock us all .
terrorism represents one of the greatest dangers to the security , stability and democratic values of the international community .
the european parliament plays an active role in combating terrorism and in supporting the victims of terrorist attacks .
we would like to express our solidarity with them .
applause 
i know that there are some celebrations in madrid today , but little else .
however , the purpose of today's meeting is to discuss the upcoming european council .
we also need to do more to improve the regulation and supervision of financial institutions .
two thirds of european banksassets are held in only 44 multinational groups .
as you are well aware , member statesbudget deficits are growing fast right now .
of course , deficits inevitably swell in times of economic recession .
automatic stabilisers can , to some extent , play a positive role .
the european council will assess the state of implementation of this programme .
this issue will also be the focus of the special summit which will take place in early may .
let me be clear on one point we will not protect jobs by creating barriers to foreign competition .
we cannot afford it to fail .
the commission has provided some very useful elements in its second strategic energy review .
it means taking adequate measures to improve energy efficiency .
we must create a fully fledged internal market for electricity and gas .
next week's meeting will also discuss the preparations for the copenhagen conference on climate change .
the partnership includes a bilateral dimension which is adapted to each partner country .
the multilateral track will provide a framework in which common challenges can be addressed .
you will appreciate from this presentation that next week's european council has many substantial issues to address .
mr president , mr vondra , honourable members , we are living through testing times .
it destroys jobs and tests the resistance of our social models .
it also puts strong political pressure on all the leaders .
now is the time to move up a gear in our response to the crisis .
i am proud to note that the commission's preparatory work has met with such a favourable reception .
yes , we need immediate action to address immediate problems .
that is why we have set out a detailed calendar of new regulatory proposals .
just look at energy security .
this is central to what we are doing .
the money has to come , essentially , from national budgets .
the single market is the best possible platform for recovery .
this requires determination and imagination .
we will also carry more weight on the global stage .
they are based around the same principles .
europe today has to find its strength in cohesion , in coordination , in real practical solidarity .
bankruptcies are still occurring and unemployment is continuing to rise .
the european project is a political project , and a guarantor of peace , freedom and democracy .
we have been , and are currently , in a financial crisis that has turned into an economic crisis .
now the employment crisis is coming crashing in , with the prospect of social problems further down the road .
we have talked about lifelong learning .
now we come to the social consequences .
we must create opportunities for young people to find employment or further education or whatever it may be .
thank you , mr president , mr vondra and mr barroso .
the analysis of the mistakes made and experience gained must continue .
i will end by mentioning again that we need to see solidarity in action .
therefore , in the short term , we need to keep people in work .
it must not be a routine summit .
it is really wonderful and it all sounds excellent .
more must be done in the european council .
this means that companies are being threatened with closure .
three member states have implemented the resolution so far , which means that 24 states have not .
you must do more !
it is important for the commission to urge the member states to show solidarity .
amendment 92 will be the litmus test for you when we vote on it at midday .
let us see if you vote in favour of amendment 102 , in which we are demanding solidarity .
one final remark which is of crucial importance for our group relates to amendment 113 concerning tax havens .
this is a class war from above , which we at least do not want to be part of .
applause 
and their underlying message is this jobs , jobs , jobs .
nor should we accept heel dragging over the need to protect the planet .
so recession must not mean inaction .
the time has come for the fundamental reform that will provide jobs now and security in the future .
my view of this is slightly different to that of my fellow members .
we will not emerge from this crisis and there will be no real recovery .
the discussion on the links between climate policy , sustainability strategies and crisis management is just as inconsistent .
these economic recovery plans will not equip the european economy to face the future .
europe must take a different route .
a major problem confronting member states , including the czech republic , is company relocations .
de mr president , ladies and gentlemen , sometimes I do not believe what I hear .
finally , I would like to mention a number of areas of common interest .
we should not discuss this until we are blue in the face .
the citizens of europe expect us to act jointly in this crisis and not to oppose one another .
please do not paint too rosy a picture of europe . 
when you talk about automatic stabilisers , it is already in the prognosis .
how could you imagine respect for the european union ?
let us now avoid new economic demarcation lines between the new ones and the old ones .
we therefore urgently need a boost from europe .
mr daul is quite correct .
now is the time for us to show solidarity and innovation .
we therefore need innovation in two areas .
first , we should not squander these eur 5 billion on state aid .
we are therefore losing the battle when it comes to the next big thing in the economy .
in addition , it was this policy which was responsible for the crisis that we find ourselves in today .
what we need is exactly the opposite .
the low pay sector in europe must be reduced in size rather than continually being fostered .
i believe that social justice is now the only sensible economic policy .
it is the only way of bringing this disastrous crisis to an end .
could we have a better delivery ?
we need to stabilise the financial markets and reduce the risk of similar crises for the future .
it is not enough to do a lot but it is necessary to do enough .
this is what people in the street are waiting for from us .
the opportunities for these member states to use financial and fiscal instruments are limited , or completely non existent .
the posting directive should reinforce workersrights and not help to weaken them .
this is exactly the opposite to what the commission and the council are proposing .
after all , economic growth and low inflation provided scope for reform .
reform was necessary in the competition with up and coming economies and is , indeed , still needed .
only in this way can we avoid the costs of this crisis getting out of hand .
temporary support measures that meet the sustainability test can therefore be applied on a limited scale .
mr president , this debate is about jobs , and jobs and new prosperity .
i appreciate we can agree on that point .
i appreciate the consensus in parliament that your policy was wrong .
that is the way we can achieve more jobs .
the objectives of the lisbon strategy should not be put on ice .
it is now or never for europe .
pl mr president , a true strategy for economic recovery is essential for the european union .
today , that predatory procedure runs to tens of millions of euros and is ruining new member states .
the framework system is thus a good tool , the creation of which is a joint european success .
it needs to provide the appropriate resources currently , however , the recovery plan is not enough .
the structural funds should be used more actively and more in keeping with the situation .
member states should focus their attention on enabling the beneficiaries to control the funds .
this is one measure for combating the economic crisis which we can support unconditionally .
we must support this report unreservedly .
madam president , these three very extremely important reports have been drafted by socialist rapporteurs .
the role of the eib must be strengthened .
economic operators need prospects and legal stability .
the text on rating agencies must implement the lessons learned from the proven shortcomings .
europe also needs to be given a proper , effective , modern industrial policy .
let us have a recovery plan with substance and with action , and not just words .
the task is therefore great , and we must not err or procrastinate .
this is an enormous sum , and to use it properly is a great challenge .
further steps are to be taken at the spring 2009 european council in this regard.
there is , once again , a perceived lack of solidarity and a high degree of timidity .
for europe , today , that would be the equivalent of eur 400 billion per year over several years .
we have established the internal market , which has brought us much prosperity , together .
parliament should also play a guard dog role when it comes to the strength of the euro .
this should be an exception , though .
what is the cost of borrowing they would have to pay ?
it will also amount to genuine implementation of a policy of solidarity , and not protectionism .
we are all aware of this .
will you vote in favour ?
firstly , of course , the socialists are not responsible for the crisis .
we all know whose fault it is and this has been investigated in great detail .
the group will vote in favour of this .
i therefore support the many calls this morning for greater responsibility and more intensive cooperation .
martin schulz said that the issue isjobs , jobs and jobs and he is right .
we intend to address that issue at next week's meeting .
graham watson asked how much we will have to pay .
i think that is premature .
however , it would be premature to give an estimate now .
i am sorry for once to have to contradict mr juncker .
we must take the appropriate political measures in this respect .
this really is not about dividends for shareholders or bonuses for managers .
this transformation must continue during the crisis .
this means that we must help them to obtain funding .
however , what is parliament asking of the council ?
the european union is about competition , but it is also about cohesion and solidarity .
we cannot have a single market without this guarantee of solidarity and cohesion .
we do , of course , have governments of the centre and of the right in europe .
it is now that we need to do this .
we cannot wait until the summit in may .
the employment issues must be top of the agenda right now .
thank you , madam president .
the vote will take place today , wednesday 11 march .
written statements rule 142 
all member states , including malta , had to set out their strategies to deliver growth in jobs .
employment guidelines were set out .
it is precisely now that they want to see what the united europe is for .
indeed , solidarity is an absolute must to get through this crisis .
i represent romania in the european parliament , a country in south eastern europe .
certain parts of europe must not feel abandoned and helpless against a hostile situation which they have not provoked .
i totally concur with this statement .
in addition , measures to combat the crisis must be integrated as part of a responsible budgetary policy .
but how this is done does matter to the utmost .
pro cyclicality has to be averted both during an upswing and a downswing .
just cutting budget deficits drastically would not help much in this regard either .
the main features common to european union member states are democracy , stability , accountability and cohesion .
we are living in a period of economic uncertainty .
i find some of the language in kirilov's report in relation to the lisbon strategy regrettable .
countries which help banks financially are not eliminating the causes of the crisis .
the economic crisis has now reached europe .
in addition , they must enshrine the fundamental principle of the eu , namely the principle of solidarity .
it is necessary to create incentives to attract capital investment .
on the contrary , openness and the spirit of competition need to remain the basis of our activities .
in other words , the crisis should be seen as an incentive to implement the lisbon strategy .
it is obvious that state aid must be used prudently to avoid creating problems with competition .
firstly , the funding for energy infrastructure projects .
the commission also gave its first assessment of the results of the european economic stimulus package .
i congratulate the rapporteur on a very creditable report .
the emergence of tendencies is very worrying .
a crisis is also an opportunity .
we need to improve coordination and to abandon protectionism and all forms of demagoguery .
it is important that the eu should make conditions more flexible .
the third important matter is the supervisory mechanism the present bureaucracy is clearly unwieldy .
thank you for the report .
regional policy is the primary source of european investment in the real economy .
these measures must be supported by legislative proposals which also guarantee the financial allocations .
in other words we produce documents which we do not then implement .
vat exemption on the final importation of certain goods 
common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations recast 
investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector 
the liability of carriers of passengers by sea in the event of accidents 
civil liability and financial guarantees of shipowners 
the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures 
the commission takes note of the amendments voted by parliament that it will study in detail .
the commission confirms its willingness to seek a compromise with parliament and council .
i therefore ask for the house's support for a referral back to committee .
i will pass on this request , then , mr cashman , and the results will be made known .
facing oil challenges 
greening of transport and internalisation of external costs 
on the other hand , there is a request for a separate roll call vote on the original text .
before the vote on paragraph 20 
i want to change the wordfortofrom.
this is not contentious .
employment policy guidelines vote 
this is normally built into an amendment , but for some reason it got left out .
there is an indent that was worded as follows intensify the elimination of barriers.
until a few minutes ago , things looked quite different .
it is to your credit that you have encouraged the spread of social democracy .
this is good for the european parliament , which has moved to the left .
fr madam president , did he speak on behalf of the commission ?
because he wants to become a commissioner ?
as far as I know , the final vote has not been taken on the reul report .
can you confirm if this correct ?
pl madam president , imposing additional charges on heavy goods vehicles represents an increase in taxation .
i do not endorse the directive in its present form because it requires radical revision .
it improved greatly at parliament's reading , when we consider what the commission's original proposal was .
transparency must apply at each administrative level with regard to documents .
madam president , I am grateful for this opportunity to explain how I voted on this very important report .
were we able to debate these in an open and transparent manner ?
it I would like to thank those fans who have been tirelessly listening for so long .
i believe that my country should withdraw from the eu's social chapter .
that is the best thing that we could do to create more jobs in the economy .
however , at least this saves our taxpayers some of the unnecessary waste .
equal rights and opportunities must be provided to all citizens of europe , including the roma .
how is it possible that in a united europe , there are cases like this ?
madam president , I abstained on this report because I believe it simply does not go far enough .
this is unfortunate because there are some good proposals .
much more could have been done for the aviation sector , however .
then we might achieve this objective perhaps by 2020 or 20this mainly means that there has to be europe wide commitment to training and research very soon .
you may not have noticed , but we have made very little progress so far .
we are here for only three or four days per month .
they travel and cause carbon emission while they are getting here .
we are the worst hypocrites when it comes to this than any chamber I know .
madam president , have you noticed that the harmonisation of policy always happens in the same direction ?
i was also in support of the wide ranging remit given in this report to address the current crisis .
this is the test of sincerity for barack obama , for president sarkozy and for the other leaders .
i do wonder though whether , in this house , we know what the real economy is .
or is the real economy actually people doing jobs of work and innovating and starting their own businesses ?
however , things have changed now , and the money is running out .
pactio olisipiensis censenda est !
written explanations of vote
madam president , I voted in favour .
i believe that the environmental disaster that struck romania cannot go unheeded .
romania has emerged from the flooding exhausted , not only economically and environmentally , but also in social terms .
nonetheless , I fully endorse this tangible evidence of european solidarity .
this gesture is the eu's response to the request for assistance made by romania .
the application relates to five counties maramureş , suceava , botoşani , iaşi and neamţ .
on the other hand , it discharges its obligations as a flag state , in accordance with international conventions .
eight legislative texts making up a maritime package have just been adopted in the european parliament .
substandard vessels sailing under flags of convenience are slashing transport prices .
i agree with the objectives of the 3rd maritime package .
for these reasons , we abstained in the final vote on this report .
i agree with the objectives of the 3rd maritime package .
i therefore support the rapporteur's recommendation to approve the draft recommendation agreed with the council .
the eurovignette report contradicts these aims in the case of the peripheral member states of the european union .
in the final vote , I voted against adoption of the directive .
we should certainly seek ways to enable the use of more environmentally friendly vehicles on our roads .
we should not , however , use methods which are , in fact , another way of taxing enterprises .
during this time of financial crisis , it is kind of absurd .
this type of regulation shows that the eu is turning its back on its citizens .
i believe it is counterproductive to penalise someone who is stuck in congestion .
this is good news for the taxpayer .
at the moment , we are all still paying for the damage caused by air pollution .
traffic jams are a major contributor to air pollution , noise pollution and fuel waste .
madam president , I voted for the report .
for this reason I argued strongly in the past for the publication of parliamentary attendance .
what can we see ?
accordingly , documents on trade negotiations are deemed confidential .
ultimately , this is a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea .
we must rise to the challenges associated with the rise in unemployment and social exclusion .
it is remarkable that this report should admit several failures by the european union on social issues .
for this reason , I have voted against the report .
i voted against mr andersson's report .
it is , above all , a crisis of confidence .
this is not enough , however .
the roma community is europe's largest and most disadvantaged minority group .
i support this report because it suggests ways in which we can improve the situation of the roma community .
the huge growth in demand beyond the eu's borders alone will determine this .
investment is only possible when there is sufficient capital and there is a hope of some profit .
as such , I have voted against this report .
in a nutshell , this is the most important part of the preamble to the resolution .
however , this fact does not mean that all its underlying concepts need to be revised .
however , unless it speaks with one voice , this will result in loss of credibility .
limiting global average temperature increases is necessary not only in the developed world , but also in developing countries .
the eu has to provide a plan which will address relevant areas and sources of financing .
on the other hand , I cannot support several paragraphs of the report .
in writing . we must use the green economy to create jobs throughout the eu .
in writing . sv this resolution contains many deserving exhortations .
members insist that all financial aid must be timely , targeted and temporary .
the bail out of the banks was a necessary but not sufficient step .
data from the last few weeks do not engender optimism .
this is why the effective and rapid restoration of the award of credit must be ensured urgently .
several observations are called for , however .
we have to be aware of this .
there is already talk of increased taxes in the near future to keep public finances afloat .
the same can be said for the european commission .
it is counterproductive simply to increase demand in order to bring production back on song .
in writing . the financial crisis is the first test of globalisation .
surely it cannot be the intention to take short term measures that undermine long term objectives ?
madam president , I voted for the report .
for this reason I argued strongly in the past for the publication of parliamentary attendance .
the latter will have to be confirmed as a priority of cohesion policy after 20as a result , not surprisingly , the majority of parliament rejected our proposals , which 
i voted against mr kirilov's report on cohesion policy investing in the real economy .

state of play of sis ii debate 
the problem is therefore not technical , but political .
a number of operational difficulties have led to specific problems in getting sis ii up and running .
the final results of these operational system tests were only known in the second half of january 200this parliament has asked whether the problems identified to date will require the system to be rebuilt .
in concrete terms , the commission is coordinating a joint management structure for the project .
the broad outlines of the approach recommended by the commission for the continuation of sis ii were accepted .
we are therefore able to continue this feasibility study into an alternative solution .
this report is to be produced as soon as possible , and by no later than may 200for clarity's sake , this means that we will have a council decision at the start of june .
the problems with sis ii do not involve the infrastructure that it shares with vis .
the example of romania speaks for itself .
romania's external border is 2 000 km long .
i think they could be useful , and could produce the desired result significantly cheaper , faster and better .
i have participated in these debates from the very beginning .
i think it shows that there is a problem which needs to be fixed .
that is what we can do .
as regards the financial issues , I shall leave the floor to the commission to respond .
it is not a smokescreen , as has been suggested , to cover some political problems .
we were discussing this a year ago .
i shall limit myself to these few concluding remarks .
once again , I do , of course , undertake to keep parliament informed .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the council and the commission statements on 
your report rightly highlights the importance of reaching a settlement to the outstanding border dispute with slovenia .
it will assist croatia in taking the necessary steps to reach the final stage of the negotiations .
it is a condition for strengthening the rule of law and the proper implementation of the acquis .
this is an issue to which you have also drawn attention in your report .
we would like to take this opportunity to stress the strategic importance of turkey .
a comprehensive anti corruption strategy needs to be developed .
the ratification of the protocol to the convention against torture is vital .
it is a dynamic country with considerable potential .
we have taken note of the blueprint drawn up by the government of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia .
the internal cohesion of this multiethnic state is , of course , key to its future development .
let me start with croatia .
that was the message I took to both ljubljana and zagreb in january .
there are two equally important conclusions to this statement in the un charter .
first , the parties can choose any one of the methods outlined in the un charter .
i shall say a few words on cyprus .
i am also happy that agreements could be reached with workers in the shipping industry .
these reforms will be painful , but they are necessary and they can be made in a sensible form .
unfortunately that was not the case , but that is not what lies at the heart of this debate .
i would like to make one more general remark which also applies to macedonia .
there are bilateral problems , but they should not be allowed to block the negotiations on enlargement .
this is all about the negotiations between the european union and the individual countries .
this parliament must give a clear signal that both sides in all these disputes must be prepared to move .
this , too , has been included in the report .
public opinion in the existing member states is far less positive about this now .
criticism has been levelled at the police for failing to register complaints lodged by the public .
there is indignation about the demonstrative arrest of the mayor of the city of strumitsa and of other politicians .
firstly , turkey is not a european country , but forms part of asia minor .
thirdly , croatia has been ready to join the european union for a long time .
we cannot allow one country to join despite an unresolved issue and not the other .
on monday , your spokeswoman said that this could take place on the basis of international law and jurisprudence .
the president cut off the speaker 
i would refer to the national programme for reforms that has been set up by the present government .
i should like to mention a few points from this excellent report .
we hope that henceforth there will no longer be any reason for obstructing the subsequent accession talks .
that is how I understand the turkish statement on nabucco .
the temptation of blackmail is a bad counsellor .
in that respect , all credit to the rapporteur .
let them give back what they have stolen from our istrian and dalmatian refugees since 19then , and only then , can we talk about their accession .
this has not happened .
the main problem is the matter of the name .
there is a problem with the stabilisation of political institutions in macedonia .
in this respect , the forthcoming presidential and local elections in macedonia are very important .
the rule of law must also be guaranteed .
moreover , I would be grateful if we held it in brussels and not in strasbourg .
that shows how far behind we are .
turkey is asia , not europe .
we would lose credibility and the credibility of europe would be set back .
hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of people will migrate to countries like britain .
the way in which the problems in turkey are being minimised is starting to become impressive .
the balance sheet of more than three years of negotiations is positively lamentable .
let us therefore pull the plug .
the candidate country macedonia has also made huge progress .
cs I would like to make a few comments .
they deserve the opportunity to show their merit during the accession process .
we need to help them now and show that we have confidence in them .
turkey is not a european country , either geographically or culturally .
it is time for everyone to regain their freedom , independence and sovereignty , starting with cyprus .
these are major reforms .
i would like to see this happen as soon as possible .
thirdly , make progress on the cyprus question .
secondly , it must respect freedom of speech and thought .
there is a lack of civil and political supervision of the army , and this is simply unacceptable .
turkey has to deliver on long awaited reforms .
i think that joost lagendijk , rightly , said this .
mr posselt , the debate is closed .
i congratulate mrs oomen ruijten for this excellently drafted report .
enlargement is one of the great successes of the modern european union .
over the last year , we have seen significant progress and the intensive efforts of croatia in accession negotiations .
we would like to meet the growing demand for energy consumption from as many sources as possible .
to this end , the construction of the nabucco pipeline is of key importance .
nevertheless , hungary did not prevent romania from joining , because it considered european solidarity and tolerance more important .
i therefore consider it important for us to address the eu member states first of all 
no contract , no agreement , no society can be sustainable without justice .
a central element of that policy is cooperation with the icty .
firstly , the countries of the western balkans are part of the stabilisation and association process sap .
the next progress reports will be published in october 200these are updated on a regular basis .
these common positions are regularly extended and updated .
the european union will support the work of the icty until it has been completed .
i entirely agree that in the longer term , the legacy of the icty must be preserved .
we would not be credible if we did not hold firm to this .
i would like to make two points .
the socialist group has proposed two amendments to plenary .
that has led to confusion and a consistent postponement of deadlines .
the tribunal's work must be fully completed .
based on this assessment , the council should consider extending its mandate for as long as required .
rapporteur . madam president , I wish to thank everybody who contributed to this debate .
that has been a great pleasure .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday , 12 march 200written statements rule 142 
the greek communist party has abstained from the vote .
it refuses even by its presence to participate in the legitimisation of imperialist crimes by the european parliament .
question time council 
subject improvement of quality , availability and financing of long term care
president in office of the council . let me react to mrs harkin's question .
the presidency is fully aware of the importance of long term care in the context of an ageing population .
has any thought been given to a form of harmonised training , as these are new initiatives ?
the problem of ageing is one which we all share and we should approach this with some dignity .
the care provided by both informal and professional carers must be appreciated and organised by society .
subject unemployment in europe
president in office of the council . I should like to thank brian crowley for raising the question .
i agree with mr mitchell that we need a plan , yes , and we have some plans .
that is important in maintaining employment .
however , we must ensure that the required standards are not in conflict with the agreements mentioned above .
in a few years , the european union will ban the production of eggs from caged systems .
president in office of the council . I am not among the greatest defenders of the cap .
the czech presidency intends to pursue efforts at international level towards a successful agreement in copenhagen in december .
the forthcoming european council is also expected to agree key political messages .
climate change will be one of the topics discussed during the informal eu us summit in prague on 5 april .
now we will start its implementation , which involves a lot of technical work .
many of our younger constituents across the eu are telling our presidencies this very thing .
i do not have the papers with me so I will look carefully again .
we are ahead of the european spring council meeting and I would expect confirmation of all those ambitious goals .
yes , of course , we need to find common ground .
you are right that we can find a lot of synergies and there is no need to fight .
subject road safety
this is not surprising , as we are the country located right at the centre of the continent .
ro the eu has not done enough to reduce road accidents .
it is vital from the point of view of accidents , and particularly single vehicle accidents .
it is also and primarily the responsibility of the drivers behind the wheel .
we want to move the debate forward .
the next item is the green paper on the european workforce for health .
we need to reflect on the reasons why young people are not motivated to become health workers .
i also look forward to receiving contributions from the members of this parliament .
furthermore , an extension of imi to all regulated professions is envisaged .
the other half is why so many are leaving .
the key to this will be to find ways of recruiting and retaining healthcare professionals .
it is going to be tough but it can be comfortable as well .
perhaps , above all , we have to listen to the sharp end professionals .
we know from talking to midwives recently about the difficulty of getting professional indemnity insurance .
anyone you talk to will convince you that their system stands out .
you cannot have 27 different systems that are all the best all at the same time .
needless to say , a great deal of thought has gone into such a system in each country .
i can understand very well that this will meet with resistance .
there are plenty of reasons for more european involvement in the area of public health .
every year , alcohol abuse claims 195 000 lives and costs the european economy eur 125 billion .
there are also european trends , though , for example in the case of alcohol abuse among young people .
working in this sector demands a great deal from workers , and is often underpaid .
this is unheard of , of course .
it is therefore very important to regulate the principles of cross border medical care .
europe faces a number of challenges in sustaining and improving our healthcare services .
we cannot allow doctors to be on duty for too long .
i would also like to draw attention to the question of health promotion .
promoting a healthy lifestyle is a good prophylactic method which can prevent a variety of diseases and illnesses .
this shows that your contributions can be very helpful , because already some very important points have been made .
5th world water forum in istanbul , 16 22 march 2009 debate 
the un figures speak for themselves .
it has also improved water governance and management in acp countries .
the focus on the involvement of local actors has been one of the added values of this facility .
the eu will be represented at the ministerial segment of the world water forum by the current czech presidency .
member states are invited to participate with additional funding .
however , the problem is vast .
i have here with me a unicef brochure which dates from 200however , in the main , its statements still hold true and are striking .
that the sustainable production of food is directly linked to the efficient use of water.
it is the un that must be involved at the heart of matters concerning water .
appropriate finances will then , of course , be required .
unless this need is met , there is no point in talking about improving healthcare or developing education .
in other words , it hinders development and increases developmental inequalities .
a right is only bought in a society of slaves .
furthermore , is the state , or public ownership , the sole player in water policy ?
what does this phrase really mean ?
many , too many , people in the world are still denied their fundamental right to water .
the latest united nations report shows that , in fact , the situation seems to be getting worse .
all that is fundamentally important for this water forum .
the debate is closed .
the developing countries have committed to investing 15 % of their budgets in the framework of the abuja declaration .
nonetheless , budgetary support very much has the potential of meeting the shortcomings in southern healthcare systems .
thirdly , expertise must be enhanced .
this means , after an in depth discussion with the partner country , accepting the sectors proposed for support .
second alignment on national systems .
there is a wrong figure there , and it may well not be as bad as that figure suggests .
however , commissioner , I want to come back to the people .
what we do better will help people to be better , and then their economies could be better too .
child mortality in swaziland was 78 / 1000 in 1997 , compared to 86 / 1000 now .
in lesotho , life expectancy in the mid 90s was 60 , now only in kenya , more than 1 in 10 children die before the age of five .
end of quotation .
end of quotation .
that is why , commissioner , it is vital that we change the numbers in our health cooperation .
it is the issue of health conditions for the tuareg people in niger .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
implementation of the single euro payments area sepa debate 
when we drew up the accompanying legislation , the directive on payment services , we asked ourselves some questions .
we think it is undoubtedly time to do so .
the first question asks how the commission intends to promote and foster migration to sepa instruments .
the second question asks if a critical mass of payments will have migrated by the end of 20clearly we favour rapid migration to keep extra costs during migration to a minimum .
so the current pace of migration is too slow to attain critical mass migration by 20the third question was on the necessity of a clear and binding end date .
the fifth question related to how the commission is tackling the mif issue for card payments .
discussions with visa are ongoing as well .
payment services are a commercial activity .
lt at this difficult time , it is very important to find possible sources of economic growth .
parliament and the commission clearly share the same vision and the same goal for sepa .
therefore , we are asking in this resolution for there to be an actual ceasefire .
we are also asking if the european union can help to deliver desperately needed food and medicines .
we are no longer facing a crisis but what I think is already a humanitarian catastrophe .
this was confirmed to us by a wide range of independent sources , including the un and the icrc .
it is very important that the government follows up the most prominent high profile cases .
we certainly should not support a permanent ceasefire at this stage in case it allows the tigers to regroup .
then I turn my attention to amendments 3 , 4 and he saysi wish to bring to your urgent attention the civilian deaths in sri lanka .
i doubt that anyone would suggest that this is fabricated .
his words are reflected in my amendment and it is right that we should be concerned about these camps .
i therefore genuinely call upon you , please , to act wisely .
tamil people are people who own land .
therefore , they want to return to their land .
they are sri lankan .
that is why parliament passed its urgent resolution on sri lanka less than three weeks ago .
just imagine a member state of the eu in which terror has reigned for 25 years .
obviously civilians in this war zone are exposed to barrage fire from both sides .
i think we should prepare for post war order .
we have to revert back to peace mediation without winners or losers .
our focus must be on the people themselves .
i also hope that they do not have a specific segment of the electorate in mind .
it is not circumstantial .
ladies and gentlemen , I strictly applied the rules of procedure .

they also need reinforced help to consolidate their democratic institutions , statehood and rule of law .
we should not hold back our criticism with regard to internal developments in russia .
the first task is undoubtedly to convert the existing cooperation agreements into association agreements .
the goal is to establish a free trade zone with free trade agreements and gradually to abolish visa requirements .
the eastern partnership must also be open to belarus , but only once the conditions have been fulfilled .
if we dash these hopes again , we will be limiting our influence in the east in every respect .
if that happens , remember not to grumble about moscow's policies .
regarding funding , properly addressed , it will have to be in the next financial perspective .
thank you .
mr president , the eastern partnership is a project which covers six countries .
belarus has little in common with , say , georgia .
could the eastern partnership stand in for a black sea strategy ?
in other words , we are dealing with a common neighbourhood .
this makes that neighbourhood an area of conflicting interests and rivalry .
otherwise we will not achieve security and stability there , but the opposite .
when we were in minsk we obviously met the democratic opposition leaders and we also spoke with the press .
commissioner , in your speech which I was present for you talked about people to people contact .
young people , who are aware and educated , are the future of our continent .
external energy security policy is vital .
we know perfectly well the effect of this membership on russia .
the problem showed itself in fact when the new countries gained accession .
mr president , catch the eye is a good opportunity for polemics .
it gives support for both political and economic reform .
we are going into greater depth the association agreements are already very broad and deep .
we have to be patient with this very important policy , which we must continually try to develop .
i would say to mr szent iványi that we support the eastern partners in meeting our conditions .
i have always been in favour of that .
these are the major issues , on which all of you have made very valuable points .
we have to bring that together .
is there any news as to whether or not he will arrive during the debate ?
europe should decidedly continue supporting them .
this effort can bring tangible political and economic benefits .
based on our european experience , however , that will be more difficult if there is no integration .
the strategic partnership must be substantial in scope and of a gradual nature .
it is also true that brazil is very important to cooperation in relation to the wto .
naturally , mexico is also a partner that shares the same values and the same interests .
we must absolutely , therefore , help mexico .
we would like to complete the negotiations on two major aspects .
it is especially important to us that we strengthen the free trade agreement once again .
in addition , we share principles and values that are also a result of our christian heritage .
i hope such a summit may be held with mexico this year .
mexico and brazil are also playing an increasingly important role on the world stage .
however , this strategic partnership cannot avoid certain immovable points .
we are going to abstain on this report as well , for a number of reasons .
firstly , we believe that the report ignores negative consequences in economic terms .
it is a chance to call another summit and then things remain largely as they were .
the union is choosing the wrong priorities here .
there is a call for us to work together for the smooth conclusion of the doha round .
the subject of market access is a salient issue for both camps .
i have also looked at the draft recommendation from the perspective of my geopolitical interest .
that would mean an automatic cultural visa .
ro I wish to express my support for mr salafranca's report .
it promotes free competition in the area of air services .
however , this adds another dimension in the broad field of the external value of multilingualism .
it must be emphasised that europe regards mexico as an important partner for supplying raw materials .
the security of raw material supplies is specifically one of the key factors supporting europe's sustainable development .
i am therefore calling for the expansion of bilateral cooperation in the field of education and innovation as well .
thank you for your attention .
it is good that we are cooperating on a multilateral basis with this area .
however , it is important for us to achieve a balanced relationship between both partners in each case .
mexico was considered a shining example to be followed .
i applaud that decision and I think that we need to do this for every commodity .
i think it is very important to carry on with these special dialogues .
it has always gone in parallel with doha .
50th anniversary of the tibetan uprising and dialogue between the dalai lama and the chinese government debate 
there are two conflicting positions one of the parties is lying .
the eu can be decisive in the search for the truth .
as the radical party we propose satyagraha , the search for truth , as a collective global political initiative .
we need somehow to bring about the resumption of the sino tibetan dialogue .
the eu policy vis à vis china is one of engagement .
firstly , we support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of china , including tibet .
we have always said that this dialogue should address the participation of all tibetans in decision making .
in 1950 , communist forces invaded tibet , leading to the exile of the dalai lama 50 years ago .
we would certainly highlight the failure to allow free trade unions to operate within china .
we are concerned about the plight of religious and ethnic minorities across the whole of china .
at one time , the chinese authorities paid heed to our resolutions , but no more .
the dalai lama was here only in december , speaking on behalf of tibet in the plenary .
why is it necessary to revisit the issue again ?
schools suffered arson attacks and hospitals and mosques of the muslim minority were attacked .
the problem is it is beginning to be resented elsewhere within china .
protests 
but the problem is , to quote the beatles money can't buy you love.
tibetans still want a degree of cultural and political autonomy far beyond that which china is prepared to grant .
he will be 20 this year .
silence in the media .
his call for dialogue has had no positive response in beijing .
this is the bitter reality .
the isolation of tibet must stop for the inhabitants , for tourists , for journalists .
in the run up to the games , china gave foreign journalists some space .
sadly , it was short lived .
all the media have to submit to the censorship diktats of the parties .
this is a necessary step in order to get the dialogue between china and tibet going again .
we do not want dialogue , we want negotiations .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
written statements rule 142 
great countries and great nations should be magnanimous .

eu brazil strategic partnership 
i expressed the thanks of the european parliament at length on your behalf at the reception two days ago .
loud applause 
the next item is voting time .
oral explanations of vote
we can resolve disputes by listening carefully to all of the parties involved .
bg thank you , mr president .
i supported the turkey progress report .
thank you .
sk we know what a testing time our friends in the balkans have had .
this is modern turkey , governed by a fundamentalist , islamist party .
these are its values and we think that they are not appropriate for europe .
never has this saying been more appropriate than in the lamentable saga of the accession negotiations with turkey .
now , in reality , that is not the problem .
this accession procedure must be abandoned .
mr president , this report sets out turkey's progress towards eventual membership of the eu .
however , I do have some concerns about turkey's progress towards membership .
greece's stubborn obstruction of the start of negotiations for accession is beyond comprehension .
the naming of the country must not be an obstacle !
yet it is time that this parliament listened , for once , to those it is supposed to represent .
mr president , I was very pleased with the vote today .
i am not in favour of mr milošević he was a baleful and wicked communist .
mr president , I voted in favour of this resolution and report , but I have some concerns .
i reiterate the issue around food production standards , which are higher in the european union .
explanations of vote continuation 
four priority areas were identified where progress is essential namely
open recruitment and portability of grants ,
training and skills of researchers 
these areas deal with mobility , transparency , publicity and support to researchers and potential researchers .
for some , this might mean having access to resources beyond the borders of their country of origin .
these arrangements also encompass phd students , who carry out the lion's share of research activities .
women continue to be under represented in most areas of science and technology and in positions of responsibility .
it is essential to make the selection and promotion processes open and transparent .
mr president , I voted in favour .
new technologies have now transformed our lives , and leisure activities are by no means excluded from this process .
lectures from eu institutions have almost the opposite effect .
it is therefore our duty to protect consumers , especially children .
for this reason , we must pay particular attention to the pegi system for rating games .
children imitate the games which can lead to tragic results .
last tuesday was a fairly typical day at the gaza crossings .
in writing . I voted against this report which seeks to establish a common aviation area with israel .
it would be superfluous for me to repeat here the reasons that led to my vote of approval .
it further condemns the attacks on civilians as documented by the international crisis group .
what purpose does it serve in finding a long term solution ?
peace talks must involve all parties .
under all circumstances such a treaty must deliver a self governing tamil region in the north east of the country .
last night , mr tannock and mr van orden argued for the complete opposite .
soil deterioration is a problem which cannot be ignored .
however , these are short term actions .
we still believe that these problems can be overcome by breaking with these agricultural policies .
i have voted against this report .
i therefore support this resolution .
this proves that immigration is a human drama which creates inhuman situations .
the problem of immigration will not be solved like this .
i have therefore voted against this resolution .
however , I would like to emphasise that it is not enough to make a commitment in this respect .
then , and only then , will we be able to discuss croatia's accession to the european union .
i voted in favour of the motion for a european parliament resolution on turkey's progress report 200the report unfortunately comprises both serious lacks and misdirected demands .
the armenian genocide is not mentioned at all , which differentiates this report from earlier resolutions from parliament .
mrs oomen ruijten's report is much too weak in this regard .
for that reason , we are sad to say that we feel we must voteno.
paragraph 45 of mrs oomen ruijten's report contends that the eu's accession negotiations with turkey should be expanded .
we sincerely believe that the eu has a tremendous potential to effect change .
this is especially evident in the current behaviour of the turkish government towards the doğan media group .
religious minorities continue to be discriminated against and harassed .
there is no macedonian ethnic minority .
these provide for the halving by 2015 of the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water .
not even water can escape the privatising and liberalising zeal of the majority of the european parliament .
i voted against this resolution in the final vote .
sustainable development cannot be imagined without the protection and proper management of the vital resource of water .
yet even in developed countries we are seeing serious water shortages .
the international community must take access to water much more seriously before it is too late .
access to clean water is a basic human right , so let us make it a major campaign .
i voted to adopt the resolution on an approach to health services in sub saharan africa .
often , the average life expectancy in individual countries is similar to that in medieval europe .
there is nothing more human and , at the same time , european .
it is therefore important to be able to experiment with new forms of aid .
our own country , sweden , is currently looking for new and interesting paths .
we could not support this resolution in the final vote because these amendments were accepted .
i voted in favour of this report .
this is proven by the various political agreements throughout history to the present day .
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
are there any comments ?
i would like to speak on the subject of china .
we must therefore impress upon the government of guinea bissau that those responsible must be found .
this is therefore also essential for our own european security .
the state's inhabitants live in chaos and there is a shortage of water , medicine and schools .
although the elections held in 2008 were peaceful , an initial assassination attempt took place shortly afterwards .
at the same time , a cocaine smuggling route passes through the country .
i would like also to send condolences to their families .
there should be no impunity .
the debate is closed .
this is therefore an issue that is of central importance for the european union .
they are often held together by force , and the army's power is great .
they get the chance to behave badly by providing the rulers of these countries with privileges and wealth .
abuses of this nature bring into being counter movements .
opposition members freed by court order are then locked up again by the state , regardless .
the resolution rightly calls for greater efforts in respect of mediation , compromises and peaceful solutions .
in the philippines , both the moro islamic liberation front and communist partisans are active .
the kidnappings continue .
expulsions of ngos from darfur
a few people still argue that what has happened in darfur is not genocide .
of course , if bashir refuses , then he should be prosecuted with the full force of international law .
the united nations has said that kicking out the humanitarian groups puts more than one million lives at risk .
in the western region of darfur , the government seeks to prevent such a secession by all means .
in that region there has always been a conflict of interests between nomadic herdsmen and settled farmers .
in this dirty work , the government can do without foreign observers , aid workers and mediators .
the population has been affected by one of the most serious humanitarian crises in the world .
the court accuses him of authorising genocide , murder and displacements , as well as tolerating torture and rape .
a war against the people of southern sudan has been going on there for decades .
this is a humanitarian disaster brought about by the genocidal policy of mr al bashir .
witnesses have reported cases of diarrhoea in the zam zam camp and cases of meningitis in the kalma camp .
omar al bashir's decision to expel charitable organisations from darfur will result in further crimes .
madam president , one of the greatest human tragedies in the contemporary world is taking place in darfur .
that is not impunity impunity is to continue as you are for many years .
according to the un , almost 5 million sudanese people currently need urgent aid .
we must not therefore give in to this blackmail .
it is clear that we need an international coalition to put pressure on president al bashir to abandon this position .
i would , however , like to put a question to the commissioner .
we are aware of the african union's position on the al bashir case .
it appears that there are double standards here .
author . madam president , I have two oral amendments .
one is on recital b and the other is on paragraph concerning paragraph 4 the amendment is in two parts .

i think that this invitation should never have taken place .
the system in ireland is as strong , or as weak , as that eu framework .
as we all know , the regulatory system has failed globally .
the president cut off the speaker 
in intergroups , meps can unite across the political divide to deal with particular issues .
this is being carried out by every single political group , apart from the patriotic attack party .
mr president , in january the commission attacked the hungarian moratorium on genetically modified maize mon8the moratorium is clearly supported by the whole hungarian scientific community , all political parties and hungarian society .
fr mr president , one of our fellow members has just spoken about the issue of intergroups .
do not allow more or less secret sub groups to meet during the next parliamentary term .
pl mr president , there is no denying the demographic crisis taking place in europe .
in any case , it is unacceptable .
following the company's insolvency application , they are waiting until 30 march for a solution .
can I please underpin the comments already made by a few colleagues about the importance of intergroups ?
when a major accident happens , those who live along the coast pay the consequences .
we know the risks that these ships bring in areas such as this .
he committed murder and plunged many people , including his own family , into grief and despair .
his family too have lost a child and their world too has been turned upside down .
are we doing enough to protect ourselves and our children ?
if we want safe food , because only safe foods can and should be european foods 
if we want food adequacy , because only thus will we be able to deal with crises 
it is worth taking note of this resolution .
i need hardly say that neither power plant will be using ccs .
i hope the european union will give neither political nor material support to this .
ladies and gentlemen , to whom does the revoz car production plant in novo mesto belong ?
the russians have now deferred these important talks indefinitely .
the european union's energy independence and member statessolidarity in this matter are more necessary than ever .
this is exactly why it is more important now than ever for us to stand united .
we must take a stance against anti european discourse , against ultra nationalist elements which are destructive and dangerous .
thank you .
we commemorate the event every march , and the presidents of two other countries did so as well .
they did not necessarily aim to get the best development outcome .
the third assurance I want is on the most favoured nation mfn status .
we only have the choice of voting yes or no .
what kind of problems have come to our attention during the course of the negotiations ?
first of all , it seems rather questionable as to whether the timeframe was sufficient .
of course , the commission is in a good position .
it was able to lead the negotiations , call a vote and involve the member states .
exports from the acp countries will only make up a small percentage of its imports .
the increasing food prices in the acp countries are the undeniable proof of this effect .
finally , there are also questions regarding mode if goods are to move freely , should people not be allowed to do so , too ?
i have now been chairman of the committee for international trade for two and a half years .
the collaboration was successful and I think we have achieved a great deal .
thank you very much .
this is essentially what the interim agreements are all about .
the economic partnership agreements seek to guarantee continued trade and development in some of the world's poorest countries .
i do not believe that there is an inherent conflict between trade and development as some speakers claim .
quite the contrary trade leads to development , duties lead to poverty .
in these times of uncertainty , the world needs more trade , not less .
trade can provide an excellent contribution in this case .
why do we have to do this ?
no , the governments of the acp countries did not accept continuing negotiations under pressure or threats .
we want specific commitments and I would like to list them one by one .
the second fundamental subject for which we are awaiting a response concerns the singapore issues .
on this point , I want particularly to emphasise public procurement .
the third point is services .
we know that the loss of customs revenue will cause a reduction in the budgets of our partners .
the fourth point , and this has already been mentioned , is that food security must be protected .
is the commission prepared to propose similar measures in other regions ?
i have been delayed getting here and have managed to arrive at the last minute .
so we have to do that that it is the first thing .
developed and developing countries are facing an unprecedented financial and economic crisis which has gripped the entire world .
we should be very uneasy about this .
i am aware that other questions have been raised which commissioner ashton is ready to answer .
thirdly I would like to reassure parliament concerning the important matter of access to medicines .
special attention will be paid to strengthening the regional integration programmes and ensuring a sustainable future for them .
as an example we might mention here the comprehensive epa intended for the west african economies .
however , each region has its own specific characteristics which must be taken into account .
we must respond to the current crisis by establishing further partnerships and not by restricting them .
i believe that today's plenary session is an important step forward on economic partnership agreements epas .
one thing is clear all put acp development at the centre of epas .
in fact , we would rather seek to strengthen than limit acp rights and capacity in these areas .
these you will need to redress , I do apologise if I missed you saying that earlier on .
the assent procedure for cariforum states and côte d ivoire is crucial to realising the potential of these reforms .
approval of these signed agreements will allow for a formal negotiation procedure to progress .
this is something which I believe you have taken to heart and that you are working extremely hard on .
a few weeks ago , I attended the most recent regional acp summit in guyana .
the text contained in the sadc epa resolution presents a good compromise .
first of all , we have to recognise that there is only one full economic partnership agreement today .
secondly , on the trade front , as you have pointed out , we have historic ties .
we plunder everything there is and take all the riches .
it is essentially a legal requirement based on the rules of legality laid down by the world trade organisation .
if you do not believe me , take a look at your documents before you vote on wednesday .
you can also read about the right to establish funds for individual inhabitants .
these measures relate , for the most part , only to trade and competitiveness .
the ors are at the heart of aliving basin.
despite these concerns , we should welcome the assent of the inta committee for these epas .
that is very important for us .
the issue of bananas was raised .
there is also the issue of haiti .
we meet with ngos , we meet with smes .
it is a failure and I think that has been said already .
the agreements make provision for monitoring and reviews that will involve parliament .
i look forward with personal interest to your vote tomorrow .
we all know that it will help the development of these countries .
i was pleased that she also made commitments on most favoured nation status .
we would love to see monitoring .
that is the only way we can understand what you are going to negotiate .
this was the case regarding bananas and on cotton for other countries .
i know how complicated it is and I am very grateful that she is helping me in this matter .
here , too , I am satisfied that we have achieved a compromise which I can wholeheartedly support .
finally , mr president , there is something else we have to address , namely the product claims .
we also ought to examine them and bring them up to date .
i would also like to offer particular thanks to the commission , whose cooperation was extremely constructive and successful .
others would not .
i should just like to address a few points .
as I said , this regulation is also part of our simplification programme .
there are probably few people around who could really understand it .
that is why we have come up with a significant simplification of eu legislation .
the commission takes note of the concerns of member states on the recasting of directives into regulations .
yet , I find that the critics often tend to stop short .
and we have a directive turned into a regulation .
she wanted to support clear labelling of products about the content of nanomaterials .
we are making history with this vote .
until now , it had continually stressed that the existing legislation was sufficient to guarantee the safety of nanomaterials .
it was brought onto the market without sufficient explanation of the risks .
i also sincerely hope that we will finally have an open debate on the purpose and uses of nanotechnology .
in fact , we still do not know very much about it .
should we , then , allow an active substance in cosmetic products with absolutely no means of control ?
after all , developments in chemistry and in cosmetics itself have brought enormous and fundamental changes .
these can have both positive and negative effects on human health .
we have taken the first step with this regulation .
congratulations , commissioner .
sometimes the same substance works on me one day , but does not work the next .
da mr president , we all use cosmetic products .
we are happy that our prohibition on cmr substances has been retained , but made more appropriate .
however , the most important thing is that nanomaterials have at last been included .
it is as though the industry has tried to stifle the debate on the safety of nanomaterials .
this modern regulation at the same time reduces the administrative burden for european producers employing more than 350,000 people .
i do not agree that messages about the content of nanomaterials in products should take the form of warnings .
i also welcome the fact that the directive will actually become a regulation and will have greater legal emphasis .
whereas the positive characteristics of nanomaterials are more or less familiar , the risks are largely uncharted .
no one has expressed a wish to take the floor .
as mr davies said , we have really provided a good example of what european legislation can achieve .
we have , indeed , succeeded in banning animal testing .
however , labelling allows consumers to choose .
the vote will take place tomorrow , tuesday , 24 march 200the placing of biocidal products on the market new biocides revision proposal debate 
the commission statement on the new proposal for a revision of the biocides directive .
this is why I would like to thank my colleagues who supported this compromise between the three institutions .
we cannot run the risk of losing important products because their registration has not been completed .
important areas now have to be urgently harmonised and regulated .
no one wants us to lose our high hygiene standards .
any carelessness on our part may have irrevocable consequences .
i would like to thank again my colleagues , the shadow rapporteurs , with whom we cooperated very well .
the first point is on the role of parliaments .
flexibility and pragmatism have therefore been necessary when apportioning the governance incentive fund .
this is also important from the point of view of demographic trends .
africa deserves our support , and not only for that reason .
i will now read it in english .
that is an important detail .
in this context , the fundamental aim of cooperation on development issues is to counteract past processes and mechanisms .
jomo kenyatta , the father of kenyan independence , described this in a vivid , albeit simplified , manner .
historically oriented policy is not , however , the only reason for europe's involvement in development related problems .
africa remains the poorest continent in the world .
that being the case , I hope that things will change in this regard .
we should continue with the efforts to involve those countries more intimately .
it is an organisation of politicians , who use it to participate in global political life .
africa is a continent with rich natural resources , which are used by the whole world .
let us remember how a peaceful kenya became drenched in blood within the space of a few days .
how can we ensure that financial aid from different countries is properly distributed ?
this is an issue we discussed a few months ago .
we also spoke about the steps china is taking .
perhaps china has found the right path ?
we should examine this path carefully .
let us work together to make these institutions more democratic .
in paragraph 46 she refers to african food security and food sovereignty .
such situations are really quite distressing .
furthermore , these investments do not provide any jobs .
secondly , I would like to thank the institutions involved .
both commissions have agreed , as have the two parliaments as well as the two councils .
i would like to comment on what mr hutchinson said .
back then , it would have been business as usual .
development and democratic governance in africa must form part of the crisis exit strategy for all of us .
however , not much progress was made in this field last year .
the leading global financial institutions are making the following predictions for 200the wto predicts a decrease in the value of global trade of as much as 9 % .
the second fact is that sub saharan africa is the poorest region on the planet .
let us take the fight against climate change as an example .
it is equally obvious that the role of the national parliaments and that of civil society are eminently important .
unfortunately , that is not yet the case .
we got an additional billion , however it was spread over three years instead of two .
i am therefore , naturally , entirely in agreement .
we do not intend to reopen dac issues .
i do not think that is the case .
it is not true to say that we are not contributing to the solution .
africa is no longer the exclusive territory of europe and that is very good .
it is indeed advisable to question the quality of the development policies set up between china and africa .
i am simply saying that a whole series of issues merit responses .
it is linked to ownership by civil society and by debate at parliamentary level .
i will come to parliament with that in april .
rapporteur . nl mr president , I actually do not have much more to add .
the commissioner has made the necessary remarks in that regard .
we will continue to follow this process .
what will the lifespan of such a project be and what will be the conditions for carrying it out ?
the report's conclusions are worrying .
these programmes were presented to and awarded by the member states last december .
collectively , these seven programmes represent approximately eur 1.8 billion .
the presentation is closed .
rapporteur . fi mr president , commissioner , subcontracting chains are commonplace in business .
common european problems have to be solved with common rules .
it will hold its first meeting on 25 march .
we therefore need to study its economic and legal repercussions in detail .
the presentation is closed .
worryingly , subcontracting may increasingly be used as a way of reducing direct social responsibility .
clearly , the enforcement of legal obligations becomes more difficult in long and complex chains of interconnected companies .
at the moment only eight member states have national legislation covering the responsibility of subcontracting undertakings .
it must be confusing for people to hear mr kamall speaking on a karim report .
the eu's trade in goods with india has more than doubled in value between 2000 and 200i want to stress that the fta must help 
achieve growing bilateral benefits for an ever increasing number of citizens
the eu is india's biggest foreign investor and trade partner .
india's investment in the eu has also risen , many times over , during the last few years .
food prices in europe short presentation 
the question we therefore have to deal with here today and in the future has two aspects 
the malfunctions in the supply chain and its practices are evidently putting terms of healthy competition at risk ,
i attach particular importance to this issue .
artistic studies in the european union short presentation 
this issue is occupying an increasingly important place at european level .
it is essential that it be promoted in europe's education systems from as early an age as possible .
innovation encourages the creation of synergies between traditional areas of activity and more innovative ones .
today we must combine technology and design , whilst integrating the principles of sustainability and economic viability .
this combination requires a redefinition of the ways in which knowledge is transmitted and acquired .
the debate is closed .
when I received the report , I began to read it with great enthusiasm .
we need to try somehow to communicate to them the idea of europe and the values of european unity .
my own idea was that there should be a unified , one year common european curriculum in history teaching .
i do not fully understand your desire to see ngos participate in the election campaign .
i very much welcome the report by mr hegyi entitledactive dialogue with citizens on europe.
the commission appreciates the unfailing support it receives from parliament .
for my part , I applaud your personal commitment as a member of the european parliament .
in writing . this is one of the most important issues which needs to be addressed .
the european population doesn't feel that they are european citizens .
most citizens do not feel part of the process and they view the european union as an institution apart .
gyula hegyi's report sheds light on an important contemporary problem .
we must make it possible for european citizens to have a more effective voice in shaping european union policies .
we need to ensure that appropriate information sources are made available in the less developed regions .
we need to know that decision making is in our hands .
the great unknown is always too easy a threat , and it is easy to join that particular chorus .
one reason is obvious the union has a very male face .
as we know , he always pays great attention to human rights issues and tragedies in africa .
the mass immigration that has taken place in recent years has brought this tragedy to eu countries .
i am going to turn my attention away from the text again for just a moment .
this is a debate that I myself have experienced in my own country in the past .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 24 march 200written statements rule 142 
i also highlight the importance of language as a factor of social inclusion .
i clearly recognise and respect these languages and at no point try to obstruct them .
i welcome your support for our approach .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 24 march 200written statements rule 142 
multilingualism must be a common denominator , not a factor of division for the european union .
we all know what they are , and opinions tend to agree from this point of view .
it can help achieve unity effectively in a world of diversity .
in this respect , we also insist on the need to preserve linguistic diversity in europe .
agenda for next sitting see minutes
documents received see minutes
no other part of the world has generated so much mutual cohesion .
it also adds a third component , namely that of territorial cohesion .
territorial cohesion also complements the existing policy of economic and social cohesion .
they come from all the member states .
i hope that we can continue to work together in this way in future .
applause 
cities generate more than 70 % of europe's vat .
cities and urban areas therefore need special attention within the framework of the cohesion policy .
i would like to emphasise two main ideas from the text of the report .
the first is the question of sub delegation , which means transferring control of european resources to cities .
this must change in the next programming period .
that is all for now .
but how should we approach these layers of society ?
here we need to distinguish between consumer credit and micro credit , for the two should not be confused .
your message is also clear on the need to strengthen the urban rural relationship .
i see this as a test case for territorial cohesion , which could then be extended to other macro regions .
we are working on this .
i share your view that we must continue to reform policy delivery .
however , there are certain considerations that we want to state .
the eu needs to do more by providing proper legal advice on setting up a business .
the need to strengthen small and medium sized enterprises and to link regional policy with industry and science 
firstly , the existence of geographical and demographic peculiarities in regions 
thirdly , the need to divide best practice criteria into mandatory and optional criteria and
cohesion is one of the most obvious successes of the european project .
spain has been a clear example of this , given the economic and social development that it has experienced .
mr van nistelrooij's report responds to the green paper on territorial cohesion published by the commission .
however , to date we lack a precise set of criteria to which we can refer .
we should take this into account when allocating funding .
it is a pity that we are discussing them all in one go .
the contribution of the european structural funds to environmental transformation is a future issue for territorial cohesion .
as a result , we must change course .
eu funds should not be used to promote programmes and projects which damage the climate .
you have not answered this question .
why do you remain silent on this subject ?
thirdly , so called territorial cohesion must contribute to economic and social cohesion .
fourthly , new objectives and priorities must be matched by new community financial resources .
sixthly , boosting the community budget in order to promote economic and social cohesion is absolutely essential .
i believe this must be active through the second pillar of the cap .
however , the rapporteur has successfully opened up a debate on this relevant topical issue .
madam president , I speak on the van nistelrooij report and to emphasise three points .
first , that territorial cohesion involves promoting polycentric development across the european union .
a higher degree of consistency requires transparency in relation to data and payments .
knowing how resources are distributed is an essential tool for highlighting and correcting distortions .
we are saying that we are facing a wall of silence .
therefore , it is logical for us to reject all attempts to renationalise the structural policy .
however much we value subsidiarity , european funds must be allocated on the basis of binding criteria .
we have already come to a consensus on this .
economic and social inequalities are constantly increasing 
regional development within capitalist frameworks cannot remove class conflicts in the system 
we can see that the share allocated to the french regions is continually shrinking .
however , I have the impression that in some cases both of these policies have identical objectives .
one more comment on financing in my opinion , modulation is not a nice word .
this discourages the beneficiaries and fuels criticism from the inspection bodies .
so then , the benefits cannot be denied .
mrs hübner , the commission holds the key to the effectiveness of these provisions and budgets .
the president cut off the speaker 
it is a debate about retreating from any kind of sector by sector treatment of european policy .
above all , I would like to emphasise once again what we found to be our most important points .
the eu budget must include a budget for these micro credits .
these micro credits are primarily granted at the local level .
for that reason it is very important that an activation policy be implemented at the local level .
i would like to single out two of these measures and reinforce them .
it is right that this period should now be reduced to three years .
the same criteria should not be applied to innovative projects as to other projects .
bg what are the basic objectives of the micro credit initiative ?
territorial cohesion is not meant to focus exclusively on regions suffering permanent handicaps .
to finish , I would of course like to thank all our rapporteurs .
ro I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for producing the regional development package .
europe's regions will develop in different ways unless they are coordinated via a single eu policy .
pl madam president , cohesion policy is the main pillar of the integration process .
it is particularly important that we coordinate and properly plan support for rural areas .
there is also a significant disparity among these areas in individual member states .
romania has a considerable number of such populated settlements .
however , I should like to say something before we move on to thecatch the eyeprocedure .
i only regret that none of them refer to cultural policy .
widespread use of micro credits is a good instrument for cohesion policy .
the president cut off the speaker 
you have run out of time .
this is important not only in a time of crisis .
it is a pity that we still do not have a concrete legislative proposal on the table .
i also approve of the allocation of additional funding for improved internet access in rural areas .
supporting sustainable competitiveness is the most effective way to achieve cohesion in the european union .
what also clearly emerges from the debate is that we need both continuity and reform in policy delivery .
we have been working with your great support over the last months on this challenge .
some of you mentioned the question of transparency .
we have many regional and local urban strategies that have successfully integrated culture into our policy .
we are also completing the independent study by a group of researchers and experts chaired by professor fabrizio barca .
the public has a very ambivalent view of european structural policy .
the reports which we have just discussed form a good foundation for this process .
this will allow european added value to be created for the european union .
european funds are in fact one of the most visible and effective manifestations of european integration .
the green paper is therefore the beginning , rather than the end of the debate on this matter .
different regions have quite different problems in terms of income levels , geographical location , migration , etc .
in my view , mr baco's vote is more of a misunderstanding .
in my report , I expressly stated that rural development resources cannot drain direct payments .
i am pleased by mr nicholson's support on this issue .
i am very pleased to see that over eur 100 billion is to be invested in protecting the environment .
i hope that this will begin in the second half of the year .
i consider it important that we continue to encourage people in this regard .
that is of considerable importance .
the second point is that there must be no frittering away of our funds .
written statements rule 142 
people from rural communities are in a particularly disadvantaged position when competing in the labour market .
these are fundamental conditions for the development of areas which are distant from large urban areas .
a micro credit can be accessed by companies with fewer than 10 employees .
the idea can just as well be applied to the unemployed , business start ups or existing micro enterprises .
this is extremely important to the countries that were relegated to the background under the yalta agreement .
this alone makes it paramount that we let this part of the eu budget through today .
similarly , trouble free implementation of programmes and projects with eu support requires high quality management and control systems .
territorial cohesion plays an important role in this respect .
this legislation must create a simple and effective procedure for selecting contactors .
excessively long tender procedures can delay realisation of structural funds .

rapporteur . mr president , I will be very brief .
as rapporteur , I was rather unsatisfied with the outcome of the votes on the amendments .
the placing of biocidal products on the market 
combating female genital mutilation in the eu 
before the vote
it is important to us that the sexual and reproductive rights of women are recognised .
mr president , this is indeed a point of order .
heckling 
so this is a point of order concerning clarification .
we shall now proceed to the vote .
green paper on territorial cohesion and debate on the future reform of the cohesion policy 
it talks about something very fundamental in the way we disburse our aid .
ms martensreport takes into account accountability and transparency , so I support it .
the european union owes its success to the gradual raising of economic barriers .
as a member of the acp eu assembly I agree that development aid is not always effective .
i believe that , if we do that , they will flourish far better and live far longer .
art education develops sensitivity and opens up creative potential .
we have also beaten the english , the french , the italians and the scottish .
sport is art , art is sport .
turkey's membership of the european union means economic and demographic death for bulgaria .
this is why we voted against this report .
that is its failure .
it is my experience that more and more people are losing faith and trust in institutions .
fi mr president , mr hegyi's report is excellent and necessary .
we need active dialogue between european nations and citizens .
we need understanding on both sides .
i can give you the answer .
this also applies to the documents drafted by participants in the debate from other countries .
no wonder the european union is so unpopular in my constituency of north east england and elsewhere in europe .
we completely ignore the result of the vote !
for a long time we thought that the only thing that affected us was what we swallowed .
one member state has saidno, we are listening and indeed we have to listen .
i hope the court of human rights takes our statement into consideration when delivering its verdict in this case .
it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for giving me the floor .
children are dying and women are dying precisely because of these practices , which are completely unacceptable .
i consider the commission notification in this area to be exceptionally important .
this has happened to me in this case and it is something that I did not wish for .
the reason was that we would like in particular to guarantee the status of minority languages .
i am sorry , but this is madness .
it will lead to the opposite of adaptation and assimilation .
that is the opposite of what is actually required in all european countries .
we have been told here today that the report deals withcertain national quarrels in spain.
mr president , I would like to congratulate mr van nistelrooij on his report .
we in this parliament must continue to insist that they do .
worldwide credit unions have reserves in excess of usd 1.1 trillion , with almost 180 million members worldwide .
at this stage , let me pay tribute to two organisations in particular .
written explanations of vote
your rapporteur takes the view that the timely collection of statistical information is of paramount importance .
in particular , where is the security council representation for asia ?
i am happy to give my support to it .
i am pleased that these recommendations extensively touch on these concerns .
now that we are facing an exodus of biblical proportions europe has suddenly been startled into reality .
i repeat that I am opposed to the report on those grounds .
lisbon , after all , has been legally dead since the referendum in ireland .
i wish to abstain on the report by mr hutchinson on mdg contracts .
this is particularly important in order to make it easier for art students to study in another member state .
in writing . it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour .
all children are born artists .
the problem is to remain an artist as we grow up . 
that body of knowledge is very large , and it is constantly growing .
this approach is flexible , and allows coordination of complex matters and a rapid reaction to current challenges .
i think it is quite the opposite .
communicating with citizens and keeping them informed must stop being simply a prescribed , ineffective proposal .
in this context it appears that the background to this report is to some extent contradictory .
it is therefore hard to speak of dialogue and compromise .
the key to effective dialogue lies in the present day , which has brought us enough problems anyway .
we need to talk !
i cannot therefore fully endorse the report .
people accept what they know , but anything that is beyond their horizon arouses concern .
each year alone I organise hundreds of meetings with young people , farmers and businessmen .
the june elections will be the first test of how effective we have been .
since the actions far more resemble propaganda than dialogue , I oppose them .
in a real dialogue , the opinions of the citizens are seen as valuable .
unfortunately , he is correct .
i am against the report by mr cornillet on the work of the acp eu joint parliamentary assembly in 200i am therefore against the tabled report .
they look pretty nice indeed .
frequent modification , by certain member states , of eligibility criteria and requisite documentation 
inadequate decentralised administrative capacity 
lack of clarity in cofinancing rules 
few opportunities for interregional cooperation , and regional structures that are inadequate for this cooperation .
respect for the principle of equal opportunities and assurance of the principles of partnership and innovative action 
we also think that some wordings pre empt the rural population's own choices .
i voted against the report by mr roszkowski on complementarities and coordination of cohesion policy with rural development measures .
therefore , I did not endorse mrs roth behrendt's report .
the regulation also introduces more stringent requirements for detailed product descriptions .
another objective is to increase the safety of cosmetic products .
however , I regret one omission , which I feel could be prejudicial to consumer protection .
the proposal was intended to simplify existing legislation .
a little coherence , please .
either it is health that takes precedence or it is the market .
experience has shown that a policy of high prices is not an effective method of combating nicotine addiction .
in order to contain this phenomenon , fine cut tobacco must be able to act as a substitute for cigarettes .
i trust that our message will nonetheless reach the council of ministers , which needs to rule unanimously .
i also find it lamentable that the rapporteur waters down the commission's proposals .
this report deals with a very serious problem and the need for measures to tackle it is made clear .
we need comprehensive strategies and action plans to allow us to protect women from the archaic tradition of circumcision .
i see no reason to throw particular suspicion on people who request asylum on these specific grounds .
i believe that enforced medical check ups constitute a massive invasion of privacy .
for this reason it is exploited by some groups in support of abortion .
the linguistic and cultural diversity of the european union is a huge competitive advantage .
the costs and bureaucracy associated with the misguided policy of multilingualism will only increase as the eu expands further .
i therefore believe that we should have a handful of working languages .
that is not a matter for the eu .
we have therefore voted against this report .
this is why multilingualism must offer new solutions to europe's citizens and our society .
this is a missed opportunity for the eu to come closer to its citizens .
one of europe's virtues is its multicultural nature , which is also expressed in multilingualism .
however , the report focuses more on learning the official languages than on implementing the idea of multilingualism .
this is not and must not be the nature of our debate .
they are also more creative and have broader horizons .
the language competences of the citizens of a united europe should constantly be extended .
multilingualism is an area with wide ramifications .
it has an enormous impact on the lives of european citizens .
definition of territorial cohesion 
integration of territorial cohesion in the future development of all community policies 
establishment of a comprehensive system of gradual transitional assistance to the transition regions and
i therefore voted in favour .
the eu's cohesion policy is badly thought out .
i live in poznań , the regional capital of wielkopolska .
urban development has nothing to do with local centralism .
some of these tasks involve close collaboration with local governments at other levels .
in writing . the urban dimension of cohesion policy needs to be given a greater priority .
i endorse adoption of the report .
at the moment , discussions about measures for relaunching credit activities are on the agenda .
these people have few options available to them .

applause 
i have great pleasure in giving the floor to the british prime minister , gordon brown .
friends , today there is no old europe , no new europe , no east or west europe .
there is only one europe , and it is our home europe .
we are uniquely placed because of what we have achieved in our union .
applause 
i know that some critics suggested that I was supporting global action more because I supported european action less .
no european country is immune from its impact .
it is hitting every business , every worker , every homeowner and every family too .
applause 
just as globalisation has been crossing national boundaries , we know it has been crossing moral boundaries too .
applause 
first , the market is there to serve us we are not here to serve the market .
we also have a responsibility to the unemployed .
applause 
europe has , therefore , a particular responsibility in the current g20 process .
we want the london summit to succeed , and I am sure it will succeed .
the commission will monitor and evaluate what member states are doing to coordinate our overall response to the crisis .
only in this way will confidence be restored , and confidence is key .
g20 finance ministers discussed at length the treatment of impaired assets less than two weeks ago .
in london , the european union must also give a strong message rejecting protectionism .
indeed , employment is our first concern now .
applause 
the eur 400 billion european aid programme will help us overcome the crisis .
we need to speed up thebasel iireforms and bring speculative funds under strict control .
it is an excellent direction .
applause 
for this reason , your visit is more than simply a visit to the european parliament .
thank you very much for this , mr brown .
this has been a permanent feature of human history and will always exist .
this is about a system in which this individual greed can spread and become destructive .
this is why it must be changed .
this is precisely what must be done .
you are right when you state that the nuclear arms race must be stopped .
you are also right that we need solidarity between people in society , but also solidarity between states .
i would like to make one final point .
above all we need an effective struggle for a better climate policy .
combining these two things is exactly the right approach .
applause 
opportunities to work with the obama administration should not be spoilt by a transatlantic war of words .
we need a european financial services authority .
we need the imf to fill that role .
the era of easy money is past .
for future growth , making a living must not equate to making a killing .
and those parties pushing themselves and britain to the sidelines of europe will cost their country dear .
so let britain be a positive partner , cast in the european mould .
prime minister , I expect the single currency to emerge stronger from this crisis .
nice speech , mr brown , but what are you ready to do , really ?
the european union has followed others in succumbing to this temptation .
this speaks volumes of the nature of the challenges of our times .
perhaps you would have more moral authority in this house if your actions matched your words .
once again today you try to spread the blame around .
we are now running a deficit that touches 10 % of gdp an almost unbelievable figure .
you know , and we know , and you know that we know it is nonsense .
everyone knows that britain is worse off than any other country as we go into these hard times .
the imf has said so .
if we do not understand the problem , we will not be able to understand the solution .
this has to be done and it has to be done by global cooperation .
more manufacturing is being done in asia than in europe .
we had domestic competition .
i believe that the lesson of this crisis is that we are now in a global economy .
that will require us to shape global institutions , and my message to this parliament is very clear .
welcoming a british prime minister to the european parliament is always a very exciting occasion .
however , at the same time , differences of opinion still exist between the main leaders .
the new decision is to be taken by 6 november this year .
it earned parliament's sympathy in a decision making procedure in which parliament formed its own opinion .
i would like to thank the presidency of the council of the european union for achieving this compromise .
question time is not being heard this week , either by the council or the commission .
people can come in here and speak at all sorts of great length .
both the eu and china would benefit from increased trade .
we heard prime minister brown talking about this in terms of the international financial crisis .
i also want to congratulate mr mitchell and thank him for his report .
thank you very much .
in any case , I believe that some sort of advantageous specialisation is necessary .
i am cautious with regard to this question of turning outward and inward .
for this reason , I am in favour of controls , but of a different kind .
over recent years a large section of the public has hardly been aware of their presence .
they should instead supplement each other's work and work together in a complementary way .
these projects require large amounts of machinery and are highly capital intensive .
thank you .
the european union's recovery measures are accompanied by mandatory measures of financial prudence .
it would be a serious issue if it were to go bust , like some of our commercial banks .
i thought the world had seen enough of clever financial tricks .
these eib operations are of utmost importance in an environment of global financial crisis and recession .
i am counting on the support of all the political groups of this house .
it is timely and welcome in particular for three reasons .
i hope that we will have the opportunity to return to these issues later .
what point have we reached today ?
that is what mrs stauner was hoping for .
we are therefore still in the hands of those who would like to take an initiative in this regard .
mr president , I want to thank all the members who have spoken in this debate .
i urge that on the three institutions represented here today and on the house .
i have raised this issue on a number of occasions .
look at this model for the developing world .
thank you , mr president , for the opportunity to respond to this debate .
all's well that ends well .
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports 
the system can also be expressed more simply .
abb and abm put the emphasis on and promote efficiency .
activity based management puts the emphasis on personal responsibility , but it also allows for freedom of action .
there is no need for inessential reports and planning .
bureaucracy and the fact that it is on the increase , however , are a real danger .
the commission has agreed to present an evaluation of this area .
this relates both to the european development fund and the athena mechanism .
congratulations !
this will be a decisive influence .
i cannot do this , even though I am chairman of the committee on budgetary control .
i am very grateful for your suggestions .
that means that we will already be groping around in the margins of the agricultural budget .
how high is the hit rate of the annual policy strategy in this respect ?
it is not a theoretical exercise . it is necessary in order to be able to manage money correctly .
we already have the current screening report thank you .
we want to make the abm / abb management tool better , not extend it over two years .
if it does not , it needs changing .
too much is left in the budget because we cannot change things because of the restrictions of the mff .
it is right for there to be a ban on eu public indebtedness .
how can achieving political objectives be compared with building a power station or transport networks ?
the same applies to the mid term review of the multiannual financial framework .
mrs grybauskaitė , I wish you the greatest success in the coming elections .
today we have heard what mr brown is proposing and what should be on the agenda .
all three institutions must find the political courage to do this together .
as the previous speaker said , it is not a budget for the 21st century .
it is clearly based on the idea that the eu's expenditure should just carry on increasing ad infinitum .
i would like to mention three points very briefly .
that treaty has been rejected .
firstly , we must acknowledge the limitations of the financial perspective agreement adopted in 2006 by the member states .
we cannot allow ourselves any more failed financial perspectives in the future .
firstly , our aspirations for the budget review itself .
in our view , it is unacceptable to focus only on the forthcoming financial framework .
this is particularly relevant , of course , if our demand for an extension should be implemented .
these include climate policy jobs and growth and foreign and development policy .
fourthly , we want a revised and fairer system for the eu's own resources .
this should clearly urge us to be cautious in the way our interventions are formulated .
it would be a failure for all of us .
that is indeed the position of this house .
we know that this revision will be carried out once the next european parliament is in place .
it is a crucial question which we must answer how much money and for what policies ?
we shall have to address two important difficulties in this major negotiation 
secondly , that the principle of cohesion and solidarity between the member states must not end and
just allow me to give you an example involving money from the solidarity fund .
this is what parliament is calling for very strongly and collectively in this report .
the debate is closed .
currently cohesion policy and measures connected with realisation of the lisbon strategy can count on the greatest support .
there is no prospect of improvement in the remaining months of this year .
further projects with a total value of several billion euro are already being planned for 200these projects involve not only car manufacturers , but also suppliers to the car industry .
the process will be painful , but it is inevitable .
more than 200 000 jobs throughout europe are dependent on the company .
there is no national solution to this problem .
there can only be a transatlantic solution which involves the parent company .
i would like to repeat some of what you have said .
the european automotive industry is the sector's world leader in technological terms .
this cutting edge industry must be protected .
the socialist group in the european parliament wants to protect jobs .
we also congratulate mr verheugen on the initiative he has taken with regard to this .
therefore , we need to find new approaches .
therefore , we should avoid taking shareholdings in the car industry .
i would also like to thank my fellow members for supporting the initiative involved in this resolution .
my group has tabled amendments on all of these points .
many european countries have introduced scrappage schemes and efforts in this direction have now begun in the uk .
in my country , austria , many thousands of workers are directly or indirectly affected by the crisis .
in addition , a large number of small and medium sized supply companies are dependent on the car industry .
we have a large general motors manufacturing site in vienna .
finally , a word about protectionist measures .
globalists all over the world unite !
however , in another very important respect , it is also a problem that has to do with overcapacity .
we need to support those people engaged in the car industry .
furthermore , I believe that the european parliament's activity in strasbourg should be discontinued .
hence this call , commissioner verheugen , to you and to the commission .
commissioner verheugen , it is not too late for action .
thank you very much .
in our resolution we have discussed short term measures .
we welcome the fact that you brought europe's ministers for economic affairs together to find a european approach .
secondly , you referred to the european funds that serve to relieve the social impact on workers .
i will fight for the future of their jobs .
we must tackle these challenges with a european , sectoral and forward looking approach and through social consultation .
the most important of these have already been mentioned .
we will be most socially minded and show the greatest solidarity if we support ecology and energy orientated restructuring .
the current crisis has also shown that the european car industry is strongly interconnected .
this is only right and proper .
i have confidence that our manufacturers , our technical specialists and our engineers can achieve this .
we have the potential to achieve this .
the banks are not providing funds .
the car industry is not the only sector which we are asking the eib to help with .
all of this is being provided by the eib .
i very much share mr groote's opinion on co2 based vehicle tax .
there is a certain amount of european solidarity involved here , which should not be underestimated .
the vote will take place tomorrow wednesday , 25 march 2009 .
the latter must be the subject of particular attention at both national and eu levels .
from 2012 we will have a schengen airspace .
the commission's initial proposal has been supplemented by two elements introduced by parliament .
the new specifications issued by easa must integrate with the existing ones .
in addition , the opportunity has been given to mention the derogations granted so far .
this has certainly been a major commitment and one that , I repeat , constitutes an effective response .
this second package of legislation will allow us to manage our airspace more efficiently in the years to come .
this organisation must be provided with the staff and equipment it needs in good time .
in addition , military no fly zones prevent planes from flying in a straight line from one airport to another .
the council has opposed this right until the end .
let us resurrect efficiency by allowing the supply to feed the demand and allowing innovation .
i would like to thank mr marinescu for his excellent report and the commission for its initiative .
however , we should not only be concerned about improving functionality here and now in the current crisis .
we should also continue to focus on important issues from the past .
it provides a few people with employment in the security checks at airports .
we are waiting impatiently for the regulation to be abolished .
there are , however , a few areas where I would seek a little bit of clarification .
its profits are set to drop by 12 % .
i do not see significant progress being made by russia , but we shall persevere .
since there was no possibility of including it , it was not included in the legislative text .
to conclude , I am grateful to you once again .
the lack of rules and existence of weak rules has given rise to the financial and economic crisis .
i also thank the french presidency and czech presidency for their efforts , especially thierry boutsen and vera zazvorkova .
the vote will take place tomorrow wednesday , 25 march 2009 .

regional airports may find it very hard to sustain the added costs of updating their systems .

interoperability of mobile chargers debate 
nowadays , anyone who changes their mobile phone generally needs a completely different charger .
this is not a new issue .
in the meantime , these difficulties have been overcome and there are no technical reasons which would prevent harmonisation .
we should under no circumstances exclude the possibility of introducing legal regulations .
the commission will not hesitate to make a legislative proposal if the industry does not introduce a voluntary agreement .
in addition , we should ask the standards institutes to produce proposals which will make this possible .
of course , this is not as easy as it seems .
on the one hand , we have the connection between the charger and the mobile phone .
perhaps we could involve the international organisation for standardisation iso in order to find a worldwide solution .
you then need to find a specific charger of a specific make and model .
my compliments , again , commissioner .
de madam president , I have a further question for commissioner verheugen .
the debate is closed .
common consular instructions biometric identifiers and visa applications debate 
i have been negotiating with the council for quite a long time .
you know that my group strongly opposes the extensive introduction of biometrics .
however , we have many concerns .
therefore , we cannot support parliament's position at second reading .
however , this does not prejudice our position on the lax report on the visa code .
however , this must not be done at the expense of the applicants and of data security .
i would like to thank everyone for their work on this dossier over recent years .
this is equivalent to a new city the size of birmingham .
in addition to that , we probably have one million illegal immigrants .
what we do not need is a system devised by the european union .
look at another example of eu legislation championed by the liberal democrats .
the introduction of fingerprints and photographs will ensure that the new visas cannot be forged or misused .
for this reason , I am supporting this more citizen friendly approach .
in the course of our work together , this has not always been the case , baroness ludford .
it will also result in an overall improvement in the eu's image .
i shall convey to my colleague mr barrot all that they have said today .
i think mr batten , as usual , was somewhat muddled in his thinking .
i thank all the other speakers who made constructive contributions .
written statements rule 142 
novel foods debate 
i must also mention the cooperation with the czech presidency .
i was also surprised that the commission proposal took the internal market as its starting point .
i will begin with that point .
that brings me on to my second point , namely what arenovel foods, actually ?
that was never really made clear in the commission proposal .
it relates to questions regarding nanoparticles and nanomaterial .
this is an extremely important issue and its importance is growing .
for example , we cannot demand that a novel food has no negative impact on the environment .
people have the right to know what they eat and make their choices accordingly .
if some people are concerned about nanotechnology , then they should be able to make a different choice .
we will see tomorrow how the members from germany have voted , because there is a labelling loophole here .
we do not want to take away the consumersright to choose for themselves .
thank you .
the commission has submitted a good proposal for updating the regulation on novel foods .
why should there not be a reference to nanosubstances in the list of ingredients ?
a brief remark on cloning .
it is animal cruelty and we are opposed to it .
nevertheless foods must be included in this regulation , because otherwise .
a major consideration is the strict regulatory system of labelling .
it would be more appropriate to regulate cloning in a separate regulation .
i also regard amendment 60 as important .
why do we respond as if we are scientific illiterates on any new aspect of this area ?
the same question can be asked of national parliaments .
if not , our credibility as legislators is in question .
through our input and our proposals , we will succeed in achieving this aim .
our atmosphere is formed in such a way that there are two different layers that protect us .
the co2 in the tropospheric layer holds in the warmth so that we do not get too cold .
that allows the member states the possibility of adopting more far reaching measures to protect the environment .
secondly , the use of the pesticide methyl bromide will be prohibited as of 18 march 20this also applies to the gassing of containers to control vermin .
the only remaining exception will be for emergencies , such as where a large scale epidemic occurs .
it has also been agreed , in this regard , that there must be no increase in laboratory use .
the benefits , both in terms of restoring the ozone layer and reducing greenhouse gases , will be considerable .
the montreal protocol itself has had additions made to it no less than four times .
it thus became necessary to amend the weak points in the treaty .
it will not cut global emissions and will not even reduce carbon intensiveness .
climate change is an environmental problem on a totally different scale from earlier problems .
let us learn a lesson from montreal .
that is fine , mrs doyle , please do so .
thank you .
in that way we will be obtaining precise information about this substance .
in every case , the result was satisfactory .
closure of the sitting
the sitting was closed at 11 p.m. 
the sitting was opened at 9.10 a.m. 
we should take a look at the history books , which have clearly been gathering dust .
markets are nervous , reacting immediately , excessively and negatively to every signal .
it is precisely here that most of the noise and criticism is centred in my view undeservedly .
the plan is allegedly deficient , slow and unambitious .
i would like to set the record straight .
the second major theme of the european council was the climate and energy question .
the gas crisis has not been resolved .
it is more than clear that we need this .
it proves that , even when times are tough , solidarity is not a hollow word in europe .
the debate that we held yesterday with the uk prime minister , gordon brown , clearly demonstrated this .
this is not a technocratic agenda .
people must be re installed at the heart of the global economy .
we are in favour of open and competitive economies , but economies in which the markets serve the citizens .
however , the european council also looked beyond the crisis .
this investment is critical in these difficult times .
we also need to continue to deepen the work of coordination .
we have some instruments .
this is my number one concern , and I think it should be the number one concern in europe .
you have a wealth of knowledge about action on the ground .
but it was in no sense the end of a process .
we need to keep up the momentum of the process .
applause 
this is the meaning of european integration .
we need more jobs , and this package of measures will allow this .
so what about obstruction by your own people ?
what gordon brown said yesterday was the opposite of what you said here .
that is what you said here a few moments ago .
that is not the level at which the european union can work with the us .
that is the big mistake that you are making here .
the president of the commission said something very important today .
we have no time for that .
that is the wrong signal .
i personally feel very sorry for you .
no problem , we are by your side and will do whatever we can .
applause 
laughter 
all these are welcome .
america will come to the g20 with her own agenda .
we must arrive with ours and together reach a deal that delivers for all .
see to it that domestic difficulties do not sap your stride .
together this means barely eur 20 million annually for each country which is part of the project .
in fact a decision has been made to refuse any kind of cooperation in this area .
at the summit eur 5 billion was also allocated to the anti crisis package .
what are the four elements of trust which roosevelt won ?
the first was reregulation .
even if gordon brown were the champion of deregulation , maybe this shows that change can happen .
secondly , strengthen the social fabric .
roosevelt's fourth issue was his economic investment .
one is that we need green eurobonds .
the conclusions of the summit in this regard are very vague .
throughout the crisis I have repeatedly questioned the commission about its desire to regulate and control the financial sector .
it continually refers to the right of the internal market to govern what happens .
the single currency is part of the problem , not part of the solution .
yesterday the government of the czech prime minister and eu council president mirek topolánek lost a vote of confidence .
following the collapse of the topolánek government president václav klaus has the strongest political mandate in the czech republic .
nevertheless , it is impossible that banknote printers will be the only ones to profit from this crisis .
it was not our decision that this summit would be a troika .
the lisbon treaty .
i have to say that responsibility for moving the situation forwards really lies with those who created the situation .
the commission .
i have to say that our ambition is to achieve political agreement at the june european council .
we will of course consult with you it is essential to have discussions with the european parliament .
we did not talk about how much money we would give to people .
he ignored the enormous debt burden he has placed on the british people .
europe needs no lectures from the british government about what must be done to get out of this crisis .
i am sorry , but I have not seen any concrete measures .
that is 0.04 % of this union's gross national product .
the imf has proposed that you invest 2 % of gdp this year and next year .
i ask myself how is that ?
please , we cannot do it in this way .
you cannot do it in this way . what we need is real investment .
we are on your side and will support you in getting that .
this unemployment crisis will not disappear because we refuse to have more meetings .
this is about the destiny of the european union's economic , monetary and social efforts .
if you can do that , we will be with you .
applause 
legislation governing the financial sector should have the effect of blunting rather than exacerbating economic cycles .
however , more regulation does not necessarily mean better regulation what we need is the right regulation .
i would like to highlight a few areas in which we need to continue to work .
his own record of managing the uk economy is one of negligence and catastrophe .
this is where the corrections should apply .
the agreement at the eu summit last week is not strong enough to instigate a new , sustainably oriented economy .
the european union must take a lead in that regard .
where is the eu's leadership when it comes to tangible funding ?
when I listen to the chairman of the socialist group , I think I am on another planet .
how can someone who has obstructed that for a decade today be declared our saviour ?
the economic and financial crisis has of course already been mentioned .
the czech social democrats have always supported the european constitution and have always supported ratification of the lisbon treaty .
what must we do to avoid these problems ?
now decisions are often taken on the basis of past history , how we behaved in situations of crisis .
pl mr president , during the recent european summit many subjects were raised .
we should be especially sensitive to the problems of new member states .
however , we are also living on credit as far as the environment and climate are concerned .
unfortunately , I do not believe that the czech republic alone is to blame .
this will require proactive interventions by member state governments .
the light touch regulation of the financial markets was always a road to rip off and corruption .
that is the question .
it is a charter for the policies of failure .
they resemble a victory statement of routed armies everywhere .
the election of václav klaus as president also belongs to the politics of double standards .
the treaty is now under serious threat and this is partly also your responsibility .
if you continue to govern in any form , you should make a clear stand for ratification .
it is important to have a european securities commission and to maintain the stability pact .
what is needed is the political will and unity which will make it possible to translate this into reality .
you were talking about a crisis of confidence .
the european parliament is not involved at all one month before the european parliament elections .
gm , the united states and sweden have been mentioned in the debate today .
another point is the solutions for eastern european countries and countries that are not in the single currency .
these countries are being let down somewhat , with a sum of eur 50 billion being mentioned .
i , too , had expected a truer european dimension in the approach to the crisis .
solidarity with less developed countries must also form part of the european union's global approach .
we , parliament , must set out our position clearly .
this sort of investment is furthermore especially suited to our times .
unfortunately , the summit was unable to convince people of this .
this must not be allowed to happen !
we must not allow the spectre of protectionism to wreak havoc once again .
the national supervisory authorities will also be given a better opportunity to coordinate themselves and exchange information .
policy must be appropriate even in times of crisis .
such language belongs to the machtpolitik cold war era , not to modern diplomacy .
that , my friends , is a recipe for fanning an uncontrollable forest fire .
president in office topolánek chose sweden as a comparison to america .
why not the czech republic ?
not only has financial credit contracted but also social credit .
therefore , a social european union summit , leading towards a european pact on employment , is a must .
programmes to facilitate the stabilisation and integration of the latter are crucial for the survival of the former .
i wish us all success in this matter .
where is the firm commitment to abolish tax havens and offshore financial centres ?
will they never learn ?
implementation procedures can be too clumsy and time consuming .
as usual a crisis provides opportunities for reform .
eur 5 billion for strategic energy projects and broadband internet .
is the glass half full or half empty ?
the first , of course , is jobs .
et several important matters were agreed upon in the council .
this is not rhetoric , mr topolánek , this is a call for action .
if self satisfaction and fiction were instruments of economic recovery , then we might call it a success .
the agenda for this council has already been expurgated of any proposals that might have related to employment .
that was postponed until may .
that is why we should also support commissioner kovács in tabling more proposals for progressive depreciation .
the decisions we took there were fundamental and important .
i would like to say one thing to those of you who have specific doubts and questions .
i would like to thank you for your very committed personal contribution .
good luck for the continuation of your work .
we can be proud of what we have decided , but there should be no room for complacency .
applause 
now we are waiting for a response from the six countries which have a direct interest in the programme .
applause 
i am referring to the two reports which follow .
aerodromes , air traffic management and air navigation services 
novel foods 
ec cariforum states economic partnership agreement vote 
it is up to you .
mr guardans cambó , we will take this as a test case .
madam president , the answer isyes.
the oral amendment was accepted . 
ec ghana economic partnership agreement vote 
ec pacific states interim partnership agreement vote 
ec eac partner states economic partnership agreement vote 
economic partnership agreement between the ec and cariforum 
the fact that she is here for this vote says much about her .
this vote was scheduled for tuesday .
de madam president , ladies and gentlemen , this is a point of order .
have no fear , I shall not read the entire letter .
de therefore , all references in official documents to rule 47 have to be deleted .
stepping stone agreement towards an economic partnership agreement between the ec and côte d ivoire 
rapporteur . madam president , I will be very brief .
eib and ebrd annual reports for 2007 
future of the car industry vote 
we still have two minutes left .
the next item is the vote .
oral explanations of vote
madam president , defined external frontiers are the essential attribute of nationhood .
i believe in equal treatment , and we can deal with an opinion .
on the marinescu report , I deliberately voted for the marinescu report .
this issue is still regulated on the basis of the 1944 chicago convention .
this is by no means the case .
madam president , it is always a pleasure to be present with you in explanations of votes .
people will start to talk soon .
madam president , I voted against this report for two reasons .
she is to be applauded for finding consensus on this issue .
i hope my words meet with your seal of approval .
we all know that the car industry is having some serious financial problems .
i could say that I think you and your two colleagues will probably owe me lunch after this .
across europe it represents over 20 % of manufacturing .
however , this is only possible if the biometric data are recorded correctly .
there still appear to be problems here .
an fab coordinator should also be introduced along the lines of the ten coordinators .
the commission proposal seeks to make the authorisation procedure more effective and transparent and to implement it better .
furthermore , where novel foods serve to replace another food , they must not be nutritionally inferior .
i have voted in favour of mr liotard's proposal on novel foods .
that is why I am in favour .
i have voted in favour of mr blokland's report on substances that deplete the ozone layer .
by taking this kind of action we are fulfilling our duty to both the current generation and future generations .
for example , it should be clarified that thescarceresources are defined by the eu .
in writing . it I am voting in favour .
that is the way that we are demanding for france and for europe too .
out of respect for these parliaments , I believe that we need to hold off on passing this resolution .
the affected ivorians would then be able to work as carers and in similar professions .
many of these nations also desire a strengthening of the provisions surrounding food security and infant industry .
the crucial objective of developing the agreements ,
the renegotiation of the contentious points of the agreements on the basis of an open and flexible approach ,
food security and the protection of the fragile industries of acp countries .
i do , however , intend to keep an extremely close eye on its implementation .
i have voted in favour of mr martin's recommendation on the ec / cariforum economic partnership agreement .
this is not a satisfactory development .
however , the resolution has come a little late and does not meet all expectations .
they point to a further fall in sales of new cars .
we should help the car industry to recover , but we should not try to reinvent the wheel .
in writing . car manufacturing within the eu depends upon reaching standards which can facilitate stronger environmental rules .
there are many european instruments which can be used to assist the car industry and its workers in particular .
in the automotive sector there is an enormous potential for moving in a green direction .
transport is responsible for around a third of all co2 emissions in the eu .
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
the report's second objective is to strengthen cooperation in practice .
there is much in the report with which the presidency , and the council , can agree .
the transatlantic relationship allows us to achieve together results which neither partner alone can deliver .
when we agree , we can set the terms of the global agenda .
high expectations were created on both sides of the atlantic .
all these initiatives are what many in europe have been calling for .
the dialogue with the us has been reinvigorated .
i welcome the pragmatic approach which has characterised these early contacts .
while the change of tone is important , it does not of course in itself deliver concrete outcomes .
your report is a valuable contribution to that process .
it is a process which will need to continue to be developed over the coming months .
firstly , energy security and climate change .
these interconnected topics are of concern to a great many europeans .
the eu has established ambitious energy and climate change commitments in advance of the conference .
thirdly , afghanistan is a key issue for both europe and the us .
we have engaged with the us , and the new administration , at every level from the outset .
we are looking forward to a busy eu us calendar .
we must seize this opportunity .
we must therefore develop clear positions based on our own common interests , and speak with one voice .
a strong eu is thus an important partner for the us in tackling global challenges .
protectionist elements on both sides of the atlantic need to be resisted .
this plays very much to the eu's strengths as the world's largest donor .
the new us emphasis on civilian capacity building and the regional approach focusing on pakistan converge with longstanding eu policies .
i am actively looking at whether we can provide additional funding in all of these areas .
the other day we also discussed it with richard holbrooke , the special envoy for both afghanistan and pakistan .
similarly , in the middle east we have been asking for closer us engagement from the very outset .
the eu also plays a major role in our eastern neighbourhood .
this will then set the scene for a successful eu us summit in washington , probably in june .
we also want these standards to be met by products supplied by the us to europe .
then we too shall have no problems .
either we do this together , or we will not be able to do it .
there are asymmetries between the two shores of the atlantic that negatively affect transatlantic cooperation .
therefore , the strengthening of the political european union is essential for future cooperation with the united states .
for data sharing , though , it must be a robust and binding legal framework of data protection .
the clearest demonstration of the change in approach from president obama is the intention to close guantánamo bay .
but such cooperation can only be supported if it delivers fair treatment .
finally I would like to address the subject of the alde group amendments which concern online gambling .
mr president , there is probably no important international problem which we could solve on our own .
i am not only talking about iran , iraq or afghanistan .
in spite of optimistic declarations , the future of nato is in question today .
the same applies to issues such as torture and rendition .
what exactly does that act state ?
the act prohibits us institutions and citizens from cooperating with , or passing information to , the icc .
the position taken in the report is unaccountably circumspect .
the document includes calls to set up two new combined eu us bodies and a proposal on this .
in my opinion literary creations of this sort should not be submitted to the european parliament .
we still do not know that .
china's gdp is catching up with that of the us .
fourthly , in points 31 and 32 there is a series of precise plans concerning russia .
we need to remind ourselves of what we want to achieve .
each of those initiatives can only survive if there is strong support from both sides .
one is the trade dispute agenda .
we would like to have a hearing on container security on both sides very soon .
this was agreed at our last tec meeting , but a follow up will be needed .
let us also remember about visas , which the united states still requires in relation to some member states .
this should not be happening in transatlantic relations between the eu and the us .
we ought to take advantage of that fact .
we need a stronger europe and a genuine partnership with the us to achieve the millennium development goals .
it is unacceptable for some of the european union's citizens to be treated as second class citizens .
i am thinking of european institutions , european universities and european foundations .
mr president , president obama said america has no better partner than europe.
the election of president obama started a new chapter in transatlantic relations that has suffered serious setbacks .
my second point I welcome president obama's commitment to diplomacy with the islamic republic of iran .
europe's high expectations of president obama must now be backed by action .
furthermore , we have grown aware of climate change and have faced financial , economic and energy crises .
for a long time europe and the united states have been allies vital to prosperity , development and globalisation .
europe is extending an open hand to the united states .
member states from the former eastern bloc have a particular debt of gratitude to the united states .
this report consolidates in a very useful document europe's main priorities in its relations with the united states .
i am also pleased that the amendments which I suggested have been included in the report .
first of all , cooperation in the area of security must continue .
es mr president , we ought to shout outgood news !
good news !.
he fundamentally divided european governments , although public opinion not so much .
in conclusion , I would like to add the following reflections .
for example , we are now being asked to provide greater strategic input on afghanistan .
first , the role of legislators in , and the institutional set up of , eu us relations is very important .
we will , therefore , continue to raise this issue .
the report must be readable .
the debate is closed .
this is the main conclusion and motto that can be drawn from this excellent report .
among them , I find people to people contacts to be the true key to lasting relations and cooperation .
it is unacceptable that nationals of five eu member states still face obstacles and need visas to travel to america .
let people interact , researchers cooperate and businesses find joint solutions to the current economic crisis .
the next item is the joint debate on 
this has been on the back burner for a long while , and there is a reason for that .
we would probably then move for a postponement of the vote .
in spite of this , talks should be conducted with this country and the agreement should be signed .
let us remember that certain positive social signs have appeared there .
the recent adoption by turkmenistan of legislation introducing a ban on child labour is one of these signs .
i think it is important that we support the legislation coming out to bring turkmenistan closer to us .
so what is the main problem ?
turkmenistan is in many ways growing in importance .
there are many aspects to the union's relations with turkmenistan .
the fact that turkmenistan borders afghanistan makes it also a strategically important country .
these are all important areas which we need to develop in our own interests .
all this is evidence that turkmenistan is moving ahead .
the only treaty based dialogue consists of a meeting of a joint committee at officials level once a year .
the pca , once in force , would go further by providing for a fully fledged political dialogue .
such agreements already exist in the case of kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan .
it is important for it to be actively neutral in a very tense region that is ripe for destabilisation .
as we all know , central asia could play a very important role where energy security is concerned .
avoid changing language when you speak .
clearly give references to documents .
explain abbreviations that you use in what you say .
monitoring does not mean that we want to sit at the negotiating table .
so , between these two extremes , what should we do ?
we cannot sabotage our own policy by renouncing our values .
so , how should we do this ?
well , we should take two pencils , one in each hand .
i freely admit that the government under president berdymukhamedov has made progress .
that is uncontested .
this was a package deal that was ultimately demanded , but you have said nothing about it .
at the very least a position statement should have been made on this .
i hope that we shall together unanimously document this tomorrow .
that has not been delivered .
the president cut off the speaker 
what has been given as justification for this ?
the justification given was the fact that the absence of an agreement has not produced any results either .
i am nevertheless convinced that policies of suspending relations and isolation in respect of turkmenistan show little promise .
that is not to say that the country's hydrocarbon resources are not important .
journalists and activists are unable to work freely and all opponents are threatened on a daily basis .
so let us avoid being hypocritical , let us make it plain .
the debate concentrated mostly on human rights and that is not surprising for us .
some of us also touched on cooperation with the red cross .
this also applies to turkmenistan .
yes , they are but they are changes and these changes must be acknowledged and they must be encouraged .
so we have to help turkmenistan to help itself .
the commission can make a proposal to that effect .
in addition , technical meetings under the pca , the cooperation committee and the subcommittees , were suspended .
it has taken us much further down the line .
i think that this should be possible within the framework of the current agreements .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
this has been acknowledged by some representatives of civil society in belarus .
however , there have also been incidents which are a cause for our concern .
we are also following closely complaints from the opposition overforcible conscriptionto the army .
these were the considerations which lay behind our decision on 16 march .
we hope that the dialogue will continue over the coming months .
we remain realistic and do not expect any dramatic changes .
belarus is one of the six eastern partnership countries .
belarus has taken measures that are unquestionably along the lines of more democracy .
but political repression still remains a serious problem in belarus .
the european policy that we want must clearly contribute to greater freedom and openness .
there are a couple more points I would like to add .
my final comment is on a somewhat more personal note .
i think that in this connection we should , however , maintain some kind of dialogue .
we must also be very careful .
these are ways in which belarus can profit from the new policy , after many years of isolation .
that is not in accordance with our rules of procedure .
i would like to remind you that belarus declared itself a republic on 25 march 19five thousand people have gathered in the square .
as for dialogue with belarus , this is necessary , but not at any price .
i would like to remind you that for russian citizens the schengen visa is half this price .
i repeat intervene when citizensrights are violated .
hu european policy on the belarus issue was unambiguous .
many in the eu believe that the success of the eastern partnership depends on belarus as well .
the eu institutions have succeeded in killing off their own set of conditions .
the commission's work over many years has been torn down by a single visit by javier solana .
dialogue must strengthen the democratic forces .
only then does it make sense .
that notwithstanding , visa costs should be reduced .
is it not an affront to those who have been imprisoned again recently and who are still being imprisoned ?
at the same time , the picture is mixed , and I think the debate here confirmed that .
we very much appreciate the interest and active involvement of the european parliament on belarus .
to that end , monitoring is required .
on the issue of visas , the situation is equally clear .
it was a turning point for us and for europe .
that is the hallmark of democracy .
it is something we should value .
i very much believe that the subject of our debate today rises above party politics .
it is about values more important than party differences .
this report will provide the opportunity for further political debate on the need for new eu initiatives .
i am looking forward to the debate .
is the commission providing funding from the europe for citizens instrument ?
how are you supporting the establishment of 23rd august asvictims of totalitarianismday ?
i , myself , am a historian .
it is important that we make clear to them as well the horrors of both regimes .
he voluntarily entered the auschwitz extermination camp to organise the resistance movement and gather information about mass murders .
yesterday in parliament we celebrated the european day of home made ice cream .
it is intolerable and unbearable that in twenty years this has not happened .
it has nothing to do with objective , genuinely independent assessments .
i am not blind of course and under so called communism there was repression , injustice and coercion .
yes , it is necessary to investigate and justly condemn the crimes .
no , we have to deal with , not argue about , the question of dictatorships .
it is not a matter for academic study .
the member then spoke in russian 
for that poem osip mandelstam was sent into exile .
in december 1938 his body was placed in a common grave .
the europe of today should remember the victims of 20th century totalitarian regimes worldwide .
those victims are today the foundation of our memory , the lasting spiritual basis of european democracy .
we want to face up to this problem seriously .
half truths , one sided interpretations and the denial of historical truth weakens europeans .
we can make use of the experience of the european court of human rights .
why ?
the view of a totalitarian regime from the outside is very different from the view from the inside .
you deceive yourselves .
communists have no intention of bowing their heads .
they have defended their ideology even with their lives .
this is important , because the shadows of the past have not disappeared .
this is not very precise .
the inhuman face of communism was leonid brezhnev and his predecessors and successors .
we should make no distinction between these twin criminals that is what they were .
but , minister , your country suffered jan palach lost his life .
don't forget usis what your brave countrymen said .
this evening , commissioner , we do not forget those who suffered .
applause 
i never forgot , even when I was young , the suffering that people were experiencing under communist dictatorship .
this was not an obstacle to my being an anti franco fighter and condemning the franco system .
we must not downplay the significance of these crimes , and we must not deny them .
the remainder represented democratic systems .
no such system has the right to exist .
madam president , there is a further dimension to this debate .
madam president , europe has a turbulent history with regard to totalitarianism and the restriction of basic freedoms .
the hungarians in romania , the people I represent , are such a case .
that person still feels , even when just walking down the street , that he is no longer alive .
opportunism is most evident when gross crimes against humanity committed during the last century are neglected .
but there is no reason to stay limited of mind and fearful forever .
why is it important to have such a platform at the european level ?
it is important as an instrument against forgetting .
this is also a chance to combat the relativisation of past crimes .
hitler and stalin are two of a kind .
there are many different kinds of fanaticism .
this debate is just one step but other matters will follow .
we must remember this .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 142 
however , the problem in bulgaria of vote buying indicates the exact opposite .
this is not a matter of celebrating the sufferings of millions of people .
strengthening security and fundamental freedoms on the internet debate 
does the fact that I visit these websites mean that I consent to my society going back 40 years ?
it is feasible .
we are strongly committed to promoting the high standards of protection which eu citizens enjoy at present .
let me conclude with a general comment .
it is , therefore , in the spirit of cooperation that the commission welcomes and supports this report .
the section on the applications of the technology monitoring internet traffic , for example is very important .
let us work on that with the ip enforcement directive and highlight these points in that directive .
it is a new arena for the exchange of opinions that is sorely needed for political mobilisation .
it has brought about increased knowledge .
who decides what constitute controversial political beliefs ?
the right of internet users to be able to delete permanently personal data found on websites is also important .
other groups have also been affected .
the sex industry today uses the internet and the sexual violence that many women and children suffer .
these restrictions have resulted in a security risk for citizens .
the security services of various countries have traded the personal data that they have obtained by monitoring the internet .
i urge you to give great backing to this report tomorrow .
i appeal to manufacturers to respond to our suggestion .
i truly hope that we can achieve this with the cooperation of the industry .
i wish to extend my congratulations to mr lambrinidis and the whole team who contributed to producing this report .
i wish briefly to pick out a couple of points .
i have brought along a book , which is the treaty establishing a constitution for europe .
i believe that the charter brings together the principles set out by mr lambrinidis in his report .
this right is recognised by article ii 71 of the treaty establishing a constitution for europe .
i therefore believe that the lambrinidis report covers these concerns .
i therefore call on you , ladies and gentlemen , to endorse my amendments 2 to that is not how things stand today , but we hope that one day it will be .
i , for one , no longer can .
i come from estonia , which is a world leader in internet availability .
bg ladies and gentlemen , the content of this report fully lives up to its title .
these terms are often infiltrated by slang , cynicism and even vulgarity .
some of these problems require new technical solutions .
rapporteur . mr president , I would like to thank the commission .
but I have the impression that they are fighting a battle on the wrong report .
let me read , in particular , how balanced we have attempted to be with this report .
the amendments , however , are anything but balanced .
this reference in the report does not talk aboutcriminalspeech .
i know it is not easy .
thank you , colleagues .
the vote will take place on thursday , 26 march 200written statements rule 142 
i believe the internet has enhanced europeanslives in countless ways .
we spoke during the last part session on the need to tackle child pornography .
it is a first substantive and important step .
we are also exchanging views with team sports .
i intend to follow up on these discussions by convening a further meeting at this high level in june .
the political debate on sport in europe often attributes great importance to the so calledeuropean sport model.
the european ministers for sport repeated the request to the commission in biarritz .
it is time we heard from the commission itself whether it has yet started to develop these guidelines .
dynamic changes in society are being accompanied by changes in sport .
there is a clear link with the question tabled by mrs batzeli .
what everyone is asking about is legal certainty .
many of these governing bodies believe that it will recognise concretely their specificity , the specificity of sport .
so , what is your interpretation of a sporting organisation banning such a practice ?
i look forward to maintaining this approach .
i have said that we can address specific concrete issues theme by theme rather than case by case .
of course it is not an absolute rule but it concerns specific arrangements .
we have spoken to them and have read the papers but there is nothing new there .
in substance we cannot say that we agree with the study .
we agreed to make room for more expertise and for more exchange .
i think that is very beneficial .
it also concerns the level of competence .
we would like to promote an increased legal certainty , which is why we started the process .
i would like to invite you to share this approach because we do not have a better one .
the debate is closed .
safe and environmentally sound recycling of ships debate 
these are the very same important measures advocated by the european parliament in last year's resolution .
it is essential that the government of bangladesh duly follow up on the court rulings .
i have already remarked that the efforts of individual states will not suffice .
a global solution to the problem of ship dismantling is still urgently needed .
with regard to last year's resolution , it is important to add the following five points .
fourthly , certification of dismantling yards is to be welcomed .
i would especially like to thank mr blokland .
finally , bangladesh will start developing a national law on ship breaking in line with the basel convention .
now , let me turn to the situation closer to home by answering your questions .
i share your concerns about the serious risks this presents to human health and the environment .
we considered the question of introducing an eu ban on beaching in the impact assessment of our strategy .
this will encourage the ratification by third countries and consequently speed up the entry into force of this convention .
regarding funding , there is no fund or mechanism for the time being .
on this we are agreed .
the directorate general on competition and the commission have gone straight for litigation .
one last point , which is also crucial we do not want fragmentation of the law .
that is also of decisive importance .
i also believe that parliament is adding a new important element which the commission's proposal has omitted .
the report raises in a balanced way the question of access to the information necessary for bringing follow up actions .
what did they say ?
there are good fundamental reasons for citizens and companies to be able to claim damages .
the division of responsibility between the eu institutions and the member states has been ignored .
there is no objective analysis of what is required by the subsidiarity principle .
the principle is quite simply not taken seriously .
there are also many other unclear points and points that are at risk of being completely arbitrary .
this creates legal uncertainty and will result inforum shopping, which will be a real threat .
the information asymmetry is to be reduced by forcing companies to provide information to the plaintiff .
nor do we want any abuse of the various national regulations in the form of forum shopping .
we definitely want to avoid collective claims in europe along the lines of the us model .
we want to advise as emphatically as possible against unjustified claims and we want to promote alternative settlement procedures .
changes in this regard will promote cross border trade .
last but maybe not least what was said about out of court settlements .
absolutely no question .
you spoke earlier of convergence with the work of the directorate general on competition .
i just want to refer briefly to the question of access to the european commission's files .
the debate is closed .
agenda for next sitting see minutes
much controversy has surrounded the legal basis of the programme .
as we know , the council's legal services challenged the opinion of the commission .
the commissioner can count on the support of parliament in this matter .
the programme confirms that the eu feels responsible for its most needy citizens .
often they are people with disabilities , or even children .
you suggest that storage costs should be covered as well .
i hope ministers have used the waiting time constructively .
we need to put this food aid scheme on a permanent footing for the future .
however , these stocks are being progressively eliminated .
we must help those people in europe who cannot cope on their own with poverty and rejection .
there are many such people in the old eu countries and many more in the new .
is it not paradoxical that we give most of the money in agriculture to those whose production is expensive ?
and all of this is cofinanced in the name of universality .
it would be an indictment of europe if people here in europe had to suffer hunger .
unfortunately , this is not the case at the moment in europe and the world .
i also congratulate the commission for proposing that this assistance should come from the agricultural budget .
the commission proposal can and must , however , be improved .
at present in lithuania about 20 % of residents are considered to be living in poverty .
the commission's proposal really does not match economic realities .
madam president , feeding the hungry is a basic precept .
it is time we ended this waste .
it would be very hard to find a better and more nourishing food .
commissioner , can you speak to the commissioner for fisheries on the extension of this scheme to include fish ?
they withdrew from this scheme many years ago .
such liberalisation has always been to the detriment of fragile populations , fragile producers and fragile areas .
seventy nine million people in the european union were affected by poverty and malnutrition in 200aid has great political significance , because it confirms the cohesion of eu action on behalf of its citizens .
i congratulate mr siekierski on an excellent report .
however , we must ensure a clear allocation of responsibilities .
european agricultural policy is currently facing , and will in future face , great challenges .
the problem , mr stevenson , is that successive common agricultural policy reforms have been greatly reducing the stocks .
likewise , it would seem to be a good idea to extend the programme duration to three years .
in warsaw I see a line of people queuing for a bowl of soup every day .
member states have made huge advances in improving the quality of life of their inhabitants .
it is estimated that 43 million eu citizens are at risk of malnutrition that is a shocking figure .
the distribution programme is helping many of these europeans .
there are two things I would like to ask of the european commission .
as a result of the crisis , in the next few years the situation will only get worse .
survival must definitely be given priority over any other investments , which can wait until better times .
member states that have a social system in place in their own country certainly need not use this scheme .
the programme is open .
the debate is closed .
it is to be feared that the present crisis and rising unemployment will increase that alarming number .
collective redress debate 
this is why we need to find a solution in the interests of justice and a healthy european economy .
business would favour adr mechanisms .
this will not simply be a repetition of the four options in the green paper .
why should reputable businesses suffer at the hands of unfair competitors who profit when consumers are not compensated ?
and I stresscompensated.
i have my mobile phone here .
we must work on this and we wish to pursue this matter further in the coming months .
france , sweden and poland have reported similar cases and injuries .
that is the clear position of parliament , as will become apparent in a few minutes .
i know that is one of your most important preoccupations .
respecting constitutional constraints yes .
white paper on damages actions for breach of the ec antitrust rules 
therefore I ask for a vote in favour of this report .
in doing so we will show that the european parliament is close to the people and their problems .
social responsibility of subcontracting undertakings in production chains 
firstly , that a total of 15 proposals have been amended without sending out any message 
we are in the european union , not the soviet union .
applause 
the report has now been approved by the committee after being adopted by a two thirds majority .
i ask you to reject the two alternative resolutions .
the state of transatlantic relations in the aftermath of the us elections 
since we did not get sufficient guarantees , we also support mr caspary's proposal to postpone these votes .
only the final vote shall be postponed , then .
then we shall stop before the final vote .
before the vote on amendment 2
the oral amendment was accepted 
does that mean that it fell and did not come to the vote at all ?
the food should be chosen by member statesauthorities and distributed in cooperation with civil society partners .
i believe that mr tannock wished to speak .
this had the makings of a great report .
i drew up the opinion in the committee on foreign affairs .
therefore , we had to vote against it , I am afraid to say .
mr president , I extend a very affectionate welcome to your parents , who are present here today .
i hope that the commission will comply with our request and submit a directive .
these are not the aims of a social and free europe .
mr president , I welcome this report as a shot across the bows of supermarket giants .
someone , somewhere , is doing very nicely , but it certainly is not the producer .
retail prices are very different from the prices at which producers sell their products .
we have experienced 100 % price regulation and we well remember what a failure it was .
free price setting is the foundation of freedom and democracy and any attempt to restrict it will lead to totalitarianism .
it has also brought extensive modernisation which has provided consumers with better quality products at lower prices .
basically , then , we cannot establish regulation of food prices along these lines over europe as a whole .
we have to remember that we must ensure that we have good , safe , top quality food .
that is the real signal that must be sent out .
the spanish government needs to act .
this is the game that we came here for .
i consider this totally unacceptable .
fi mr president , transatlantic relations are very important for us europeans .
it is a shame that president pöttering does not somehow follow your example in so many ways in this .
sadly , in this house there are many examples of anti american sentiment .
we also do not wish to be obliged to resettle dangerous terrorists from the guantánamo bay detention camp .
therefore , overall , the british conservatives voted in favour of the millán mon report .
that is one of our fundamental rights and freedoms .
mixing agricultural policy with social policy may be commendable , but it gets complicated .
the views that are put forward in this committee simply to get agricultural products on the market are astounding .
the agricultural budget should not be used to implement social policy .
in writing . the eu is india's top foreign investor and biggest trading partner .
in short , information must be available and transparent and international agreements must be respected .
another important aspect is the idea that the benefits of free trade are mutual .
this will only happen if the barriers to trade and investment in these countries are also reduced .
in my opinion it is therefore frankly unacceptable to sign economic agreements of this kind .
in some member states it is already compulsory for clients to bear full social responsibility for all their subcontractors .
farmers generally receive around 8 % of the final retail price .
this is necessary in order to make european agriculture profitable .
in agriculture , we consider this an important point .
with regard to dumping , action should of course be taken by the competition authority .
neither are we in favour of the committee's proposal formarket management measures.
the prerequisites for comparisons between the member states simply do not exist for numerous different reasons .
it is a terrible problem requiring immediate action from the european union .
in each case , proper legal procedures were followed at the time of the purchase .
the resolution adopted should begin to bring concrete solutions to people living in the affected areas in spain .
in response to such charges procedures are slow and sentences handed down do not provide satisfaction to the victims .
in writing . we voted in favour of the report in sympathy with the complainants .
we also recognise that the treaties explicitly exclude any effect on domestic rules governing the system of property ownership .
i voted in favour .
we must tackle these problems together , with determination and creativity .
the transatlantic link remains essential .
on account of this bias , I voted against this report .
this is essential if we are to be equal to the challenges faced by our civilisation .
moreover , the statements and pronouncements by the new us president himself leave no margin for doubt .
in addition , I have specific objections to aspects of the report dealing with eu defence .
the facts prove the opposite , however .
on the other hand , however , it opens up a wide range of criminal activity .
europe's cultural potential must be used strategically .
aspects relating to culture have been regularly considered in the context of these workshops .
also , as mrs pack has already said , there is the whole question of cultural diversity .
although the world is getting smaller and although people come together more , there are still these significant differences .
although we integrate them and they learn our languages , they are still there with their own separate identities .
madam president , regions are an extremely important place for the development of culture .
economic revival always follows the year of cultural events .
i am glad that this subject has been raised .
in 1841 , according to the census list , there were 1 821 shoemakers within the county .
and what are europe's regions ?
these expressions are stated in more detail in my amendment to the resolution under discussion .
these are elements of production and commerce which serve to meet fundamental needs .
maintaining culture is expensive , and our role is to support culture .
regional culture should therefore be supported if only for this reason .
they share their culture with other regions , and in exchange learn about the accomplishments and achievements of others .
i would , however , like to express some general points and reactions .
the regional dimension will of course be fully taken into account in this context .

the report highlights the need for meaningful dialogue on security matters .
the report indicates the advisability of replacing the current agreement with a new and broader one .
such an agreement should cover all aspects of our cooperation and should be legally binding .
such arrangements could lead to mutually beneficial interdependence .
it is considered very important for russia to abide by the commitments of membership before formally being granted membership .
our support for the territorial integrity of georgia is clearly one of them .
we continue to expect russia to behave responsibly and to honour all its commitments .
we should not be discouraged if it only moves slowly at first .
we are grateful to janusz onyszkiewicz for his report and the recommendations made in it .
it needs to be pursued through both political dialogue and joint initiatives .
given that negotiations are ongoing , it would not be appropriate to give you the details here .
time and again tensions have arisen over the strengthening of our role in the neighbourhood we share with russia .
traditionally , europe has been united with russia .
we cannot permit the creation of new spheres of influence in europe .
we cannot accept the status quo , or rather the fait accompli in the caucasus .
many fellow members today rightly emphasise the need for eu unity in relation to russia .
it is very important that a new partnership and cooperation agreement be worked out and concluded .
the socialist group firmly condemns violations of human rights .
we call upon russia to respect the principle of the independence of the written and electronic media .
the russian law on ngos endangers the independent operation of these organisations .
this report does not serve that purpose .
it was for this reason that we voted against it in the committee on foreign affairs .
so our concern is not with the criticism , but with the style .
it is not didacticism that is needed , but justified criticism .
it is not for the european union to be the schoolmaster and give lessons to russia .
elections , as we know , are no exception .
first , there are those who once sympathised with the soviets and whose sentimental attachment to the kremlin continues .
none of these arguments holds water .
lastly , europe today has a population three and a half times the size of russia's .
this approach is proving remarkably successful .
it follows that europe's weakness in its relations with russia is caused by its own naivety and short sightedness .
if nord stream is implemented , the same fate may befall my country , poland .
the eu's policy towards russia must be based on the principles of unity and solidarity .
all in all it is rather like trying to play football with only one goal .
indeed , europe and russia both face the urgent need for resolute action to tackle the crisis .
priority , therefore , should be given to joint efforts to improve the global economic climate .
another example is last week's renewed imbroglio in ukraine .
i have not only been working on incidents but also keeping an open mind as regards the long term strategy .
we have discussed the many problems involving russia .
let us not forget , however , that concluding a partnership agreement also means being partners ourselves .
they need us and we need them .
the report rightly discusses this .
we have condemned russia's invasion of georgia and continue to do so .
nevertheless , with all due respect to the rapporteur , he would do well to press the reset button .
unfortunately , he has yet to fulfil this promise .
we are striving for a pragmatic partnership with russia , and a partnership agreement is in our interest .
therefore , the core element of the agreement must be energy partnership .
this must not , however , permit us to depart from our principles and values .
thank you .
what is more , many member states depend on russia for energy and have significant trade with it .
unfortunately , the russian leaders now seem to view relations with third countries as a zero sum game .
it is therefore particularly important for the eu to speak with one voice .
we cannot agree to such an approach .
these values are often overlooked in russia , though the value of money is invariably recognised .
which one will have more impact on russia's behaviour ?
russia has no compunction in exploiting such situations .
so the real key is how russia sees power .
today president medvedev is playing a full part in the g20 meeting in london .
for my part , I think it is a terrible document .
we cannot .
i hope that the commission will not accept these recommendations .
this is the area of climate change , one that has so far been tackled mostly by scientists .
russia is a gangster state where troublesome political opponents , dissenters and journalists are simply murdered .
personally I do not want the european union to negotiate agreements with anyone on anything .
i must remind you of what I have actually proposed in my amendments .
our relations now are a lot deeper and more wide ranging than they were only a decade ago .
we should also strengthen the early warning mechanism and make it more operative .
we therefore look forward to remaining in a dialogue with you as the negotiations progress .
this is true for us , but it is also true for russia and for many other global partners .
the new agreement with russia should therefore lay down , as we always say , legally binding reciprocal commitments .
my second point is a general one and relates to the actual nature of the talks .
i should like to point out that this report avoids terms such as strategic partnership .
i welcome janusz onyszkiewicz's report on eu russia relations .
this is the only way in which we can guarantee european citizens gas supply security at affordable prices .
we must make progress in settling unresolved conflicts , such as those in transnistria , ossetia and abkhazia .
whether this actually comes about largely depends on the russian side .
nobody will force russia to make such a choice or indeed any other .
if europe departed from its fundamental values , it could no longer be europe .
acting to the detriment of this world would amount to suicide .
the european parliament's role is to provide active input into the nature and content of the agreement .
the report provides a detailed analysis of the main aspects of the relationship between the eu and russia .
the report refers to a range of problems whose solution is particularly important to individual countries .
problems of this nature can only be resolved if the eu adopts a united stance .
it is also a major energy supplier and an important trading partner .
opening of international negotiations in view of adopting an international treaty for the protection of the arctic debate 
only three eu member states have territories within the arctic region .
this is one of the key elements in the communication .
now , why is this so important ?
we share your concern that the arctic region deserves international attention as never ever before .
this involved consultations with all main arctic stakeholders , including both eu and non eu arctic states .
we want to see these conventions fully implemented and , very importantly , adapted to the arctic specificities .
we want a north pole that is clean and above all without troops .
it is people , as you have already said , that distinguish the arctic from the antarctic .
we should build on the work of the arctic council .
at all costs , we have to avoid a retreat into old style sovereignty , territorial claims and intergovernmentalism .
our group will not therefore support the 50 year moratorium .
the european union wants us to meet our objectives of renewable energy .
well , mr president , colleagues , let me tell you that I agree with mrs wallis .
the arctic is not uninhabitable .
it is not an unregulated landmass like the antarctic .
this will and should happen in cooperation with the arctic states and the arctic peoples .
however , I think that the main approach taken by the resolution is a good one .
it is good that the eu is focussing on the arctic region .
firstly , it is quite unrealistic .
we must remember that .
the call for a responsible approach towards the arctic is an sos and an issue of global governance .
i would just like to recall the council's conclusions from december .
strict environmental management and sustainable use of resources , as well as open and equitable access .
the letter stated that the university was unable to offer her the care she needs .
the report we are discussing today touches the heart of our society .
there are many people I should like to thank for their contribution to the report .
many of her suggestions have been incorporated into the text .
not all distinctions are regarded as discrimination , however .
you do not want to see equal treatment legislation full stop .
i would also like to say a very great thank you to commissioner špidla .
people of a different religion should not be discriminated against .
please vote for it .
the committee on culture and education called for amendments and additions in three areas .
the committee on culture and education votes unanimously in favour of the horizontal framework directive .
the list goes on .
very few countries are familiar with the concept of multiple discrimination .
this woman must have the opportunity to lodge a complaint and obtain redress and justice .
in a free europe , everyone must have the freedom to hold their own convictions .
the buitenweg report rides roughshod over these limits in every respect .
this amounts to the most serious attack ever perpetrated against the credibility of this house .
this matter was particularly safe in her hands .
requirements can be laid down that are necessary for the realisation of the school's purpose and fundamental principles .
the essential question is and remains what on earth has this got to do with europe ?
we need this legislation .
you have stated fantasies , you have not stated reasons .
applause 
that is why tomorrow , I hope and believe , you will be defeated .
no one , therefore , can remain indifferent .
however , the concept itself remains so wide and abstract that some clarification would be desirable .
freedom of opinion where does protection against direct and indirect discrimination begin , and where does it end ?
the head teacher banned it because there were children of other religious faiths present .
what concept do you have of humanity ?
if ever there was a subsidiarity issue , this should be it .
the third reason is that the measures within the directive are disproportionate and inadequately balanced .
unfortunately , the text contains provisions which are unacceptable from the perspective of religious doctrine .
paradoxically , the left intends to discriminate in this way .
in fact , it is me being discriminated against simply because I sincerely believe in god .
indeed , if it did , it would be corrected by the council of ministers .
the answer has to beno.
now is the opportunity for the house to do that which is right and just and good .
he will explain better than I the reasons why he has to do so .
this directive defends human dignity .
we are talking about human dignity and it is the same for everyone .
the first question was about the creation of senseless additional bureaucracy .
this is a typically open formulation which is redefined of course in different specific cases .
i think that the same thing will be happening in your countries .
commissioner špidla has commented on this .
nl mr president , I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur .
it was no easy task .
some fellow members seem to be particularly quick to take offence .
ladies and gentlemen , mr barrot will replace mr špidla for the final part of this debate .
i would say that this report is not left or right it is about fundamental rights .
let us support it .
it is practical and it is right .
the important thing is that we manage to come to a decision .
let us not add further exceptions to those that already exist .
the fight against discrimination is of crucial importance , and represents the bedrock of the european union's values .
let me give you two examples of this .
each member state has constantly persisted in improving equal access to those who need it the most .
i have said that anyone who asks questions is the bad guy in this debate .
all the speakers who have vehemently spoken against discrimination have talked about the principle .
once again I would appreciate it if we could not dispute the principle and instead work to combat discrimination .
that is purely and simply what we are doing here .
frankly , this promise has taken too long to be realised .
you did not do so .
what you really want is the rejection of the entire proposal .
you simply do not want it , so do not pretend you have the same ultimate objective .
for example , a great many people have asked what business this is of europe's .
that is not what this is about at all that was a different directive .
this is not about the employment of teachers .
let us please stick to the facts .
these are the very specific points that are mentioned in the report .
we have accommodated you throughout .
the vote will take place on thursday 2 april 200written statements rule 142 
the discrepancy is even greater if we compare the everyday lives of the people affected .
everybody is different , everybody is equal .
discrimination is a serious problem in europe and beyond .
germany , in particular , has already gone far beyond previous stipulations from brussels .
in this regard I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work .
thus a great deal of effort is still required on our part in order to eliminate discrimination in europe .
this can be the case for women , disabled people , or the long term unemployed .
the revision of the european social fund regulation that we will adopt tomorrow will therefore enter into force immediately .
we must enable these people to be reintegrated into the labour market as quickly as possible .
or should I say what will change when we adopt this tomorrow ?
mr president , I should like to thank mrs garcía pérez , mrs jöns and mr angelakas .
these changes will simplify the expenditure justification procedure .
this is indeed a considerable sum .
let us not forget this fact .
this will have an immediate effect and we will definitely see the initial results in the following months .
what needs to be done ?
commissioner , I along with my colleagues am going to make a proposal to you along these lines .
that is our job .
i would like to make that quite clear .
why is there no commission action plan on regional policy ?
however , we shall be re tabling them and requesting a roll call vote .
on behalf of the gue / ngl group . ga 
mr president , I would like to welcome mr angelakasreport today .
we are struggling with an economic emergency .
that is , assisting people who are spending a high proportion of their income on fuel costs .
it is mostly these people on low incomes who will suffer as our economy worsens .
the economic crisis must not deflect any of us from meeting the long term challenge of climate change .
secondly , I welcome the simplification and flexibility introduced in this proposal . this is badly needed anyway .
while this package will not solve all their problems , it will help .
lv thank you , mr president .
where are the european policies ?
this is just one of the many improvements proposed .
a further important change has so far been overlooked and is called for , however .
we must enable better quality and cheaper housing for everyone , not just for those living in social housing .
they enable member states to optimise eu investments as an effective remedy against the ongoing economic crisis .
checking negligible items often costs much more than the items themselves are worth .
by supporting clean technologies we can contribute to the recovery of both the automobile and construction industries .
we need to look at subsidies and various tax incentives .
these figures are shocking and frightening .
i am sorry that amendments to these reports were not approved .
madam president , I would like to thank the rapporteurs .
the advances , in particular , could be paid out in full at the start of may .
of course , additional proposals could have been included in the framework of the recovery plan .
its work has already led to a draft revision of the commission's implementing regulation .
other proposals to amend the general regulation and regulations specific to each fund may follow .
this crisis is actually causing genuinely difficult situations and poverty for european citizens .
that is my first comment .
i believe that you too will help in this direction and the european parliament will be standing by you .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
it is very important that the four main areas of the european social fund's activities remain the same 
this means that we must work together both in europe and the rest of the world .
we must respond now , together .
they deserve wholehearted support and should be implemented as soon as possible .
the same applies to the simplifying provisions .
lastly , again by implication , a reduction in the cost of residential heating to be paid by citizens .
since joining the eu , renewable energy and energy efficiency have become mandatory targets in romania as well .
madam president , infrastructural development is crucial to our economic recovery .
i welcome recent statements by the commission which detail the disbursement of eu funds to address this huge challenge .
the president cut off the speaker 
this is a 3 % reduction compared to the figures for last year .
only 30 % of those surveyed stated that they intended to vote in the elections .
in my country , no debate whatsoever on europe is taking place .
is everyone else simply to stand and watch ?
therefore our responsibility to find a solution to the problems of extreme poverty has increased exponentially .
this morning there was an explosion at the ananiev tiraspol ismail gas pipeline in transnistria .
i hope that this accident will not have any impact on the outcome of the elections .
at the same time , I believe that it is linked to two particularly important factors .
thank you .
the danube must be given a higher priority within the community's policies .
these women in white fearlessly drew attention to human rights abuses in their country .
it concerns me that the vice president of our parliament was also a member of the delegation .
.
as for the competitiveness of the european shipbuilding industry , it is no better than it used to be .
thank you .
no such country name or event ever existed .
this was during the sixth anniversary of the imprisonment of 75 opposition representatives .
during this visit commissioner michel did not meet with the damas de blanco or any other opposition representatives .
it invites all the parties concerned to mobilise their efforts to bring it to an end .
furthermore , libya must assume its responsibilities as regards the readmission of illegal migrants who have crossed its territory .
i know the problem well .
what is more , all this is taking place in broad daylight , documented by journalists .
how many were there ?
hundreds of migrants have taken the route to exile in inhuman and highly dangerous conditions .
why is that ?
you are right , the people who disappeared at sea are not illegal migrants 
fifthly , to put an end to the restrictive visa policy , which is often arbitrary and unfair 
that is the real cause of the deaths off the coast of libya a few days ago .
does that mean that we should give up on negotiating ?
no !
thank you , sarah , for your close cooperation .
these rules will also be applied in a more harmonised way .
i would of course like to thank mr henrik lax and parliament .
this step is urgently needed in a european union with open borders .
we are also pleased that we have achieved most of our objectives .
that is the way you have approached this in its entirety .
we also have the whole issue of appeal .
without our staff , we could never do the job that we do so well .
it will work with the visa information system , for which I was the rapporteur .
mr lax has done a great job .
the council has agreed to the obligation of the member states to cooperate only .
now , in many member states , such a right does not exist .
we are against such a wide introduction of biometrics .
regrettably , however , the visa fee is unchanged at eur the debate is closed .
the member states must therefore develop specific equipment to monitor the tachograph .
this is one example of the problems encountered by drivers and transport companies .
i need not go into detail about the gravity of accidents involving heavy goods vehicles .
finally , a brief example of the absurdity of the current regulation on driving time and rest periods .
what is more , it took six hours to settle the fine .
thousands of vehicles are standing idle because there are no jobs for them .
the same applies to drivers .
i should like to refer in particular to the eurovignette and to the internalisation of external costs .
i would like to give a little reassurance to those who have expressed the concerns of the profession .
vets have a duty of care and will always try to treat a sick animal .
under present legislation they are often forced to resort to unlicensed medicines .
that same year , the cvmp issued a guideline on the establishment of mrls for minor species .
the risk analysis approach for residues of veterinary medicinal products in food of animal origin .
it is also an important component of the commission's legislative simplification programme .
therefore , we now have a common position of not only the council and parliament but also the commission .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
many of us may think that this report is also of this nature .
for this reason , appropriate regulation for the distinctive features of this branch is needed .
the testing is paid for by the company .
i have been concerned about the studies that have been recently published on the children of migrants .
we also need special investment and additional resources for teacher training and the entire educational system .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
the education of migrantschildren is a step in this direction .
this is precisely why we need to support member states in finding solutions .
this is an absolutely crucial issue , therefore .
i am pleased that virtually all the results of the ep report tally with those of the commission report .
written statements rule 142 
for ten years our parliament had not taken up this issue .
it is this dynamic and progressive definition that we are defending today in this sensitive area of electromagnetic waves .
european citizenship does not replace national citizenship .
the scale of migration , however , poses many challenges for the host countries .
nevertheless , instances of discrimination remain .
the second right I mentioned , that of consular protection , is still , unfortunately , poorly applied .
this is unacceptable for european citizens .
the treaty on the european union states that every citizen of the union is equal .
unfortunately , however , this principle is not always fulfilled in reality .
opening of the sitting
the new ecolabel will take on a new guise in terms of its look and content .
the commission set a target of increasing that to 35 000 participants .
that is a very ambitious target . it is almost a 10 fold increase .
so that kind of change is important .
core indicators will also be introduced .
they will see this kind of initiative by the commission as a distraction .
but I think that is wrong .
the regulation is more flexible and able to meet the new environmental challenges and priorities .
given that it is a framework legislative act , the ecolabel regulation does not set specific criteria for products .
i trust that parliament will fully support this positive bundle of proposals .
my thanks once again to the rapporteurs for their excellent work .
however , the text which we are being called to vote on allays my initial fears .
marketing support for this label has been very limited in the past .
i thank all those who have been involved in the work .
i think that reference is very relevant .
this directive takes an important step in the right direction by simplifying the passage toward getting the ecolabel .
it is very important to analyse the whole life cycle of a product , from production to destruction .
the simple fact of the matter is that we use too much on our planet .
we use resources quicker than they are able to replenish themselves .
we have had a long discussion about foodstuffs and I think that we have arrived at a sensible solution .
and the power of one is perhaps something we have not promoted enough .
this enables people to help the environment directly and to reduce emissions in their everyday living and buying .
labelling is a clear and simple measure to promote energy efficiency , ethical production and development of greener technologies .
it also provides means to reduce animal testing and child labour .
ireland and europe can benefit by further promoting and using the scheme .
the other crucial factor is that the label should only be for environmentally superior products .
another important issue in the debate was whether the ecolabel might be extended to food .
the regulation is a first step .
what does environmental sustainability mean for the ecolabel , though ?
all this amounts to nothing less than a revolution .
but on a note of caution the european parliament's control over this will be particularly unbending .
congratulations again to the rapporteur for his excellent report .
this in turn should give the system greater authority by encouraging application on a broader , more global scale .
we must , however , improve communication .
first revision of the emas scheme was not encouraging .
the rapporteur , mrs mcavan , added valuable additional modifications .
it would help organisations to proceed more easily from iso to emas standards .
an impartial system of certification will be , we suppose , appreciated also by consumers .
this is a real improvement .
this declaration also clarifies that the ecolabel will be complementary to the specific fishery products regulation .
i have already suggested to the institution's management to join this scheme as soon as possible .
i also think it is right that we will be retaining the voluntary nature of the scheme in future .
it would be a great shame if the establishment of the ecolabel were to fail due to bureaucratic obstacles .
one symbol , one conclusion that is what we should all be working towards together .
i thank him for preparing the report , and I thank you for listening to me .
for the time being its popularity lags behind the international iso 14001 standard .
in my opinion , both reports contribute to movement in this direction .
this requires unambiguous criteria , of course .
eventually , only the top 10 % to 20 % of products per category can be awarded the ecolabel .
introducing the system will contribute to an improvement in the state of the environment and will counteract climate changes .
it will also contribute to a reduction in water consumption .
if it is in it , it must say so , and what it says must be correct .
we should demonstrate that europe exerts itself on specific concerns and delivers exceptionally well on them .
the commission and member states must ensure that the necessary funds are earmarked for ecolabel awareness and promotion campaigns .
if we want this scheme to be effective it must not be accompanied by an increase in red tape .
thank you .
the third statement concerns the commission's plan to re examine the level of duty on ecolabel products .
i should therefore like to stress once again the importance of reaching agreement at first reading .
numerous useful changes have been made to the texts and the results are very balanced .
i therefore call on you to support this text in its entirety without further change .
2 in relation to coherence with chemicals legislation
that is a job for next time .
i look forward to the vote , which I hope will be a very simple , straightforward one .
the debate is closed .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting see minutes
thank you very much .
parliament's will is always decisive .
we will consider what you had to say in the next meeting of the bureau .
we will take care of this matter .
on behalf of the whole of parliament , I wish the delegation a very warm welcome !

applause 
i would therefore be grateful for a postponement .
member of the commission . we do not object to the postponement .
bi annual evaluation of the eu belarus dialogue vote 
i would not like to delete the truth now .
interjection from the floor 
pl mr president , I would just like to add that I also signed the resolution .
i would therefore ask you to add my name .
opening of international negotiations in view of adopting an international treaty for the protection of the arctic vote 
i do so on foot of what commissioner ferrero waldner said here last night in the debate .
applause 
health concerns associated with electromagnetic fields 
better schools an agenda for european cooperation 
the next item is voting time .
our education systems should not have to be adapted to the cultures of other peoples .
it will not surprise you to learn that I am resolutely in favour of the first of these arrangements .
in fact , european citizenship is highly artificial in nature .
the rapporteur regrets above all that the citizens are unaware of the rights that it would give them .
it should not be diverted and it should not be shared .
i reject that philosophy as I reject the lisbon treaty .
mr president , I am not , first and foremost , a european union citizen .
but I have no difficulty with the wordssubjectsandcitizens.
focusing on cohesion policy is a sensible way for us to fulfil our obligation to communities and economies .
i will give poland as an example .
first of all , we all accept some discrimination .
i support that .
of course we are all against discrimination .
it is right that we correct that anomaly .
above all , it bears witness to exceptional levels of distrust in respect of the member states themselves .
anti discrimination legislation of this kind is not a refinement of the principle of equality under the law .
i will mention two examples .
for that reason I voted against mrs buitenweg's report today .
i do not believe there is any need for european legislation in these matters .
the document breaches the principle of subsidiarity , which is becoming an increasingly common practice in the european parliament .
actually , it is the most we can do in this house together in the name of justice .
we owe our parents and grandparents a firm parliamentary message , and that is what we have produced today .
it is here , my friends , that you make your bloomer .
now of course , one has to be careful making such parallels .
there were two interesting sentences in the report that merit further attention .
we should be careful it is not the first step towards totalitarianism .
unfortunately it also imprisoned history and its documents .
millions of pages of history have been kept hidden in the secret archives that still exist in moscow .
however , we believe that majority decisions by parliament are not competent to interpret historic facts .
the evaluation of historic facts is the job of historians and historians alone .
my friends , culture cannot be created by bureaucratic fiat .
it is time for action .
those steps undermine the territorial integrity of georgia as insisted upon in the relevant united nations resolutions .
i have voted in favour of mr varvitsiotis's report on the mutual recognition to decisions on supervision measures .
this is the first and a fundamental step towards full integration into society .
the integration of migrants , whether residing legally or illegally , is a priority for us socialists .
that is simply contrary to the international conventions .
i think the answer lies in the paragraph quoted above .
i can only admire the opportunistic hypocrisy of my tory colleagues .
we believe that actions should be taken to assist all vulnerable pupils .
concentrations of foreigners of 20 , 50 or even 90 % show that the multicultural vision has failed .
many children of romanian immigrants , for instance , face difficulties in this respect .
at this very moment , romania , for example , is going through an experience which reflects this .
it is typical and unacceptable that the report refers solely to the children of legal immigrants .
we do not accept the hierarchy that the parliamentary right wishes to create amongst migrants .
mother and father are the most important people for a child .
we share the report's overarching idea of improved european citizenship and improved freedom of movement .
for example , the ep 
this is a serious attack on national identity and cohesion .
their objective is to lead the workers , especially young people , up an ideological garden path .
the workers can and will send this message through the ballot box during the european elections in june .
i decided to vote against mrs gacek's report on problems and prospects concerning european citizenship .
i agree with the aim , but not with the methods .
i would tackle the root of the problem , which actually lies in other matters .
interventions should target low income households , as defined by the national legislation in force .
the mass legalisations of recent decades also cast doubt on whether it is sensible to proceed with harmonisation .
this will facilitate movement of citizens and also of workers between countries both within and without the community .
i voted in favour of mr tatarella's report on a community ecolabel scheme .
emas was first introduced in 1995 and was extended in 2001 to both public and private sector organisations .
combating discrimination of all kinds and bringing about participation in public life by the disabled are important jobs .
we therefore voted against this report .
i do not think so .
then the principle of equality may as well be done away with completely .
i was pleased to support it .
it has broad support from social platforms and civil society .
matters of marital or family status
the secular nature of the state and its institutions
i therefore welcome this report , which urges a further strengthening of provisions to enforce such equality .
we rightly have restrictions on freedom of speech covered by the laws of libel and slander .
the pitfalls in such a coercive regulation are legion .
in the name of equality , the censors and the dictators are here present .
the reality of daily life shows that much progress remains to be made in the member states .
the offensive remarks about the elderly that continue unabated are an eloquent illustration of this .
however , I am unable to subscribe to the pathways and options described in this report .
however , legislation in this area must be well thought out .
the cda is opposed to the proposal to reverse the burden of proof .
i have met with and been lobbied by many disability interest groups who asked for consideration of their position .
at council many member states have also voiced concerns about the proposal .
this amendment was rejected by the house and therefore I abstained in the final vote .
in such cases my party , the dutch socialist party , objects .
discrimination on the basis of ethnic or racial origin is forbidden both in the labour market and outside it .
the lobby made a hostage of genuine discrimination when it added sexual orientation and religion or belief .
these forms of discrimination have never been defined in any eu documents .
the consequences may be dramatic .
non discrimination based on belief is also problematic .
insurance premiums will become more expensive .
it is far too early to be entering into any kind of normal dialogue with belarus .
would any of the eu countries agree to such conditions ?
they must not be held ashostagesby the authorities .
i refuse to create a hierarchy of suffering .
we did vote in favour of the resolution as a whole , however .
we condemn the atrocities of both nazism and stalinism .
to others , it was about maintaining traditions , inequality , positions of power and privileges .
nobody remembers their causes , but everyone remembers their means .
that era must absolutely remain in the past .
even though I do not agree with the wording in places , I think this resolution is essential .
this is an important element in our history .
every ideology which does not respect human dignity and human life deserves condemnation and is fundamentally unacceptable .
nazism and communism are ideologies that were actually inspired by older ideologies .
we must particularly emphasise this at the current time , which is an uncertain and exceptionally difficult period .
this resolution discusses issues which lie outside the european union's competence .
consequently , we voted against this report .
we have common interests like fighting nuclear proliferation and building peace in the middle east .
the state of democracy and the rule of law in russia remains of concern .
our partnership with russia must therefore be strong and durable , but it cannot be unconditional .
for our part , we reject this type of relationship out of hand .
i therefore believe that both parties must make more effort to achieve this aim .
however we cannot allow russia to bully its neighbours and use its hydrocarbon resources as a diplomatic weapon .
the waiting lists of maltese and gozitans in need of medical tests and surgical interventions are unbelievable .
2 per cent of the population is waiting for cataract operations .
the 1999 recommendation requires an update within five years of it being published that takes into account ongoing research .
no update has taken place .
due to the ever changing nature of this field , we need to re evaluate the regulations protecting our citizens .
i voted in favour of mrs ries's report on health concerns associated with electromagnetic fields .
member states are responsible for the organisation , content and reform of school education.
that much I agree with .
i vote in favour of a slimmer but more focused eu .
in writing . I voted in favour of the schmitt report on better schools .
this common diagnosis is necessary , if only because of the huge migration taking place within the community .
it is a solid foundation .
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
it is therefore with a twinge of sorrow that I declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .
up to 40 000 people were made homeless by the main quake and numerous aftershocks .
i would ask you to rise from your seats in silent remembrance .

it is finally time to take a decision .
wednesday 
on behalf of all the signatories , I call for this situation to be remedied .
have I now suddenly come up against another sort of earthquake ?
mrs lulling , the president does not make this decision alone , I follow the rules of procedure .
the decisive factor is rule 132 , by which we are bound .
the next item is the one minute speeches on matters of political importance .
the multilateral trade finance package adopted in london by g20 is without doubt a positive move .
over 20 people , including children , were burned alive in a building .
there was no kidnapping , either on 9 april or ever .
this industrial action brought very serious disruptions to flows of freight through this vital trans european route .
any lenience on our part would cast a shadow over eu credibility in this respect .
again , eu credibility and authority are at stake .
sometimes things seem different here .
i only heard the last 10 words .
mr president , after 36 years of membership , what has the european union meant for britain ?
eu membership is a disaster for britain .
de mr president , yesterday the united nationsanti racism conference opened in geneva .
this shows the unity of the european union in relation to such an important event in a poor light .
france is also approaching this proportion .
more than a third of the members of the german government are women .
in fact , 30 % have no intention of participating in the forthcoming elections .
the millions that have been spent on communications with the citizens have been to no avail .
what is particularly frustrating for me is that the promised election awareness advertisement has spectacularly backfired .
this needs to be visible and easily understood .
any power which is afraid of the press will first strike against them .
it is time for us to take stock of the situation .
an eu backed report has recently concluded that up to 125 million citizens are affected by energy poverty .
let me first emphasise the increased forms of accountability that we have negotiated .
finally , we have introduced requirements for streamlined decision taking .
regarding the overall package , as it has been negotiated , parliament can be proud of the final text .
moreover , an a class tyre is more cost effective in the long run .
this corresponds to removing the co2 emission from near enough one million passenger cars on european roads .
i should like to conclude with a word about the time frame .
the tool to achieve this goal is the third internal energy market package for gas and electricity .
today we are close to the adoption of this package and thus to achieving this goal .
the commission fully supports this compromise .
the compromise reached also strikes a good balance between the positions of parliament and the council .
a lot of companies have restructured their business and how they deal with networks and consumers .
the discussions and proposals demonstrate that parliament shares the policy objectives and wishes to vigorously improve current performance .
it is important that we find the best way of displaying the label .
there is some discussion on this .
i would like to thank all those involved and particularly all members of the european parliament that supported this .
madam president , thank you mr piebalgs for your focussed speech .
but that would hinder and damage all the things that we can achieve by an open electricity market .
fortunately , however , summing this third package up as ownership unbundling would be a mistake .
this will be a cartel , and to face this cartel we need stricter laws .
this is very important for small eu member states .
not everything concerning the agency for the cooperation of energy regulators was brought to a conclusion .
for example , the issue of its headquarters remains open .
we did not agree as to the instruments with which we can best achieve this .
which sources of energy will best limit the greenhouse effect and reduce the costs of its control ?
we were faced with two important problems .
secondly , the principle of open competition in the european energy market .
the revival of the energy performance of buildings sector , except for a striking reduction ..
we have a lot of work ahead of us .
energy poverty has become a serious issue .
for that reason we are making energy a public service with this legislative package .
let us make further headway along this route .
legislation such as this will ensure our manufacturers become world leaders in the technology we so urgently need .
tyres are not cheap , yet most individual buyers are forced into uniform purchases .
this information will help make the move towards goods that reduce emissions as well as noise pollution .
i am pleased that we have reached agreement on this extensive and professionally demanding dossier .
a key task is to increase the generating capacity of european power stations and develop the cross border network .
de madam president , commissioner , I would like to congratulate you on this package in particular .
there is no ideal legislation .
we can be really proud of it .
rapporteur . madam president , I would like to thank colleagues once again for their cooperation .
it is far from perfect but it is definitely a step forward .
but there is a huge amount more to do .
what we have at the moment is the worst of both worlds .
i would like to pick up one or two points that have come up in the debate .
should we come back for a fourth package ?
market forces are already moving in this direction .
that is why it is a good thing to do .
the debate is closed .
today nearly 100 million people live in prefabricated buildings .
money should be found for this purpose as part of the mid term review of the 2007 2013 financial framework .
however , the market price of energy is only one side of the problem .
there is a significant , additional financial burden on consumers due to energy market inefficiencies and distortions .
better standard of transparency and rationality governing price increases as well as better access and information regarding consumer rights .
at the same time , I welcome that the council's compromise reflects parliament's numerous consumer protection proposals .
planners and building inspectors will receive appropriate guidance from this directive .
the targets for buildings with zero net energy consumption constitute a significant part of the reworked directive .
that option is now extended to all member states .
we , the european community , have set ourselves a very ambitious task .
in saying this , I would like to express my support for the rapporteur .
finally , it is important for workers abroad wanting to hear their children's voice on the phone .
the only option for consumers is to choose not to communicate by mobile phone .
furthermore , in some countries the cost of installing and operating mobile phone networks is higher .
this is why the regulation stipulates that the european commission must analyse different means of regulating the market .
we have made guidelines more transparent on advising customers about roaming mobile internet access .
we have reduced the maximum tariffs for calls received and made , while maintaining a profit margin for operators .
that is why I thank the european parliament for having so swiftly responded to the commission's proposal .
we now have an average penetration rate in europe of 119 % .
it also gives good money to the industry because their traffic is rising continuously .
now we are going a step further firstly , of course , on voice roaming .
the value of the revenue from this for the industry is roughly eur 800 million .
and for data roaming , where we believe that this is a future development .
i think the people outside will understand that this parliament works for the citizen .
i am pleased that we did not have any differing points of view on this occasion .
in fact , we have all quickly adopted this tariff reduction .
citizens should , therefore , have extensive and easy access to telecommunications services .
in this regard I value highly the work of the commission and the commissioner .
this is important , because this matter in large measure concerns the youngest group in our society .
pl mr president , commissioner , I am pleased with the direction in which we are moving .
i am referring to the radical price reductions in voice roaming calls and internet access .
this is the first step , and I think that others will follow .
this news will certainly be received gladly .
i would like to thank the commission .
it is a great moment which shows to citizens that meps are taking them seriously .
how we should regulate it is a matter which we can still discuss .
i would like to say a final word to this industry as a whole .
we must not allow the perception to be conveyed that the mobile phone sector ruthlessly exploits consumers .
it had limited resources with which to tackle the scale of the task to be accomplished .
another very important matter is the difference between words and deeds when preparing agreements .
drawing up and signing cause a great deal of ambiguity .
finally , I would like to thank the commissioner for his cooperation during this term of office .
the next speaker will be mr fjellner .
mr president , I am impressed that you at least attempted to list all of these decentralised agencies .
in 2007 , the budget for all the agencies was eur 1 243 500 000 .
staff numbers have increased just as dramatically .
in 1995 , 38 people , on average , worked in each agency .
therefore we are not yet able to grant it discharge .
we need to have all the information on the table before we can grant discharge .
in the draft resolution before you paragraph 58 , the rapporteur .
so there was too much carrot and too little stick initially .
we have also pursued evolution rather than revolution .
obviously , five years for our action plan was not enough .
but your question is ,how and when can you guarantee a positive das ? 
first , I should remind honourable members what the so callednegative dasis .
so we must do something to end this damaging political assessment of the use of european funds .
for urgent , more guaranteed results , one could imagine three options 
we contacted several national delegations they all agreed nobody acted .
there are millions of transactions to check .
it means reducing the number of transactions from millions to a few thousand .
this is the discussion about tolerable risk .
the council also now seems ready to engage .
the eu was created to bring peace and prosperity .
but audit perfection is a rare phenomenon anywhere in the world .
in general we think that there is visible progress and we are going to support granting the commission discharge .
cooperation and communication are important tools and we often witness the results of omissions in this respect .
we will continue the discussion .
the image conveyed to citizens by our parliament and by the european union in general is very important .
we need to manage crises on our own and not to transfer this ability to other bodies .
it is unfortunate that these came at the end of the period .
it is very harmful to public opinion if the situation of a negative das is sustained year after year .
the committee's excellent reports clearly reveal the serious shortcomings that exist .
allow me to quote from one of these reports .
the eu member states must finance themselves and not tax their neighbours .
what is now happening to this voluntary pension fund has been thrown out by the eurosceptics .
what is happening is unethical and we have to take action against it .
the european development fund enables us to combat poverty , while promoting economic development and democracy .
so thank you all for this contribution to the complicated discharge machinery .
the member states are responsible because they are not applying the regulations with enough rigour .
parliament is responsible because it must be clear about the current imperfections and must accept the reforms .
however , there is something , mr president , that I do not understand .
mr ferber has already mentioned this point .
we need the cooperation and constructive ideas that we have developed over recent years .
we established a statute for assistants and we were also criticised for this .
we need a european model .
i am very pleased to be chairman of this committee .
the vote will take place on thursday 23 april 200written statements rule 142 
the agency for fundamental rights ,
de facto , their transposition into binding community legislation would bring legal certainty .
moreover , close cooperation with the international atomic energy agency has ensured consistency with international practices .
it has absolutely nothing to deliver in this regard .
we have a duty to do that .
i repeat we demand transparency , and we want clear and rigorous legislation .
i am grateful to our rapporteur , mr hökmark .
it was not easy to achieve this .
we also worked together with the council , which had discussed more or less the same proposals in 200it is the national regulators who are responsible for the safety of the installations running in their countries .
in my view , it is important that we can lay the ground for having more nuclear power plants .
in writing . I would like to draw my attention to the environmental situation of marsaxloqq bay .
this has had a health impact on the residents in its region especially those of marsaxloqq .
deforestation has now become a major issue at international negotiations , on both climate change and biodiversity .
this proposal is already being discussed and processed at the international negotiations on climate change currently under way .
the proposed measures include the following 
these undertakings will also be implemented through the european commission's policy on sustainable consumption and production .
the core element of the above action plan was the conclusion of voluntary partnership agreements with third country timber producers .
we believe that the agreements in question may help to address the basic causes of illegal logging .
this ban was included in the options examined by the commission when it drafted its proposal .
however , while this approach is quite attractive at first sight , it presents important practical and political difficulties .
sadly , however , the painfully slow rate of progress in the council has put paid to that idea .
this means that the european union must assume a leading role in formulating a global political response .
part of the auction revenues resulting from the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions must be earmarked for halting deforestation .
the illegal logging regulation does not aim to punish or to hinder trade but rather to better control trade .
it is true that the commission proposals were not really clear on how the system should work in practice .
it is important to underline that tackling global deforestation and forest degradation is a complex issue .
i wish to thank again ms lucas , mr ford and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent work .
i think it is much more sensible that everybody has a role to play .
i would also add that many elements of our proposals are actually supported by industry .
the joint debate is closed .
in fact , the commission has condemned this situation recently .
under the cfp , control and enforcement are the exclusive competence of the member states .
it will also facilitate cross checking of data and information , and the identification of risks .
on transhipments of stocks subject to multiannual plans , amendment 42 deletes the entire article amendment 47 deletes the entire section on real time closure of fisheries .
real time closures are directly linked to control issues .
therefore , this amendment cannot be accepted .
in the same vein , amendment 61 cannot be accepted .
to introduce such a rule additionally in the context of the penalty point system would be disproportionate .
by not providing an official , the member state concerned could even prevent an autonomous inspection from taking place .
this would seriously undermine the capacity of the commission to apply this measure .
evidenceof non respect will be much harder to prove thanreason to believe.
in the same vein , the commission cannot accept amendment 113 , which proposes to delete this article .
amendments 74 to 78 reduce substantially the pressure on member states to respect national quotas .
this report is a significant contribution to a truly efficient control system .
i mention here article 47 of the control regulation , at least in its original version .
there are over one million of us in britain we are conservation minded we are sensible .
if you get this power , you can come back year after year .
we should be recognising as the americans have done the enormous economic impact that it can have .
we have regulated their fishing since 1983 , so for 26 years .
what is more , it is still not working .
that is the path , mr president , that brussels must also take .
we do not need this at the centre of it .
on article 47 , recreational fishing , I welcome the definition , which was missing in the draft proposal .
it must be the exception and not the rule .
get the balance right , please , commissioner borg .
pt mr president , commissioner , your proposal is absolutely fundamental .
however , I should also like to say that I am in favour of subsidiarity .
clearly we are equally strongly aware of the need for a meaningful reform of our control systems .
i said that we are prepared to accept the definition that is proposed in one of the amendments .
we have a significant problem with recovery stock .
interjection from the floor no science for that at all !
i myself took part in such a conference in scotland some time ago .
this is the reason why there is no general exemption for this fleet in the proposal .
taking the margin of tolerance as an example , I agree with the commission that 5 % was sufficient .
i believe that it was indeed vitally urgent to simplify the legislative framework in this respect .
you were always available for us .
it has been much appreciated and noted and the comparison made with other commissionersavailability .
in my view , this is a matter of interest and one that should be debated .
we are more restrictive than you tend to be .
the debate is closed .
rather , it wants a coherent one , because only a coherent policy can be effective .
common sense prevailed over intransigence and respect for the law reigned over the law of the jungle .
this was not something I could accept .
next month , the commission will propose means by which the implementation of this pact can be monitored .
this will take place through an annual report that will be issued by the commission .
in various parts the busuttil report urges the commission to take action .
according to eurostat , population ageing in the eu will become a reality in the medium term .
immigration could act as an important stimulus to ensure good economic performance in the eu .
illegal work needs to be tackled given that it fundamentally violates the rights of migrant workers .
bad management of migration may have serious consequences for the countries of origin and for the immigrants themselves .
allow me to elaborate on some of the issues raised in the report .
civil society organisations are now more actively involved in the development and the initiation of projects .
the vote will take place on wednesday 22 april 200effective enforcement of judgments in the eu the transparency of debtorsassets short presentation 
small businesses are affected disproportionately by people defaulting on payments .
thanks must also go to colleagues from other groups who have made very constructive suggestions .
what is key , I believe , is for this legislation to be brought forward as soon as possible .
i would also like to thank ms gill for the report .
furthermore , this is key for the survival of small businesses in the current economic climate .
the item is closed .
this committee that I sit on is a peculiar committee of parliament .
we have called for the commission to take action in this regard .
i think that is extremely important .
in recent years women's dignity and calling have taken on a new dimension .
at the general directorate level the representation of women is still insufficient .
i would especially like to thank my fellow members on the various committees who were responsible for this work .
the model is described in detail in the explanatory statement .
gender equality is one of the basic principles of community law .
women represent 52 % of the european population .
it has adopted many reports and opinions which deserve more attention from the other committees in parliament .
for this reason too the numbers of women meps should increase a one third to a half .
nowadays , there is an ever increasing number of women becoming involved in politics and making major decisions in companies .
this has been ignored in the past .
this relates to software rather than hardware .
it now needs to be adjusted to new challenges .
the item is closed .
the final stage of integrating the network should place greater emphasis on the financing of its cross border elements .
agenda for next sitting see minutes
the recent conclusions of the g20 have further strengthened this determination .
such an initiative is all the more important now during the period of crisis we are going through .
it is , of course , something which we are coming back to .
i will just finish on this one note .
these will be discussed by the heads of state or government in june .
the situation in the eu financial sector is serious .
all g20 members have agreed on regulating credit rating agencies through the introduction of mandatory registration and oversight regime .
however , I also have to admit that I am disappointed with certain aspects of the compromise .
i now turn to the weber report .
ten times , I repeat .
in the current difficult and challenging economic situation we cannot afford such impediments .
this is not 193we did not have the institutions or the capability of addressing things that we have now .
i do not see this coming from the european council and it is time it did .
the outcome of this kind of self regulation is clear for all to see , and it is terrible .
now is the time to take courage and build a new structure for the financial markets .
one good thing is that there is to be only one rating category .
there are no comparable rules in any other eu regulation .
what to do with this enormous debt that has built up by granting credit without guarantees ?
speeches about action do not guarantee that the action will be effective .
we do not agree with the compromise that is proposed and that rejects the system of group supervision .
we believe this to be irresponsible .
time will tell whether member statessupervisory authorities have sufficient capacity to understand these models .
nobody understands it least of all the fsa .
frankly , I think you are going to get on really well with each other .
madam president , I am pleased that solvency ii has at last reached the point of decision .
i am glad the scope is restricted to ratings used for regulatory purposes .
the president cut off the speaker 
to prevent any further crisis , we obviously need to be much more ambitious and more pro active .
that is all for now .
the fall out of all of this for workers and families across europe has been nothing short of catastrophic .
when the risks become reality , the management have got their money and the losses are borne by others .
rating agencies know that they will not get the work if they question the solvency of their clients .
we are spurred on by the need to adopt joint european responses and take a global lead .
another stage is being completed , and further chapters must be tackled or completed without delay .
the banking directive is due for adoption in may .
nevertheless the g20 found ideal culprits tax havens , whether real or not .
the g20 intends to regulate only speculative funds that pose a systemic risk .
solvency ii was long overdue I wish to start by setting this aside .
what mr gauzès has now negotiated is useful .
first of all , there is no point in trying to solve yesterday's problems .
this is exactly why we have introduced such a process in the lamfalussy procedure , which we developed recently .
secondly , we should consider the level that is under scrutiny .
as it happens , the rating agencies allowed for this .
this also means that these guest supervisors refuse to transfer powers to supervisors who play first fiddle .
we need greater openness and transparency on the market , greater opportunities to act across borders and improved supervision .
however , we must take care not to over regulate , which is a risk in the current mood .
let us not forget that the market economy creates prosperity .
from the sale of 400 tonnes of gold ?
so europe is reacting , albeit slowly , but better late than never .
this , of course , leaves two major questions which need to be answered .
but I would like to point out two pitfalls here .
for this reason , I support the measures , even though we will have to go further .
parliament will monitor and promote its development .
the de larosière group report and the turner report , too , have made this quite clear .
these reports are in analytical tune with the lamfalussy follow up report of parliament .
de madam president , three brief points are important in my eyes .
what have you been doing since then , commissioner ?
of course , this is not the end of the story .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , I shall limit myself to two or three brief remarks .
certainly , but let us vote on this and work in the right direction .
i have to say that without their work and their help , we would not have achieved this .
let us hope that we can get that back .
capital is defined as well .
my second point is about the strategic impact of using such legislation .
the joint debate is closed .
i do not wish to discuss here the importance of rating agencies .
we need new organisations in this sector , which will generate competition in providing objective ratings .
we must think about protection for the investors and their confidence in rating agencies .
the eu must guarantee that rating agencies operate according to clear regulations .
the next item is the joint debate on 
generally speaking , the commission carries out this work in harmony with the imf .
member of the commission . I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague , mr almunia .
the council has announced that it will not be making a statement .
this topic is being tabled for discussion for a second time within a short period .
how did such an immoral action occur to you , together with the spineless hungarian government ?
thank you .
yes , mr mccreevy , please ?
please ?
as you know , the procedure comprises two stages .
this means we have a dual instrument .
europe has contributed to increasing this funding whilst also assuming its own responsibility .
therefore , the limit of eur 50 billion is completely justifiable at present .
if new challenges should present themselves , we shall not be able to close our eyes to them .
this will be less expensive and will give the european union greater stability .
we will become victims of the crisis if we are unable to take quick , effective action .
this applies to my country , hungary , and to every other country too .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on friday 24 april .
agreement between the ec and pakistan on certain aspects of air services 
trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products 
coordination of social security systems 
rapporteur . nl I can be very brief .
we discussed the first reading of this dossier less than a year ago .
we managed to work well with the european commission .
i should like to leave it there .
this is the regulation to which that refers , and this is the implementation of it .
this will introduce substantial europeanisation into the important field of measurement .
each amounts to eur 200 million , and this will enable us to achieve cooperation between the nation states .
so , then , I wish to reiterate my particular thanks to everyone involved .

in the commission's view , these measures could also include the suspension of the agreements .
the latter is a fundamental principle for trade agreements made by the european union .
that was all that could be hoped for .
common immigration policy for europe principles , actions and tools 
green paper on the future of ten t policy 
i am particularly pleased that we are joined by czech minister for foreign affairs , mr karel schwarzenberg .
the time for protectionism is over .
this is what we should also be aiming for in the case of tyres .
in this matter we need to find the right sort of balance .
that would be in the interests of the public .
the level for regular roamers is much lower .
this is , in other words , a tax on non travellers for the benefit of travellers .
who has the power , and over whom does he wield it ?
i would also like to point out that these roaming tariffs have been very unclear .
this european approved response is a good example of a closer relationship on financial cooperation .
but it is good to have him in the centurion club .
i voted for the hökmark report for all sorts of reasons .
mainly because , well , who could be against nuclear safety ?
i am therefore glad that , today , amendment 48 has been approved .
it is a shame no one from the council is here to answer that question .
this is something we do not agree with , and we also voted against it at committee level .
the tools ?
what is europe to do ?
europe must wake up and regulate immigration flows seriously we cannot go on like this !
the current regulation , which this report also regulates , is not sufficient to protect coastal fishing .
in writing . it I am voting in favour .
i was the draftsman for the opinion of the international trade committee which was adopted unanimously in committee .
i am pleased that operators will also have to comply with sustainability criteria and laws on indigenous peoples .
in this respect the possession of reserves is a matter of basic national security .
i voted for the proposal for a critical infrastructure warning information network ciwin .
i should like to point out the following in this connection 
my constituents will see the benefit of this legislation in cuts to their bills .
however , I voted for the internal market gas and electricity package because 
i remain uneasy about the non binding nature of the eu agency for the cooperation of energy regulators .
i congratulate parliament on pushing the member states to go further than they wanted to go .
this is another example of parliament guaranteeing the victory of the broader european cause over national self interest and protectionism .
i have therefore voted against the proposal tabled by the committee .
previous experience of labelling , in particular , gives cause for careful consideration .
we need tyres to be safer , more fuel efficient and quieter .
in writing . lt I agree that the regulation of voice call prices should be continued .
i believe that the market should define its own prices in accordance with the basic principles of healthy competition .
the directive strengthens the position of the european monopolies in relation to their international competitors .
whether they are used for business or private purposes is of secondary importance .
it is for that reason that I have voted in favour of this report .
i therefore voted for this report .
we already have price regulation in place as a result of the roaming I regulation .
the result has been that operators cluster around this price ceiling , which does not benefit consumers .
the cost of data transmission will also be reduced , to eur 0.50 per megabyte in 20i definitely endorse the report .
i therefore voted for this report .
that is why we voted against .
in 2009 , it has already been announced that 225 will go .
secondly , the activities of recreational fishermen do not affect stocks to any great extent .
we believe that in the national interest the immigration pact was not satisfactory 
i voted for adoption of the busuttil report .
it is an important report , because migration is one of the most significant challenges facing the european union .
by sending them back to their country of origin we may in fact be sentencing them to death .
thank you very much .
the right of asylum is to become a vehicle for mass immigration on an unprecedented scale .
the current economic crisis may once again encourage us to follow this logic when investing in transport infrastructure .
a team of eight national and commission experts was selected .
thank you , mr kallas .
the figure could amount to eur 500 million , as commission vice president antonio tajani told the press .
these have been difficult days , further aggravated by the weather conditions of the last 48 hours .
everything must be done in close collaboration with the italian authorities .
we will do whatever is possible to help people in this disaster area .
is it because we suspect some fraud or irregularity ?
so why , then , have we done it ?
as representatives of the european taxpayer , we have the task of ensuring compliance with this agreement .
for example how many accounts outside the budget did the council have in 2007 ?
that is what we want today and that is what we want after the elections in june .
those are not audited .
they have refused to give us papers .
they have refused to give us documents .
the first is the credibility and the role of our own parliament .
it is very important to say , from the outset , what parliament can and cannot do .
so we are not saying we want to do something else .
the third reason is the respect and the preparation for the lisbon treaty .
the last and probably the most important point is transparency vis à vis the citizens .
so for those four important reasons of principle , we believe that we must vote in favour of postponement .
it is also based on references to documents and the eu treaty .
its task is also to oversee the use of funds and the budget's general implementation .
indeed , as things stand at the moment , we refuse to grant an extension .
hence the justified demands for an activities report , transparency and clarity .
what do these accounts contain ?
our job as members of the european parliament is to scrutinise the council's use of budget resources .
this we do because we represent the taxpayers .
how many confidential accounts are there ?
we therefore have no transparency .
this is not democracy .
then there is the use of funds .
de mr president , I should like to say two things on behalf of this committee .
congratulations to the rapporteur , who asked straightforward questions and received no answers .
the problems lie in the capital cities , not brussels .
we are a europe of citizens .
we have to be accountable to everyone .
i was mentioned by name I was accused of making nonsensical remarks .
i firmly reject this accusation .
de mr president , mr martin has just addressed me in a most outrageous way .
secondly , I should like to raise an objection to the comparison of the council with the mafia .
this is something that simply cannot be said in a proper democracy .
finally , I would like to thank the committee for the excellent work it has done .
much attention has been paid .
ah , the council has arrived !
perhaps we can start the discussion all over again !
the council is , of course , welcome , but they have come for the next debate .
the debate is closed .
the next item is the joint debate on
they must prove their reliability throughout europe , and must also have a sound financial structure .
transport managers should be able to demonstrate either many yearsexperience or a high level of training .
these lead to distortions of competition and weaken national undertakings .
the reintroduction of the possibility of taking a weekly rest period after 12 days does not compromise safety .
we are awaiting proposals from the commission on this , as cabotage should also serve to avoid unladen journeys .
the company's good reputation may be lost as a result of its involvement in human or drugs trafficking .
the czech presidency considers the finalisation of this collection of legal regulations to be highly important .
this , too , helps to ensure road safety .
i would therefore like to thank you for your willingness to adopt these laws so quickly .
the sector should not have to put up with all kinds of national outpourings a day longer .
it does not work in this case .
i would like to make a similar point about international coach transport too .
if amendments 17 and 18 are not adopted , I will be voting against the end result .
the thwarting has been fierce , which is very bad news .
i therefore believe that the position adopted is ultimately the right one .
thus , I am grateful to the two rapporteurs .
there is no prospect of an opening up in 2014 , as per parliament's request .
so , if social abuse is supposed to be a reason , it is certainly not the case here .
winston churchill said if you have 10 000 regulations you destroy all respect for the law .
it will benefit carriers , drivers and users , particularly in the current economic climate .
with regard to road transport , there are two important points I should like to make .
the first one is , indeed , access to the profession .
this is a good transitional measure that was necessary in order to define more clearly what is possible .
this has now been clarified as three times over a seven day period .
they meet the criteria .
you are very often alone in the car in strange surroundings .
this compromise version represents a fair and balanced way to combine the various interests .
our common aim is to make road transport more efficient and sustainable .
i believe that was not a point of order , but a matter of courtesy .
the other thing I want to say here concerns cabotage itself .
some say they want to see restrictions , whilst others say we have far too many restrictions .
then we shall be credible .
information should be clear and accessible , which is often a problem in the transport sector .
on behalf of my group I have tabled just three additional amendments for tomorrow's vote .
these are important legal regulations which are of great interest both to consumers and to the transport sector .
the czech presidency of course welcomes these proposals and attaches great importance to them .
large and small companies operate and journeys can take several days or just a few minutes .
at the same time it is also for the most part in line with our opinion on the proposals .
of course , good law making is not easy , but today we are taking a big step forward .
i was also pleased to hear what mr svoboda had to say .
maritime transport on the mediterranean sea takes place under different conditions from transport across straits .
there are just a few points on which I should like to expand .
in other words , we must take great care .
on behalf of the pse group . mr president , I want to congratulate both our rapporteurs .
one group is particularly dependent on clear rules .
in the case of air transport , it has become apparent that the rules are not clear enough .
i myself have received some of their accounts .
it is a disaster .
with regard to passenger rights , there have always been two alternatives to choose from .
there are many tasks for the next commission in this regard .
this is urgently needed .
so first the service and then compensation for delayed services .
that is the conclusion .
they travel to the us .
it was evident from all of the debates .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
it specifically concerns the movement of persons across the czech german border .
the sitting was suspended at 6.15 p.m. pending question time and resumed at 6.30 p.m. 
question time commission 
the next item is question time b6 0227 / 2009 .
there exists a strong potential for cross border trade in on line commerce .
everyone wants and deserves the best deal going , whether they live in lisbon or london .
surely that is not all to do with regulatory differences .
that could be an objective reason for saying that the price differential is such and such .
the mandate does not cover smes .
finally , a number of pre accession and neighbourhood countries have requested macroeconomic assistance from the european union .
from the countries of the southern region , practically all but russia and azerbaijan have requested it .
subject state aid to non eu european countries
i thank the commissioner for her helpful reply .
will the commissioner investigate this matter and use all her powers to assist ?
even then it is not guaranteed that we can be successful but it is worth a try .
furthermore , the use of the european globalisation fund can be considered under certain circumstances and conditions .
it is not correct , and I can prove it with facts and figures .
this initiative was previewed in the commission's recovery plan the previous month .
in other words this measure is of particular benefit to smes .
it is still premature for any assessment on how and if the member states will follow these recommendations .
but I would like to be even more precise .
so what does this data tell us ?
for detailed information I would refer the honourable member to the report itself .
the 2008 call notably succeeded in covering the priority given to small and medium sized enterprises .
in total , 74 % of all participations were smes .
thank you also , commissioner , for the tables which you have given me .
you have mentioned several areas where new member states are developing their activities in both programmes .
i am sure that this will be an example which will be followed later on by other regions .
subject communicating with citizens
online consultation is commonly used .
i thank the commissioner for her answer , and I agree the commission is certainly making some efforts .
this is something that we will do in cooperation with the other institutions .
of course we will try to do that as quickly as possible , not as part of the campaign .
verification of credentials see minutes
this can be condensed down very simply into four very clear areas .
such an outcome will be a very welcome development for eu performers .
this is truly innovative .
end of the intended declaration .
i believe that all the fears expressed by those who are against term extension will prove unfounded .
parliament's report calls on the commission to perform impact assessments and to monitor this measure .
therefore , a balance will still have to be found along these lines .
i consider the compromise to be satisfactory and welcome the success achieved .
i come from a point of view where I like copyright .
session musicians deserve the help they will be getting from this proposal .
i therefore congratulate all those who have been involved in coming to a sensible , just and sustainable consensus .
i would therefore like to ask colleagues who have reservations to reconsider and vote for this report .
i recognise that it is not perfect and that there are concerns .
all the other key players have reached agreement , and performers need clarification sooner , rather than later .
moreover , this money does not go directly to artists .
i believe , notwithstanding all of the hard work and goodwill , that meps should reject this proposal .
we already have an established law at the national level .
in addition , the directive includes several recommendations regarding further work to be done .
this time , however , I find it difficult to follow his intentions .
will an extension increase cultural diversity and facilitate the writing of new compositions ?
what effect has the copyright extension in the united states had on developments there ?
it is my belief that the commission should try again .
commissioner , have a rethink , rework the proposal and come back !
mr president , let me be clear I support the extension of copyright from 50 to 70 years .
the problem is the balance between the multinational record companies and the featured artists .
these artists should have been able to reclaim their property that they alone were responsible for creating .
from any type of moral perspective that is unfair .
ms lichtenberger made a fine address .
a 70 year term is open to all new innovative business models .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
copyright existed before the internet , and refers to a different era .
action plan on urban mobility debate 
mr president , commissioner , thank you .
we are going to propose to the commission the action plan that it should have proposed to us .
why ?
because , today , 60 % of europeans live in the urban community .
i should like to say that this is a report that is based on the principle of subsidiarity .
helping someone does not mean replacing them , it means contributing towards a better solution to problems !
of course , there are aspects and details that require further clarification or debate .
its aim will not be to constrain local authorities , but rather to help them .
i should like to give an example .
so , how is that linked to our debate this evening ?
the situation is in fact serious .
i thank him for his commitment and for his specific proposals .
the report contains a number of interesting proposals .
an obvious one is the collection of information , of comparable data which will help map out problems .
every year 40 000 people die on the roads of europe that is 40 000 too many .
if the inland shipping capacity is already present in european cities , this should be utilised and promoted .
legislative measures at european level are inadmissible for urban traffic .
that would take some of the strain off a city .
it is also important to take account of demographic change .
our society is constantly ageing .
transport is a fundamental problem in urban areas .
this concerns both the promotion of good experiences and the propagation of innovative , technical and organisational solutions .
combining the potential of transport , information technology and telecommunications is useful here .
they lose a lot of time because of the bad organisation of transport .
this is much more to do with subsidiarity .
i have made sure that we do not revert to this type of debate .
the question I asked myself was what can the european union's added value be ? 
the answer is , firstly , its desire to act .
we can ensure that they make urban transport more attractive to users .
that is our proposal .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 142 
european citizensquality of life depends directly on making urban transport more convenient and greener .
for this reason , making transport accessible and supporting interoperability are vital actions .
something will have to happen , however , and we will need to get things moving .
there is need for this initiative .
many of the things included in the action plan are projects which are already underway .
in addition , we are also dealing with the very important question of data security .
and , as a result , we will not secure the necessary investment .
we have all tried to avoid the heavy handed long words that too often characterise declarations of principle .
in addition , urban transport and urban mobility are very much part of urban development .
secondly , there is an ever increasing danger of all the data collected being misused .
it also safeguards the use of personal data .
we still know too little about whether potential users are willing or able to pay .
however , I do think that we need to add some intelligence to all modes of transport .
i therefore believe that the resources should be diversified in the years to come .
this will make transport in europe safer and more efficient , while promoting environmental protection and energy efficiency too .
it is in all our interests to make this a reality .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for her work .
i wish mrs jensen and the commissioner every success .
that is very important .
we have also spent some time discussing the amount of funding to be earmarked for this .
so , mr tajani , you have got off the ground with a robust negotiating mandate .
we should be aware that the current state of affairs in road transport is very worrying .
extensive use in large urban areas of telematic applications , which combine transport issues with information technology and telecommunications 
now , in the context of the climate debate , this debate has naturally taken on new importance .
marco polo ii offers improved planning security , because it is timetabled to run until 31 december 20it has a budget of eur 450 million .
the programme is based on displacing traffic and reducing the overload on road transport .
there is a problem , though .
this reduction is not enough .
i cannot understand why the other institutions should wish to pick holes in amendment we have a well stocked fund for sustainable transport .
why should we not lower the threshold more for this sector ?
for the programme to achieve its aims , marco polo ii must be made more attractive .
the legal basis needs to be changed and verification procedures need to be simpler and clearer .
rapporteur . de madam president , commissioner , I agree with you .
we must and will displace traffic wherever possible , but it is difficult .
that really would be a pity , hence this compromise .
the debate is closed .
european rail network for competitive freight debate 
the comments relating to cooperation with third countries affected by the corridor have been accepted .
the infrastructure for freight needs to be brought under european policy as it already has a significant international dimension .
the first principle is the identification of corridors and thus of the network .
this identification is based on economic rather than political factors .
my congratulations once again to the rapporteur .
thirdly , it must be clear that the overall capacity of rail transport must not be reduced .
as many of you know , john bowis was taken ill recently in brussels and was hospitalised .
his place is taken today by my friend and colleague , philip bushill matthews .
they should not have to go to court in order to achieve it .
the proposal before us now is our chance to make this a reality .
we therefore warmly welcome the forthcoming debate .
the central question in this context is what can the european union do for patients ?
i look forward to your debate .
the directive provides a measured response to these requirements .
however , I am afraid the recent vote has left a bitter taste in my mouth .
it would be a good idea if this were looked at again .
any form of gender based discrimination whatsoever practised by healthcare facilities , insurers or state officials is unacceptable .
i have one single point to make on the trakatellis report .
allow me to start by saying that my group thinks this is a very good report .
we must also point out , however , which areas of the report we particularly approved of .
perhaps a small part of the scientific community knows about it , but not every local doctor .
the first of these is that we want to see a dual legal basis .
we need this , and it is a condition of our support .
that is expressly not what we are talking about now .
we are talking about a pragmatic approach .
how can we make the system such that patients benefit from it ?
patients are in such a weak position .
that must not happen .
i very much appreciate , by the way , that the council is present here today .
a compromise is therefore necessary .
we consider that there must be exceptions for rare diseases or life threatening situations on waiting lists .
i have listened with great respect to what mrs roth behrendt said here on this matter .
what , therefore , does this directive need to improve ?
we want specific legislation .
we , ourselves , go much further .
furthermore , the proposal is superfluous . for the reimbursement of costs is already settled .
i was lucky enough to be able to afford to pay .
therefore , I am delighted that this uncertainty and confusion has been cleared up once and for all .
it is up to you to consider and choose the outcome you want to see .
here we have a piece of legislation which does forge a close relationship with european citizens .
it is only those who are desperate who travel abroad .
this is truly an improvement on the commission's proposal .
the alde's core amendment has been to appoint a european patients ombudsman .
after all , they are at the mercy of their care providers .
we have not yet reached any agreement on how to identify that section of the patient population .
i want to start by saying that we have no objection whatsoever to cross border healthcare .
this describes my sentiments too about the current crisis I see growth and recovery in everything .
introducing patient mobility will not only have an impact on healthcare .
the main advantage offered by this regulation is that it provides a win win situation .
things have largely depended on the sending country's very latest regulations .
i am sure that this regulation will improve the quality of each of our lives .
it will give me great pleasure to support this excellent document .
the aim cannot be to create a market for healthcare services .
a country that wishes to guarantee healthcare for all must be able to plan for care in this way .
the rights and safety of patients must come first .
finally , I would like to wish john bowis a speedy recovery .
in my opinion , because we have these two different philosophies we also need a double legal base .
public planning will be made more difficult and the national healthcare system is at risk of being drained .
we must take care , however , that this does not go too far .
it therefore seems necessary to specify the responsibilities of the member states in this area .
accordingly , we feel it is essential to alter the legal basis .
we do not therefore understand why the commission has not included article 152 of the ec treaty .
in conclusion , I would like to thank rapporteur mr bowis for his responsible and very competent work .
the litmus test of this directive is its legal basis .
these people now have a choice .
what manner of people are these ?
it would seem that new iron curtains are to be put up .
first , there should be no forced health tourism .
it should not be the case that insurers pressure patients to go elsewhere to receive cheap care .
secondly , there must be some minimum quality guarantees .
this involves national or international hospital accreditations .
therefore I welcome the bowis report , and wish its author a speedy return to health .
i would , however , like to draw attention to three important elements in this report .
why are you doing this ?
is there anything more cowardly ?
i will be voting for the focus to be on the patients .
sv mr president , all patients should have the right to healthcare when they need it .
i am astonished by the negative stance taken by my socialist colleagues in this respect .
eu legislation must not put these systems of solidarity in jeopardy .
health cannot be a business .
that is why we intend to reject this commission proposal .
the heated debate preceding this directive is astonishing .
but what happens ?
i am pleased that we have got this far , commissioner .
we now have the opportunity in this house to take up our responsibility .
may the council also take up its responsibility !
the proposal will at the same time improve patient rights , as mrs roth behrendt said .
i fully agree , and very much hope that this ambition will be confirmed .
this issue has to be addressed .
however , the two objectives are not incompatible .
prior authorisation for hospital treatment has to remain a safeguard mechanism , applicable when justified .
such administrative mechanisms run the risk of being both cumbersome and arbitrary .
applause 
regarding the proposed exclusion of organ transplantation , I simply cannot agree .
however , the issue of organ allocation is a different matter .
today , we can take an important step forward towards the adoption of this directive .
the vote today will light the road ahead .
i would like to thank the rapporteurs from the various committees for the remarkable job which they have done .
health is not a commodity to be bought and sold on the internal market .
this proposal is a disgrace .
it shows the commission is blindly pursuing its discredited and obsolete liberalisation agenda .
it just wants to privatise everything it can and to further centralise power in its own hands .
the european commission should hang their heads in shame and should withdraw this proposal immediately .
economically speaking , too , a better use of the capacity of specialist clinics will bring benefits with it .
public money is leaking into services abroad for the rich .
that is why I cannot support the adoption of the directive .
the czech presidency is aware that the organisation of health systems falls fully within the competency of member states .
the system will ensure immunity of course , in order to encourage reporting .
these figures are unacceptably high .
they paint a disturbing picture that affects not only patients but also their families and friends .
this could be avoided if the needles they were using were replaced with a safer kind .
it also sends a signal that this is an area of great potential for eu added value .
this reflects the fact that some member states have devolved systems of health care .
we also agree that the scale and cost of data collection should not be disproportionate to the expected benefits .
that is the added value of the european union .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
in this implementation proposal , specific mention should be made for funding and cofinancing in the following areas 
these are also reasons why the area of rare diseases is an eu health strategy priority .
the european strategy is supplemented by the proposal for a council recommendation on action within the member states .
one important sector for action is in collecting expertise via the european reference networks .
the information must also be made accessible , and the trakatellis report provides for all these matters .
thirdly , this is a controversial subject that has also been tackled by mr liese .
many rare diseases are hereditary .
that term summons up very unpleasant associations , as mr liese has already said .
thank you for your attention .
various options are available , and we are exploring them .
one option that is working well in many member states is public private partnership .
it is up to us to ensure that this is more than just a catalogue of good intentions .
for that reason we must reject this amendment .
doing so would mean that we would still be faced with the selection of embryos .
it is naturally of the greatest importance that public health policy should be given primacy over political correctness .
i do not think so .
i do not agree with that .
in addition to the patients themselves , this action will also affect their relatives and friends .
there was reference to the need for funding .
that engagement of citizens is a vital part of work in this area .

this is a private scheme .
mr president , can I reply to mr cohn bendit's point and mr hans peter martin's point ?
i think that there is a simple solution .
the simple solution is for the other 399 members to do the same .

european rail network for competitive freight 
nl I wish to raise a point of order based on article 168 2 .
theetc .should also include the recital , which is amendment 1 before the vote on amendment 100 
i would encourage other colleagues to put the patients first .
mr president , very briefly , I am trying to be helpful , but am getting hungry .
these are important votes and it is a very full agenda and I have every sympathy with you .
2007 discharge european gnss supervisory authority

action plan on urban mobility 
i would call on the member states to reconsider that decision .
the euro sceptic argument I do not expect will have much traction in this house .
et I truly have a lot of comments .
this means that it will help save 20 % of energy consumption through increased energy efficiency .
et this morning we also discussed and just voted on certain reports from the health care package .
as a result , the preparation of a separate urban transport strategy is altogether justified .
of envious neptune , is now bound in with shame ,
hath made a shameful conquest of itself . 
if there is a better description than that , I have yet to hear it .
i was unaware that you possessed such a talent for rhapsody .
however , in taking that lead , we have to show moral leadership .
the proposal complicates matters for libraries , archives , art schools and independent film makers .
european action in this area was necessary .
that is the precise opposite of medicine it is murder .
written explanations of vote
the free democratic party in the european parliament is opposed to using tax revenue to clear the deficit .
the possibility of using tax revenue to clear the deficit has not been totally excluded .
we expect these decisions to be taken before the end of april 200in writing . I abstained as I am a member of the pension fund .
that applies to their incomes , pensions and expenses .
however , I do not see this as a conflict of interest .
making buildings more energy efficient would also have a massive positive impact on carbon emissions in the eu .
it would be naïve to ignore the role of eu regulation in the current crisis afflicting the car industry .
this is because the report is insufficient and does not put enough emphasis on the right issues .
it is an important step towards equal rights for all passengers .
bus and coach passengers should enjoy rights similar to those of rail and air passengers .
talented musicians are being short changed by the current system .
i regret that there have been many false claims about this legislation .
the compromise reached is a step in the right direction , but is certainly not yet optimal .
this regulation would achieve precisely the opposite of the actual objective , which is better use of available capacities .
instead of limiting passenger transport , a solution is needed to deal with bottlenecks and shortages in railway capacity .
two areas are stifling rail freight in europe .
however , unfortunately , the majority did not agree with our position .
the member states themselves are responsible for providing medical care and for organising their health systems .
however , I would insist that the member states have sole competence to organise and fund health systems .
however , we remain concerned that the rules as drafted are not clear enough .
it is no surprise that , only recently , tory mep dan hannan advocated a privatised approach to healthcare .
however , the issue of pre authorisation is of concern to me .
prior authorisation in this directive negates patientsrights .
for this reason , the commission's proposal for a directive is a good thing .
i also value the efforts of mr bowis to reach a compromise on this fiendishly difficult subject .
i voted for the proposal on patient safety .
i did not support amendment so I could not support the overall report .
such simplification procedures are crucial for reducing the administrative burden at national , regional and local level .
to date , only four countries have done so , one of which is the netherlands .

climate and energy package and maritime transport package signature of acts 
this public signing will help to emphasise the importance of european legislation to european citizens .
thank you minister .
conclusions of the g20 summit debate 
the eu played a very significant role through its proposals and attitudes .
in this way we will strengthen these institutions financially and also restore their respect and authority .
fourthly , there is one remaining area requiring serious and careful discussion and a solution .
five minutes are set aside for the council , and it speaks for 20 minutes .
i believe this shows disrespect for the meps .
you know our rules of procedure as well as I do , mrs berès .
member of the commission . mr president , the results of the london g20 summit are substantial .
trade protectionism is a potential threat in any global recession .
the g20 took a major step towards the global regulatory convergence that europe has long been calling for .
decisive action was also agreed on non cooperative offshore tax havens .
we welcome , in particular , the reference to the end of banking secrecy .
this recession demands a coordinated response at international level .
that is the only way that we can all come out of it .
investors must know that the same standards apply throughout the world .
in this way , the global economy will be able grow by usd 150 million a year .
we now need to act quickly , in a coordinated and effective manner , exactly as olli rehn said .
next time it will be 5 % , when unemployment increases to 27 million unemployed .
let us be fair and let us create the jobs .
we can do it together .
we have to provide space for new initiatives .
europe's experience in this area is invaluable .
this is particularly crucial because solidarity is extremely important in difficult times .
since we are in the same boat , let us think in the same way !
now , the imf puts the figure at usd 4 000 billion .
that is the price of the mad dash to cash for profit and to profit for cash .
it prescribed homeopathic remedies where major surgery is obviously needed .
they are demanding not soothing words , but strong , practical action , now !
nonetheless , I should like to say very clearly that we should not exaggerate the importance of summit scenarios .
the political will to act should already exist .
then we would have one summit less .
to date we have had a lot of talk on this but no clear resolutions .
the eu and , more importantly , the political actors failed dramatically in the financial crisis .
they must draw conclusions from that and first learn what they did wrong .
therefore , the regulation proposed by the commission and amended by parliament will quickly come into effect .
however , we must also take into account the fears of our fellow citizens and respond positively to them .
what are these if not unemployment benefits , which we have defended with great clamour ?
clearly , in this respect , the g20 was incompetent .
two points the g20 conclusions assess the benefits of the doha round at usd 150 billion .
where does this figure come from ?
how can it be justified ?
we call on you , commissioner , to explain .
what we need to do now is make this a reality .
we need to continue in this direction .
that is what I wanted to say .
mr rasmussen and mrs starkevičiūttalked of pouring money into the economy .
in other words these measures must not lead to any dramatic long term threat to the stability of public finances .
the current economy is sick .
we cannot expect miracle cures to be found within the next three or four months .
none of us exist in isolation .
i will of course report this to the commission , president barroso and my colleague , joaquín almunia .
as mr daul said , we need more , not less , trade .
as replacement for louis michel next month , I am also involved in this because of my portfolio responsibilities .
indeed , the developing countries are among those which are suffering most from this economic recession .
in the current economic climate the value of concluding doha has gone up very substantially .
doha would boost the world economy and prevent protectionism from picking up .
applause 
this factor is particularly worrying as the eu is at present preparing to launch the eastern partnership .
the parties winning seats in the new parliament must agree on a realistic solution that respects democratic principles .
you perhaps know that czech prime minister mirek topolánek also visited kishinev yesterday .
he met with president voronin , with prime minister greceanu and with opposition representatives .
the main message delivered by the presidency accorded fully with the long term actions of kalman mizsei .
however , the opposition and a number of non governmental organisations declared that the elections had been marred by fraud .
the opposition is checking the electoral roles in order to produce evidence of this claim .
there is a further very serious reason for concern .
during the crisis the moldovan authorities committed serious violations of human rights .
according to the reports almost 250 people were arrested following the violent protests on 7 april .
he also called for a transparent and proper investigation of the events .
the investigation in moldova must include international participation in order to be considered reliable and fair .
moldova is facing very serious economic problems arising from the global financial crisis .
there is an urgent need for a functioning government .
external assistance will also be required , including considerable imf involvement .
it is in our interests to help moldova overcome the current crisis and to proceed further along this path .
we are following developments closely and seeking ways to promote dialogue and reconciliation between political forces in the country .
we continue to give this matter close attention .
it is crucial that allegations of serious human rights violations by the security forces are investigated thoroughly and swiftly .
today the situation in moldova is very fragile .
in other words , we care for moldova and its citizens .
the head of state changes , but the citizens remain .
the forthcoming european parliament ad hoc mission to moldova is very important .
we cannot accept that , since european integration means open dialogue .
let us therefore help moldova .
no more obstacles to lawyers or ngos , no more withholding the names and numbers of those detained .
we must show sensitivity to bilateral relations but , nonetheless , insist agreements are honoured .
president voronin and his comrades must commit to that cause .
prominent persons in moldovan society are asking for an explanation .
we must confront the moldovan authorities .
european consultation regarding the far reaching consequences of such a sweeping decision is certainly reasonable .
we should avoid these events being taken as an excuse for a unilateral solution on transnistria .
let me say , though , that the osce report was not completely uncritical .
the media must be given freedom .
maltreatment of peaceful demonstrators can never be accepted .
we have hundreds of young people who have been detained , sometimes even tortured .
we have a huge volume of specific data on this indicating election rigging .
i think that everyone should also condemn the arrests of journalists and the massive violations of freedom of expression .
you said benita is an instinctive optimist .
written statements rule 142 
i cannot fail but come to the harsh conclusion that for some europeans tibet is closer than moldova .
this happens probably when the road to chişinău passes through moscow .
i feel that the accusations being levelled at romania are also being targeted at the european union .
consolidating stability and prosperity in the western balkans situation in bosnia and herzegovina debate 
fortunately , the same cannot be said of hungary , estonia or romania .
the justification for this is that no similar demands were made of slovakia or poland , for example .
it should be obvious why this analogy is not valid .
bosnia herzegovina has been and continues to be the subject of intense negotiations at all levels of the council .
member states are supplementing the european agenda through their own efforts at a bilateral level .
bosnia herzegovina must carry out significant changes to its internal structures and decision making processes .
they are lagging far behind what is needed .
the priorities of the european partnership are also clear .
change is essential .
this constitutes a real test of maturity and it is fully supported by the eu .
the 5 + 2 list is not just another catalogue of supplementary terms and conditions .
however , initiatives at a political level require broader support .
the role of the media in particular should be more constructive .
croatia's negotiations are quite far advanced .
there have been calls for consolidation of the european union .
it is the main driving force of much needed reform and greater stability in the western balkans .
unfortunately , the negotiations are currently blocked because of the border dispute between croatia and slovenia .
over the past months we have insisted on the importance of these elections for the country's european future .
the commissioner met him back in october .
where are we today ?
the ethnic division in bosnia and herzegovina has deepened .
the lack of trust has increased .
the question of state ownership must be resolved .
constitutional reform must be tackled on the basis of a broad political and social consensus .
frustration is spreading everywhere .
good reports have again been produced here and will have broad support .
it is a long and difficult road and the objective will not be achieved overnight .
our willingness must be there .
this is the dynamic that we applied so marvellously during the last major enlargement of the eu .
however , kosovo reveals the true face of a policy aimed at the balkanisation of europe .
mr president , the ibrisagic report of course emphasises that stability in the western balkans is our major priority .
patience in all matters is a virtue , not least in foreign policy .
therefore I welcome this debate and the clear confirmation of the commitment to future expansion .
the balkansnatural vocation is to join the european union .
the first is the disunity of the european union .
i expect this will not be possible in the near or distant future .
the balkans has been and always will be a european region .
the presidency considers this step to be a very important signal to the whole region .
we consider it unhelpful for the expansion agenda to be burdened with bilateral issues .
we are prepared to continue providing assistance in this unavoidably long process .
2009 is an important year and it could be decisive for bosnia and herzegovina .
bosnia and herzegovina simply cannot be allowed to remain behind .
we want bosnia and herzegovina to achieve progress .
the vote will take place on friday 24 april 200written statements rule 142 
however , it is a region whose prospects for joining the eu are clear and unambiguous .
we are lobbying for support for the nuclear weapons convention and the hiroshima nagasaki protocol , because disarmament is possible .
the forthcoming may meeting of the non proliferation treaty preparatory committee is an important preparatory step for this conference .
we must deal with them and resolve them by strengthening the mechanism for monitoring adherence .
this is the year of all nuclear debates .
after all , the us and russia are the undisputed global nuclear hegemons .
this is what this report is all about and this is the spirit of the socialist plenary amendments .
non proliferation is absolutely fundamental .
what this actually means is disarmament instead of modernisation of british and french atomic weapons .
unfortunately , not even the npt has been able to prevent that .
that is extremely important .
this is indeed a subject of great significance .
now there is a unique opportunity .
ican was there long before obama as an international campaign for the abolition of nuclear weapons .
this also marks a unique first step in the activities of the european parliament .
education , anti discrimination and the right to work must be secured .
often their right to sexuality and maternity is restricted or there are forced abortions and sterilisations .
the president cut off the speaker 
we also urge member states and the community's executive to ensure free access and the distribution .
if the eu is to have any credibility in this debate , it must lead by example .
i can only tell you how important this is with reference to my country .
only 15 % of disabled children are integrated into the school system .
our support for ratification this week should make clear three points .
the conference was held directly under the auspices of the presidency and constituted one of the presidential events .
the european parliament must bear its responsibility for improving the conditions of people with disabilities .
the rights of disabled people are broken regularly .
recently in my home town of poznań an incident occurred which is symptomatic of this .
a member of the polish national parliament parked his car in a place reserved for the disabled .
thank you very much .
question time council 
the next item is question time b6 0227 / 09 .
subject anti lisbon rhetoric
madam president , may I thank the minister for his reply .
the eu affects eu citizens very often in an abstract way and its institutions are very difficult to understand .
the council confirmed this coordination based approach of the commission in its conclusions of 27 march 200the council declared that acceptable solutions could take various forms , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity .
therefore smes are more burdened by these complicated tax systems .
the council took the view that the use of these substances could potentially mask poor hygiene practices .
the text will be submitted for wto assessment within the framework of consultations with trading partners .
with the help of developed countries developing countries should draw up strategies and plans for building a low carbon economy .
in order to implement the copenhagen agreement it is essential to have sufficient , predictable and timely financial support .
thank you , mrs doyle .
interjection from avril doyle that is because they thought we would not reach question 10 ! 
however , it is obviously too soon to reveal our cards by publishing some of the numbers .
we have an idea of how much funding will be needed to implement the global plan .
questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers see annex .
the sitting was suspended at 20.10 and resumed at 21.00 . 
ecodesign requirements for energy related products debate 
in this sense , I believe we missed the opportunity to do more for the environment with less bureaucracy .
there is also the review in 20change is needed , but change is also possible without overburdening companies and households .
by building a low carbon and resource efficient economy we can give a new impetus to competitiveness .
i have a vision of how the european product of the future will look .
to my mind , this directive is a good example of integrated product politics .
i will pass it on to the bureau after this sitting .
the problems we face in terms of resource use go beyond energy .
the commissioner should know that .
this problem is getting worse because of growing economies and populations .
the fact is that the current growth model and concept is not sustainable .
as I said , all this could have been covered by the directive .
as I said , a missed opportunity .
our directive on ecodesign aims at innovation .
another regrettable example of the directive on ecodesign is energy labelling .
meanwhile , it is completely unclear what that means , which is hardly a good example of ecodesign .
hopefully , the evaluation will provide an opportunity for improvement .
does it place the european union and european manufacturers at the top of the market ?
another important means at our disposal is the energy labelling of equipment .
written statements rule 142 
improving energy efficiency is the quickest and cheapest way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
only in that way can we secure the necessary growth and jobs beyond the recovery phase .
finally , I will deal with ce marking and the abolition of national labelling .
it is a very important measure in a very important industry .
according to my information , producers of construction materials are very interested in the ce mark .
i wish this legislation much success .
there is also a need to address all the points that we have mentioned .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
we have done a constructive job , and I believe that we avoided resorting to dictates or mutual recrimination .
that is why we think the threshold of 90 % is more reasonable .
amendments will be tabled to this end tomorrow in plenary .
let me put things into perspective .
this affects the operation of the internal market , since honest businesses have competitive disadvantages because of tax fraud .
mr president , I will conclude .
parliament needs to be strict in this area .
the g20 conference also made the dismantling of tax havens one of the key objectives .
two systems are involved here exchange of information between tax authorities and withholding tax .
withholding tax , on the other hand , shows many virtues .
understand that one if you can !
however , any blow can now be struck in the fight against this new hydra of banking secrecy .
i hope that we will vote in favour of these reports tomorrow .
however , that is not our main problem today .
why do we find ourselves in the situation we are in now ?
it is due , above all , to the fact that we now have ownerless capitalism .
they get to buy chateaux in france or play golf in spain .
this means that the states must say at the outset that they will not take all the risks .
it is an extremely difficult thing to do , but it must be done .
i realise that it is difficult for the commissioner to reach true agreement on this under the unanimity rule .
a final comment on mrs lulling , who contrasts the two systems of information exchange and taxation at source .
i think that that is not really the point .
it is premature to speculate today on how they will react to our approach .
the eu first needs to reach a unanimous agreement internally .
madam president , I will be very brief , as I have already spoken at length just now .
fr madam president , I asked to speak in order to make a personal statement .
i wanted to make this clarification .
written statements rule 142 
the rapporteur's proposed deadline for this , which is 2014 , should receive our full support .
counterterrorism efforts focus the spotlight on asians , especially those of pakistani origin .
thirty two per cent of british muslims report being subject to discrimination at airports .
if possible , all safeguards for profiling should be drawn together in a single legal instrument .
the agency is about to present a good practices handbook for combating and preventing ethnic profiling .
it is subject to supervision by independent public authorities .
all these principles also apply to profiling as one of the ways of performing processing of personal data .
why ?
i did it myself as a kid actually .
sometimesprofilingcan be necessary , but such cases must be clearly delineated and protected against abuse .
such people get the message from our society that they are always suspect , less worthy and unwelcome .
the commission is currently launching a consultation on the challenges posed by new technologies to data protection .
the vote will take place tomorrow , friday , 24 april 2009 , at 12 noon .
i must say that the council's common position a few months after our first reading was rather disappointing .
we did move a step forward , though , and there was a very constructive atmosphere .
the parliamentary delegation , too , was a strong group .
this makes for a certain consistency , and that is important for later use as well .
we have obtained greater transparency .
those two texts would be nothing without this one , however .
this regulation is , in fact , the enforcer for the other two .
for the moment , any assessment of their volume can only be intuitive .
the vote will take place tomorrow , friday , 24 april 2009 , at 12 noon .
agenda of the next sitting see minutes
the president declared the sitting closed at 11.05 p.m. 
the barroso commission attaches great importance to the correct application of community law , making it a top priority .
thank you .
it is as serious as that .
here , on this aspect , I do not believe that we can demand too much from the commission .
the proposal before us should help solve this problem and establish a common european payment area .
this document already has some history .
this was not previously available .
i can therefore say that I am fully satisfied with the result achieved .
i welcome this .
we reduce information costs by having a common currency .
i urge you all to reflect on this .
it is not perfect .
compromises seldom are .
many of the details have been reordered .
however , this must not lead to a reduction in official control .
game gathered in the woods must not be used .
that is a good approach , because there are very many forms of comitology .
there will also be a reduction in administrative costs , and this will enable operators to be more competitive .
thank you for your work and we are pleased that we have a constructive proposal .
the main objective of the regulation before us is the guarantee of hygiene and human health and safety .
however , recently it has been stressed that the commission should step up efforts to preserve biodiversity .
the cooperation with the commission was very agreeable and for that I am very grateful .
thank you , mr rübig .
it is a very difficult time as we approach the end of the mandate .
the next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions concerning women's rights in afghanistan .
this law is fundamental to ensure that there is freedom of expression and of the media in afghanistan .
without that , anything that we are doing in afghanistan is not worth it .
i agree entirely with what ana maria gomes has just said .
what afghanistan signs up to in geneva , it cannot reject in kabul .
the authorities have a duty not to give in to extremism in any way and not to retreat .
meanwhile , journalists are now also being threatened with the death penalty by the state .
we must uncompromisingly oppose this law and the oppression of women .
we must not sit back and watch this happen and do nothing about it .
we must put a stop to this new shia family law .
all too often the mothers have simply been murdered .
we should strive to resolve this problem , in spite of cultural differences .
the law also makes it hard to justify the international community's massive military and financial assistance to afghanistan .
our policy must be conceptual but unambiguous .
de mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , afghanistan has had a difficult history .
of course , a modern infrastructure is also needed to enable the country to develop better .
it goes without saying that this review will be conducted entirely under the authority of the afghan government .
the debate is closed .
support for the special court for sierra leone
similarly , a tribunal in tanzania has been prosecuting those responsible for the rwandan genocide of 199in many ways justice delivered in this way is as valuable as financial assistance from the european union .
the un's special court for sierra leone is unable to function .
the question now is what can we still do to guarantee a better outcome ?
this is why , when judging the past , we should not forget the future .
they organised one of the most cruel rebel movements of modern times .
that tool is the court , and the court should be supported , both financially and politically .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
humanitarian situation of camp ashraf residents
the next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions concerning the humanitarian situation of camp ashraf residents .
the spirit of our amendments is quite simple .
we want to present the whole picture of human rights violations and threats in and around camp ashraf .
in short , this is about the individual human rights of the people in camp ashraf .
let us have these people and their human rights in mind when we vote .
people in ashraf are there on a volunteer basis .
this is not a political issue , colleagues it is purely humanitarian and it is very urgent .
the lives of many innocent and harmless people depend on your vote .
i would like to say a few things about it .
the mko has totally isolated all mko members living inside and outside the camp .
these are just a few examples and explanations for the joint amendments which I urge you to support .
it strives for the deportation of those people to iran in order to kill them .
this is their right , their duty , and I can assure you they are fulfilling it correctly .
it was therefore questionable if they should have remained on the eu banned terrorist list .
cs mr president , 30 seconds will be enough for me .
the amendments tabled here in this house are profoundly mistaken .
ladies and gentlemen , we will not close the debate until everyone is seated in silence .
as we all know , in january 2009 the iraqi government took back control of that area .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting

today is 24 april . I have had no answer .

i have recorded what you have said , mr beazley .
i have always been a great fan of opening sporting opportunities for people with disabilities .
i just wanted to put on record my complete support for this resolution .
madam president , I think once again this is one of those reports that many people can welcome .
that clearly shows that we ourselves are not walking the walk when it comes to energy efficiency .
i hope that this will set a precedent for other areas .
mr hamon told me that he is not interested as to whether everyone pays their taxes .
last night he told me I want to know that french people .
the president cut off the speaker 
madam president , this is on the same issue in relation to the free vote .
i wish the legislation success .
i think we all agree that war is a bad thing that is motherhood and apple pie .
therefore , we need better monitoring I think we all agree of the application of community law .
finally , I have one point to make about the iranian regime .
i constantly emphasise that people with disabilities must be treated just as people without disabilities are treated .
there are no guarantees and limitations on such fascist inclined methods , nor can there be any .
that is why the greek communist party voted against the report .
harmonisation is not necessary for prototypes and one off products .
food safety and consumer protection in the eu will thus be reinforced .
in writing . sv it is very important to create sound systems which prevent tax fraud .
nanoparticles have a high surface area and significant surface energy , which give them the following characteristics

needless to say , I completely disagree with extending the application of theblue cardsystem .
no longer are there solitary powers , independent economies or dispensable globalised countries .
that is the problem to which no solution is being given .
that is the road to be taken .
otherwise , we will experience a deep but cyclical crisis , without solving the structural problems in our economies .
we will face rising unemployment and falling demand .
what do we expect , though , when voters see that their views are not taken into consideration anyway ?
until then , this period of stagnation will persist .
secondly , the world's major proliferation in the past decades has not been pyongyang but pakistan .
nowadays , the only way to generate clean energy on a large scale is to use nuclear .
thank you , madam president .

wednesday 
i think that this house should show some measure of humility and some respect for the democratic process .
it would be really irresponsible of us not to be prepared .
on behalf of your colleague mrs kaufmann , I must disagree with you .
this part session is the last opportunity for the current parliament to express its opinion on this issue .
one minute speeches on matters of political importance
the next item is the one minute speeches on matters of political importance .
mr president , thank you for your congratulations on the anniversary of the enlargement of the european union .
it has initiated a new european policy the baltic sea strategy .
here I am repeating the message delivered by my colleague mr bushill matthews .
these fair trial provisions are defined by all of europe and are the rights of every european citizen .
i hope that in the next term parliament will also comment on this matter .
over the last year in poland a further 114 000 men have lost their jobs .
this is not only the effect of the crisis .
slovenia must stop behaving in a petty manner , so that a solution may quickly be found .
i watched in close up 
you are speaking in a free parliament .
it is time to call a halt .
thirteen per cent is not only an unlucky number , it is a downright disgrace .
they must be properly disposed of and handled according to the instructions .
monitoring the negotiations with the pirates cannot be accepted as an adequate policy .
we need greater clarity as to what commitments the european union assumes in such situations .
ro the economic crisis has had a serious impact on the global economy .
it is estimated that all member states will have negative growth rates this year .
their quality of life is also deteriorating .
she went on to make that now famous speech in bruges that sparked opposition to the project .
if you would allow me this comment , I think she was , and is , a great lady .
so margaret thatcher agreed to majority voting in the council this was a great decision .
in germany restrictions have been imposed on the managers of companies subsidised by the state .
mr president , it would be good if the european commission could also set an example in this regard .
your words do not contradict what I said .
i am satisfied that between 1996 and 1999 you were absent from the european parliament .
we are all familiar with the stories about mistreatment of women by the taliban .
i urge you to write to the commissioner to take some action .
i have always tried to allow as many people to speak as possible .
eight human to human transmissions have been reported , in one instance even to a health care worker .
it is clear that we all benefit from our integrated european economy and society .
but we should not focus unduly on the negative aspects of these events .
europe means solidarity in standing together to face this threat .
the second issue that I want to mention is that of antiviral drugs .
an obligation was introduced for the member states to have an adequate quota .
subsequently , nothing much was decided .
what measures have been taken , and are these actually coordinated ?
i have my doubts .
i am not blaming the commission , then .
where was the council , though ?
it is hard to do anything with this council .
yet I agree with mr trakatellis and mr maaten .
it is time for solidarity .
therefore , the europe of solidarity must take action , as must the europe of communication .
the concern is for next winter .
in germany , I feel that I have been provided with sufficient information on how I should behave .
it is the member states that are responsible for providing this information .
we should also take this opportunity to remind them that they need to fulfil their duty to provide information .
congratulations !
that concludes thecatch the eyeperiod .
member of the commission . mr president , I thank members for their contributions .
many speakers mentioned antivirals and the sufficiency of stocks .
equal treatment between men and women engaged in a self employed capacity pregnant workers debate 
their fate has been a matter of concern for the european parliament since the 1990s .
why table amendments that are vague and legally unsound ?
i call on the alde group to withdraw these amendments .
i assume that there is a misunderstanding between the shadow rapporteur of that group and mr cocilovo .
however , the most innovative proposal in relation to the european commission's proposal concerns paternity leave .
family life is one of the reasons why there are more unemployed women than men .
i am delighted with the progress made on both of the legislative proposals tabled by the commission .
this significant principle has been established by the european court of justice .
furthermore , this amendment would greatly complicate the possibility of reaching agreement with the council .
the increase from six to twelve months is therefore simply good sense .
this issue is not just about women it is also about society .
i do not think that paternity leave has a place in this directive .
however , if it must remain part of it , it must be more flexible .
we support the motion , although we do not think it goes far enough .
at a time of drastic demographic collapse in europe , every form of support for the family is valuable .
in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity individual member states should always be looking for better solutions .
i would also like to draw attention to two problems .
against this background , the occupational safety regulations relating to mothers deserve particular attention .
it would not be appropriate if parliament waded into the discussion like a bull in a china shop .
i am unable to support the proposed amendment 22 , especially the second part of it .
like the international labour organization ilo , the commission has now proposed 18 weeks .
my second point concerns parental , paternity and adoption leave .
i think that mrs lulling has done an excellent job on this .
in certain countries , maternity leave is paid out of tax revenue .
in this respect , companies are called on to help to ensure a family friendly working environment .
it is not enough to say that we defend these rights .
sk motherhood is the greatest miracle which god has bestowed on women .
so there are tools other than the directive , in my view .
allow me to add a few words on maternity protection , because our position has been very badly misunderstood .
it is a conservative and unacceptable position , which is out of touch with reality .
commissioner , I have not talked about parental leave , but about paternity leave .
is the commission actually trying to remain out of touch with the reality that already exists in member states ?
i am very surprised at this position , commissioner .
written statements rule 142 
in writing . even during a crisis , equal treatment should be high on the political agenda .
in this way , women would have an efficient tool for contributing to the development of the economy .
i very much regret that the two institutions did not succeed in finding any common ground .
the council in particular did not move an inch on the question of the opt out .
the council was not prepared to accept this restriction .
it is an indisputable fact that the opt out is used today by 15 of the 27 eu member states .
the council wanted to prevent this but parliament has ruled otherwise .
too many member states simply insisted on using individual exceptions and on retaining this provision in the directive .
this is a lost opportunity .
this is not true they are fooling themselves .
the council did not want to put an end to the opt out .
it took away doctorsrights and it took away their working conditions .
what is more , they have accused us of doing this during an election period .
applause 
why should someone not be allowed to earn overtime if that is what they choose to do ?
he has stabbed the social democrats in the back .
they do things their own way , including the way they work .
i agree , and I for one insist on being more representative of the citizens .
it is regrettable that agreement will not be reached .
no doubt there may be a few more , and that is not a good situation .
i can also tell you that we made some progress during the negotiations .
i can confirm that there is actually a majority in favour of removing the opt out .
the opt out that you want still exists in practice , as opposition to progress has carried it through .
fortunately , the large majority in the european parliament said no .
therefore limiting working times is all the more necessary , bearing in mind the need for workersfreedoms .
the responsibility for the failure therefore lies fairly and squarely with the council .
parliament has done its duty .
madam president , it is really bizarre that the council should blame parliament for the breakdown in these talks .
in practice this is , therefore , stealing the employee's time .
to require workers to systematically work overtime and put in long working weeks is to destroy jobs .
we are only trying to adapt it to the current economy and the global economic situation .
we are not living in the 20th century .
can you see this mobile phone , can you see these computers ?
the council agreed to this but it was still not passed .
ladies and gentlemen , the debate featured arguments that have been used many times before and for good reason .
a directive was approved in 1993 which accepted the exception .
since that point , the number of member states using the opt out has risen sharply .
the reason for that is quite simple .
i must state quite clearly that the information which we were given in the trialogue was quite different .
i would like to make it clear that we did receive this information .
the results were quite clear 15 votes in favour , none against and five abstentions .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 142 
agenda see minutes
i am grateful that commissioner tajani can support them .
the paper intimates that self employed drivers work 86 hour weeks .
over half own the vehicle they drive .
they therefore do everything themselves they maintain their vehicles and do their own accounts .
in any case , how would compliance with such a regulation be monitored ?
it is vitally important to aid employment and entrepreneurship during an economic crisis .
poor transposition of and compliance with the legislation cannot be a reason to relax the rules .
the current directive removes a fundamental principle of the free market , namely , entrepreneurship and support for it .
including them in the new directive will actually destroy their entrepreneurial drive .
adopting such a decision would have an adverse impact on the european economy .
the definition of night work is also of great practical significance .
forty thousand people die every year on the roads of the european union .
large numbers of people are injured or permanently disabled .
all of this is simply accepted , as if it were an act of god .
everyone knows that a disproportionate number of lorries is involved in serious road accidents .
madam president , we need to reject this proposal from the commission for three clear reasons .
driving time represents only half on average of the working time of a driver .
we need to reject this proposal from the commission .
now we face the practical issue of whether we should support them or not .
we shall not achieve this by raising obstacles to work .
the vote will take place on tuesday 5 may 200parliament's estimates of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 2010 debate 
in some areas savings have already been identified and improvements proposed .
i firmly believe that if we improve medium term budget planning and increase its transparency we will achieve efficiencies .
expenditure on purchasing and renting buildings is one of the main administrative cost items of eu institutions .
just over three years ago the institutions were using total space in excess of 2 million square metres .
we can achieve annual savings of millions of euros by improving cooperation between european institutions .
we are keeping our budget below the 20 % limit on appropriations for administrative costs .
the vote will take place on tuesday 5 may 200trade in seal products debate 
but , of course , there are exceptions .
if people in any of our member states wish to hunt , they can still continue to hunt .
what they cannot do is take commercial gain from the results of that hunt .
after our exchange of views , we were all in tears .
the citizens can now be sure that seal products will no longer be available on the market .
i can imagine that the relevant negotiations with the member states were not always plain sailing .
both these advisers informed us that the legal basis used was wrong .
that is what I remember .
i hope that my fellow members realise exactly what they are doing .
we are simply relocating the problem .
you have solved nothing .
i can see no self satisfaction in that .
it is much appreciated . 
better information is required , as consumers should be able to make a more informed choice .
we are , of course , also following parliament's written statement which clearly demanded the ban .
this makes it very clear that there is a legal foundation for what we are doing .
there are foundations for our actions .
only if a clear distinction is made will the inuits have the opportunity to sell anything .
seal hunting occurs in sweden , but it is controlled protective hunting .
the compromise that has now been proposed is better than the original motion .
let us hope that I am wrong .
this is not only gruesome but also totally senseless .
i say to all meps please stop this disaster and vote against this proposal .
sv madam president , I am very pleased indeed that we have finally reached this point .
the rules are not complied with out on the ice .
i would like to thank all my fellow members who have made this possible .
who has anything against that ?
consequently , what is being done here is a disaster for greenland .
treating poor people like this is beneath us .
however , I need an assurance from the commissioner .
perhaps I could ask a direct question through the chair to the commissioner .
the issue is whether they are killed humanely or not .
i am very pleased that it is possible tonight to reach a first reading agreement on this highly sensitive file .
regarding the issue that mrs doyle referred to , this will be dealt with in the implementing measures .
as with all compromises , somebody or everybody will perhaps be a little disappointed by something or other .
we cannot deal with the hunting from here , not the hunting that occurs in third countries .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on tuesday 5 may 200written statements rule 142 
marketing of some pharmaceutical products made from seals , such as dietary supplements , will not be allowed .
thank you very much .
protection of animals used for scientific purposes debate 
by working together we have been able to come up with what I believe is a good compromise .
animal testing is a highly controversial area and involves a moral dilemma .
is it ever right to test on animals in order to potentially save the lives of humans ?
the omission of definitions of a severity classification was a glaring hole in the whole proposal .
it is also a step forward for medical research .
we also want to see animal tests reduced .
however , european citizens quite rightly demand that the best and more effective medicines are available .
however , the liberal group appears to be trying to drive a coach and horses through this agreement .
i am certain that the dialogue which ensues will be constructive .
moreover , numerous scientific agencies made a significant contribution to this procedure .
however , there is no evidence that there will be any such drain to non eu countries .
we know that this is the case from the public reaction .
you have extended the directive to cover all animal species , not just mammals .
the commission has also effectively resolved the highly controversial issue of tests on non human primates .
unfortunately , many details of the commission proposal have been amended by the votes in the committees .
however , it is a pity that article 15 has not got through .
we must provide a set of values , because that is our job .
this is about protecting laboratory animals and not about business profits .
these procedures are unethical and barbaric .
finally , the use of non human primates in experiments must be phased out completely and rapidly .
the commission can accept numerous amendments in full , in part or in principle .
they also include proposals for regular review of the use of non human primates at european union level .
we are right to keep the momentum going .
this is regrettable because we need to come forward with a sensible proposal in the end .
we do not deliver this report lightly .
we have put serious work into it and we have good compromises .
this demonstrates the commission's commitment towards the end goal of the abolition of animal experimentation .
there remains a huge gap in the development of alternative , non animal testing methods .
public opinion polls tend to support this approach and they cannot be ignored .
ship source pollution and penalties for infringements debate 
in conclusion , I wish to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work he has done on this report .
unfortunately , the subject is always largely ignored in the interim .
i too would like to congratulate mr de grandes pascual .
this is why , above all , attention must be focused on monitoring .
consumer rights debate 
are we asking consumers to give up some of the rights they have under national law ?
our questions therefore focus on the details of specific areas where we would like to see further work .
i was delighted you mentioned the house of lords because I was also going to reflect on that .
the council and parliament should now incorporate these three central points into a fully harmonised proposal .
consumers often pay for the services of these consumer groups before deciding on a purchase .
this helps these organisations to remain independent .
following the expansion of the eu it is all the more difficult and complex to be a consumer .
the european consumer centre and the europa diary can also help consumers considerably .
recommendation to the european commission in complaint 185 / 2005 / elb short presentation 
nothing less and nothing more than that .
our opinion was that our position would be recognised by the ombudsman .
consequently the commission returned to its previous practice .
this approach also supports an active policy of training of young conference interpreters .
but the commissioner has failed to make a single mention of the ombudsman's recommendation .
thank you to all the staff and thank you to all the interpreters , whatever age they may be .
the vote will take place tomorrow tuesday , 5 may 2009 .
closure of the sitting
the most important thing is that it makes the package robust for the next decade .
there will be plenty of briefing about that afterwards .
i just want to give you a sense of what we have achieved and what we are looking for .
in this directive we have significantly improved the rights of consumers and users in the electronic space .
above all , they are entitled to have their data in the electronic communications space protected .
all of those are included in this proposal .
i look forward to your support for this tomorrow because it is so important for all our futures .
so , thank you very much .
the vote of the european parliament is very good news for consumers all over europe .
it is very important for our industry .
i welcome parliament's strengthening of the rules concerning the use of cookies and similar devices .
this is the first time an obligation of this kind has been introduced at european level .
i have to make two declarations in response to points raised by parliamentarians .
many thanks , commissioner , for this excellent collaboration with the commission as well .
that is a good sign .
i would like to single out what in my view is the most important point .
by we , I mean young people , who communicate worldwide .
it creates the necessary legal framework , so that businesses can invest in the expansion of broadband networks nationwide .
the risks in building the new networks have been distributed satisfactorily and fairly .
what else will the telecom package regulate ?
let me make two points .
there have been some important achievements as a result of the negotiations with the council .
things will perhaps be better in one member state than in another .
as parliament we should do better than this .
it is about interaction , freedom of expression , creativity and creative zest .
in so doing , I will vote for democracy and an economy with opportunities for everyone .
it includes no specific proposals to improve the legal supply of cultural goods .
finally , it scorns the presumption of innocence and the right to defend oneself .
to conclude I would once more like to refer to my fellow member mrs trautmann's report .
we need judicial control before net access is blocked .
at this very moment , mr sarkozy is challenging the european institutions over the future of the internet .
what is our response going to be ?
are we going to remain silent and not answer ?
information given to consumers in contracts alone is not sufficient .
national powers should have a role in investigating any restriction that service providers impose .
the president cut off the speaker 
the telecommunications industry is one of europe's leading dynamic industries .
such groups include the elderly and the disabled .
it needs to be protected and diversified .
we already decided earlier on that information is a civil right .
our knowledge is simply insufficient for that .
however , meps were anxious to ensure that democratic accountability over use of the spectrum was maintained .
i am afraid that private deals by leaders behind closed doors are not the way to make eu legislation .
i regret that this occurred .
madam president , I have a few observations .
that should be enough .
that is quite an important contribution .
when changing provider , consumers must be able to keep their own number within a day .
they must be ensured unimpeded access to means of telecommunication .
however , on this last point , I have to say that the democratic movement's delegation was disappointed .
that tells us how much importance they attach to fundamental rights .
the right to a judicial process must not be called into question on any pretext .
i have received hundreds of letters on this matter , and not only from poland .
this will also make an important contribution to an innovative society , and we are grateful for that .
in my view , this is an essential principle which must be observed .
nevertheless , I have a problem with this package .
i have to say I find this extremely irritating .
in my eyes , it would be a crying shame if this amendment were not adopted .
we do want a compromise with the council , of course , but not at all costs .
the president cut off the speaker 
my congratulations to the rapporteurs and to the commission .
this package includes numerous documents .
improved competition must be central .
that is why I share mrs trautmann's point of view .
who could have imagined a few years ago that we would now have services like bbc iplayer or youtube ?
at the same time , this does not eliminate all threats to the internet .
there are many other issues that will continue to be discussed , and I look forward to those debates .
however , I would like to say clearly that citizens cannot have an unlimited right to unrestricted illegal downloading !
this is not a point that can be negotiated here .
it is not the french model .
allow me to answer some of the questions which have been raised .
it is already possible for several companies to share the investment risk under the current rules .
the second question concerns data breaches .
it has been a very constructive debate .
they are important for every consumer .
our task as regulators is to allow that dynamism , that innovation , to continue .
it is that sense of dynamism and urgency that we need to move forward .
let us move on from here and look towards the future .
therefore , I call on the european commission to take the greatest care when transposing this telecoms package .
i believe that thousands of europeans want to know why .
it will be significantly easier for consumers to obtain information from their service provider and change service providers .
precontract information must indicate whether a consumer is tied to a contract for a specific period of time .
i shall comment on just two issues which have caused serious confrontation .
it is undoubtedly very successful and recognisable and has made a huge contribution towards energy savings .
it certainly also has numerous problems .
however , 1992 is some time ago .
there are , however , two points that I must strongly oppose .
it must be stressed that advertising is key for free , independent , diverse and high quality media .
our solution is to give producers and retailers the possibility of providing information on specific energy consumption saving aspects .
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur .
i will continue to support us having an interesting debate , even during second reading .
this decision is wise and right .
therefore , in my opinion the commission's proposal is the smarter , more sensible one .
i have followed labelling legislation for the last 15 years .
it obstructed the updating at the end of the 1990s .
a to g is easy to understand .
we need decisions based on facts .
member of the commission . madam president , it is difficult .
industry is also looking for more energy efficient appliances to produce and place on the market .
the second was about the eco design measure for fridges and tv sets .
the report does not at this stage give a complete solution .
thank you for the debate .

animal testing is a highly controversial and emotional area which does involve a moral dilemma .
we had a good compromise in the agriculture committee and it should not be picked apart at this stage .
all are examples of the benefits of animal research .

mr president , I am grateful to you for calling me .
the truth is , however , that the people are not really represented in this chamber .
mr president , I welcome the adoption of this report .
they are not an endangered species even the wwf says so .
then again , democracy is not strictly rational .
people are not always calculating machines .
i do not know .
that company has shown that it is possible to develop alternatives that work .
it is possible to go further .
we have only made a small step .
we need to do much more .
i have received a number of letters on this issue and constituents across my region express their dismay .
i abstained on the amended proposal , because I feel that on this issue no compromises are necessary .
thank you .
lv thank you , mr president .
i voted in favour .
since everything is voted on in a single vote , we were not able to oppose these proposals .
for the above reasons , we have voted against the report in question .
improving the quality of our ambient air remains a major challenge to be addressed .
in writing . lt transparency is a fundamental principle of the european union .
it now falls to the soon to be elected parliament to give its verdict during the new parliamentary term .
should we exclude all self employed drivers from this directive ?
it is a victory for road safety and social europe .
there is no such regulation in any other sector .
this decision will have an irreversible adverse impact on the european economy's competitiveness .
small carriers and sole traders will be hardest hit .
in this case , we have chosen to make a judgment based on the overall situation .
the text of the regulation allows for several exceptions which in some cases are necessary .
it is also a source of satisfaction to the 425 meps who signed the written declaration on this subject .
in writing . I am pleased today that we voted to ban the eu trade in seal products .
the proposal to permit the import of seal products subject to a labelling requirement did not receive our support .
in my opinion , a total ban is the right approach .
regulation has not , therefore , curbed the success of this industry .
sadly the european parliament missed the opportunity to take a strong line on animal protection today .
in writing . sv this report recommends the amendment of an existing directive on ship source pollution .
in writing . it I voted in favour .
any advert must indicate energy consumption and energy savings .
member states can adopt incentive measures , including tax credits for products which are extremely energy efficient .

i am working hard !
it is obvious that any attempt to put pressure on them might prove counterproductive .
we have already begun doing so , both at eu level and more globally .
we have recently reaffirmed the existing employment guidelines and adopted country specific recommendations .
there was a summit yesterday between the eu and japan in prague .
this essential ballot will be held against a background of real difficulties for many of our citizens .
our response to the crisis must be founded on our fundamental values of responsibility , solidarity and social justice .
all europeans of heart and conviction must be prepared to get involved .
parliament has shown its determination to achieve concrete results for citizens .
we have to speak clearly and with conviction to the electorate about this europe of results .
europe needs it .
inevitably , the main focus of the european council will again be the economic crisis .
here , again , I would like europe to be the first to move at global level .
we will discuss the employment summit in more detail later .
our response to the crisis cannot be limited to technical measures to address regulatory problems .
the treaty of lisbon stipulates this move , which would be a positive development .
the credibility of the european union is at stake .
the european people's party christian democrats and european democrats seem to be behind it .
again , I would like to come back to your consultation , which you can have today .
if you compare both papers , there is a huge difference .
mr nyrup rasmussen will express this clearly and articulately .
mass youth unemployment !
the time has come to make clear how we will proceed .
president in office , your presidency has not been bad .
for all that lisbon matters , it will not define this european election campaign .
not waiting to react or to respond to events elsewhere but leading the charge as to what will happen .
one thing is very clear the european council did not want to put its money on the table .
however , it was not to become a major joint summit on the rising unemployment in europe .
it could almost have been done on purpose !
it represents a significant challenge to the present single currency system .
as mentioned previously , the situation is particularly acute in ireland , greece and a number of other states .
last but not least , it is rejected by the president of your own country , václav klaus .
i therefore cannot understand why you are now lowering yourself to the same practices .
however , it should also look at how the eu can assist enterprise in the longer term .
that is why europe cannot be allowed to go down a socialist route this june .
the economic downturn has caused the socialists to show their true colours .
they believe politicians should dictate how many hours you can work .
nothing epitomises thepolitician knows bestattitude better than the recent debate over the working time directive .
in britain , 3 million people use the opt out .
nothing !
but can I remind you that an unemployment level of 11.1 % next year is 27 million unemployed people ?
can I put the following proposal to you ?
at the same time , imperialist aggression and the militarisation of the european union are being stepped up .
what have the monopolies gained ?
i was pleased to hear both deputy prime minister vondra and president barroso speak about targets .
i would also add that some people are now challenging the sustainability of the european social model .
the union's czech presidency would have better served europe's ambitions by organising a full employment summit .
one of the most crucial aspects of the eastern partnership is going to be visa freedom .
a successful eastern partnership , however , needs determination on our side and a positive openness .
it is vital to motivate our partners to make a full commitment to european values and rules .
sv thank you , madam president , commission president barroso , mr vondra .
you must be joking .
what kind of text would this have been if we had not brought it to your attention ?
you have missed the point mr barroso .
we therefore need an environmentally compatible streamlining of transport policy .
only in this way can we avoid unilateral rules which distort competition to the cost of the european economy .
if we want to be successful in copenhagen , we must also discuss an environmentally compatible transport policy .
this is a crucial issue for democracy and I think that the president of parliament should defend it .
finally , mr vondra , I would like to congratulate you on your presidency .
this includes my country , poland .
we do not want a return to nationalism .
we particularly need the political will to respond to the current economic situation .
it is a matter for the irish people to decide whether we ratify the lisbon treaty or not .
i hope we do , and I will work very hard to achieve that .
i would urge him to revise his line .
we cannot have a european union that ignores that .
we are now certain that it is not sufficient .
the presidency will meet with you here at the end of june .
i have no doubt that it will contribute to a successful conclusion of the czech presidency .
in the context of the current economic crisis , this is the most important challenge for all of us .
jean claude juncker talked about this on monday yesterday before the ecofin meeting started in the eurogroup .
applause 
that is a strategic mission to promote stability , well being and prosperity in our eastern neighbourhood .
going back to the june council , many of you were talking about the future commission .
i said clearly that we , as the presidency , will consult the european parliament immediately after the elections .
now I would leave you with my personal testament .
applause 
however , I have not heard much about any of this yet today .
it is affecting the emerging markets .
however , I cannot respond to this challenge at present .
that is not the european parliament's fault , nor is it the commission's fault .
that is a mistake .
now there is something that would be worth achieving during the next parliamentary term .
however , there is no point asking the european institutions for what they cannot provide at this stage .
i myself am a party man .
i think that is important for the future .
let us be clear about the truth the czech republic is facing a political problem .
however , it is also thanks to the czech presidency .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 142 
eu was established as an attempt not only to assure peace but also as a tool for cooperation .
we must maintain european solidarity while adhering to rules and principles that stem from the eu treaty .
eu must make maximum use of the single market and stand up for open trade in the economic downturn .
we must also look at strengthening and restructuring the labour market so as to prepare it for the future .
these workshops have enabled us to focus , with the social partners , on the key areas of concern .
the newly unemployed should not be allowed to become long term unemployed .
this week's summit will certainly need to take into account this important goal .
we cannot and will not seek to push job creation for a few .
however , we now urgently need to evaluate its impact on employment .
the march european council decided on a more restrained format , to my great regret .
it should draw its essence from our most fundamental values social justice and solidarity .
secondly , europe really can change things and make a contribution .
we can also act as a reception centre for ideas , as a laboratory .
the input of this parliament into that process has been most valuable .
i would like to point to four key issues that have emerged from these events .
finally , upgrading skills and matching labour market needs .
i want this summit to yield concrete , tangible results .
europe is not only an economic and political project .
the egf is the baby here .
they risk being forgotten and that is something we have to be very much aware of .
the report also says that it is important that member states should be considering a minimum wage .
social security systems do not always respond to that very well .
will we finally approve a minimum wage tomorrow ?
the european citizens have been demanding a strong social europe for years .
we in the committee on culture and education have contributed via this opinion .
there is also a need to promote university business cooperation .
lifelong learning is also very important .
the second is to put a clear european project on the table for the g20 summit in the spring .
we are taking a step forwards , but we still have a lot to do .
several of the leaders will not attend this meeting .
the commission wanted a summit .
is this an unavoidable development ?
i have just one question .
has this report really been prepared for the people and will the aid get through to them ?
it is hardly used or not used at all for the other intended measures .
you will say that this is a matter for the member statesgovernments , but I say no !
that document mentioned how the transition to low carbon economies would have an important impact on employment .
how social is it if the family is deprived of some of the nice things in life ?
how social is it to overturn the way national parliaments have tried to protect workers ?
he wants to know if he can utilise the knowledge that he acquired while he was in work .
poverty promotes social exclusion and restricts access to education and health care .
we have often criticised the fact that the economic pillar is overvalued compared to the other two .
the social agenda has significantly strengthened the social pillar .
we can only hope that the council and the commission will also take these demands seriously .
it madam president , ladies and gentlemen , I will focus on the globalisation adjustment fund .
madam president , there are structural weaknesses that are a heavy burden and prevent us from moving forward .
we must rid ourselves of that burden and implement the social agenda .
ro the european union has been admired for a long time for its social model .
we need a european solidarity and cohesion policy , backed up with specific legislative , fiscal and financial measures .
i am delighted we are having this key debate .
we will really miss you and be thinking of you .
this half day troika is a pathetic response .
i should also like to thank mr silva peneda for including this in his report .
this decision has to be left up to the worker .
i think the debate was very important and constructive , just with regard to the merits of the issues .
however , a number of things have changed in comparison with the earlier crisis .
however , I wish to say that the prague summit is an exceptional event .
it is being prepared in an exceptional way .
it also provides a good basis for actions to be taken after the crisis .
some specific questions were raised in the debate , which I would like to answer .
mrs juknevičienwas concerned that money from the fund often fails to reach those who need it .
i think it should be stressed that our line is absolutely clear .
the egf is also part of the european social model .
he was right to say ,a stitch in time saves nine.
that is quite clear , and that is not its purpose .
member states still have some responsibility .
the comment by mr naranjo escobar was very accurate and concerns a task for the future .
at this stage of the debate , I want to make three comments .
my third comment concerns the problem of trust .
thank you very much .
the debate is closed .
what the government leaders and politicians need is to address the situation with imagination and concrete measures .
the best way is to stimulate the creation of new jobs .
moreover , europe has to invest in education , especially in life long learning .
the next commission should assess the transposition of the posting directive in member states .
it shows that we are a long way from the objective of making the union a europe for citizens .
question time commission 
particular emphasis is placed on ensuring support for developing countries which have committed to the good governance principles .
es thank you very much for your answer , commissioner .
they affect wealth creation and do not stimulate investment .
member of the commission . well , there is a treaty and the treaty is very clear .
the commission awaits the response of the european parliament to the approach proposed in its communication with particular interest .
what is the difference ?
in fact , I am very surprised that this debate is being held after the recent disaster in italy .
on our initiative several warning devices have been installed there .
mr pirker added yet another and , of course , we shall find others .
in particular , there are specific provisions for nuclear installations and there is the seveso ii directive for industry .
so we addressed as a matter of urgency the electricity grids and interconnection between member countries .
that is why it was not included , not because I do not believe in it .
i have noted carefully what you have said .
subject nuclear power stations
so whatever project is being proposed , we are not discriminating between member states .
so , we cannot go with a regional approach .
what is the commission doing to support cities like cork in their efforts to promote sustainable energy ?
in 2008 we supported the initiative from cities to have a covenant of mayors .
this can be as much as 4 % of the total regional fund allocation .
thank you to commissioner piebalgs for his response .
without this bottom up approach , we will fail to use the opportunities that exist .
subject the economic crisis and avoiding protectionism
can any progress be reported with regards to completing the doha round ?
the g20 leaders expressed their renewed commitment to reaching a swift conclusion of the doha round .
this is an important component that we should factor in .
the free trade agreement with korea would create new market access in many areas of interest to eu exporters .
the free trade agreement would also present a useful point of reference for other negotiations .
it is estimated that 650 000 korean cars would sell in europe per annum .
this plant is currently mothballed and the workers are on standby .
member of the commission . I understand your concerns about the situation in the car industry .
a swedish court before which a case was brought by the ombudsman has just given a similar ruling .
the commission has planned another meeting for the 14th of this month .
thank you , therefore , for your answer and we look forward to seeing what happens next .
i know that you are of italian origin , so once again , thank you .
i was recently in amsterdam and watched klm dealing with delayed passengers by rebooking them on a self check in .
the staff systematically , without asking the passengers , declined the compensation and assistance which they were entitled to .
can we have some monitoring by the commission ?
can we have some people actually at airports looking at what the airlines do ?
because , frankly , it seems to me that it has become a joke .
i hope that the commission's work will improve the situation and provide citizens with the answers they expect .
how does the commission assess the prospects for future privatisations of airlines in the eu ?
i would like to draw your attention to this in particular , as progress here is still very slow .
on 31 march , the european commission published two invitations to submit ten t proposals .
questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing see annex .
a mixture of red and white wine in the guise of rosé ?
the european union market is starting to be targeted by these third country blends .
we have often heard in this chamber that we must guarantee the european wine market a certain future .
however , I am from bordeaux .
here we have a rosé wine .
other members have said as much , that food counterfeiting will reign ever more .
we therefore say to you look at what is already happening in some countries.
today , one fifth of rosé production involves blending .
i would maintain that the commission does not have to systematically bleed the other four fifths .
i completely agree with mrs laperrouze .
madam president , commissioner , I am delighted to see you here again today .
i urge you to do this for the sake of the quality of european wine production .
now we are considering the idea of colouring white wine with red wine to make rosé wine .
if it is an industrial product , then it can be blended , like a wine coca cola .
fr madam president , commissioner , when I arrived here I was extremely annoyed .
i remember that speech very clearly .
watch out on 19 june .
secondly and importantly , the reputation of european wine will be damaged yet again .
we also adopted the addition of sugar to wine .
nor shall we have the courage to do so now .
europe can only assert itself with the very high quality wines which it has .
i therefore implore that we get off the slippery slope of these decisions .
i sometimes wonder , who is guiding whom here ?
traditionally our wine making has evolved in europe .
would that be possible in future for these low grade wines ?
they are linked to our traditional producers and we set great store by this for the future .
therefore , we ask for your support .
moreover , no one has ever asked you to authorise this oenological practice .
this is what we are asking you .
how do you expect our fellow citizens to understand such a stance on the part of the european commission ?
organise a european competition to name this something else if you think it should be legalised .
therefore , there is too much ambiguity .
so we are on exactly the same wavelength here .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 142 
the next item is the commission statement on democratic process in turkey .
political pluralism is an integral part of any democracy .
the commission also continues to follow closely the closure case against the dtp currently pending in the constitutional court .
that is an essential part of the process of democratisation of turkey .
careful reporting has an important role to play here .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this is the last plenary sitting of this legislative period .
my fellow member mr öger has just said that turkey is a priority .
it is the first copenhagen criterion that is in question .
there are varying opinions as to how turkey has developed .
turkey is an important neighbour , an important , respected nato partner .
we would be grateful if this could be documented persuasively in the next legislative period .
it is a bad thing that the prime minister has called on the population to stop buying certain newspapers .
the scope for finding a political solution to the kurdish issue has been drastically curtailed .
another 14 year old , who was fleeing a police gas attack , drowned after falling into a river .
hundreds of democratically elected politicians and activists of the dtp have been imprisoned , including three party leaders .
the list goes on .
the european institutions and the turkish authorities should learn from this wisdom at long last .
we have seen the murders of priests or missionaries in the past two years , we have infinite problems .
cyprus is still under turkish military occupation , in defiance of international law .
de mr president , I would like to respond to what mr lagendijk has said .
once again I would like to ask the commission a specific question .
if no , why is it no longer concerned ?
as I said , this is after all about the first copenhagen criterion , the political criterion .
there has been critical but constructive support for our engagement with turkey in a very critical period .
the debate is closed .
we kill billions of animals for meat , for skins and for a variety of economic needs .
by protecting animals from inhuman treatment we protect our own humanity .
there were several areas of controversy .
the committee members were of the opinion that such a ban would be unworkable .
the spirit of saint francis of assisi is present in this chamber .
the commission suggests that subsidiarity should be maintained in this area .
therefore the commission believes that prior stunning should always be performed when pigs or lambs are slaughtered outside slaughterhouses .
where this has been properly implemented , it has provided good results .
animals are also killed in huge numbers outside slaughterhouses in order to control the spread of disease .
transparency , which means proper reporting , is therefore essential .
we have found a balance between religious tradition and animal welfare that most people are happy with .
i do not believe this is fair .
that is why we propose that the relevant authority be responsible for ensuring the rules are correctly applied .
what should we do to change this ?
on religious slaughter , I think the commissioner is absolutely right .
my congratulations .
the european regulations introduced in the area of animal protection are among the most stringent in the world .
i believe that animal welfare standards in europe are absolutely paramount to the fact that we produce high quality meat .
i think the commission must make up its mind .
freedom of religion is one thing , causing unnecessary pain to animals and violating hygiene rules is another .
the commission proposal introduces important innovations which I hope you can support .
in addition , meat import certificates must confirm that eu standards have been respected in the exporting establishments .
i thank parliament and its rapporteur for their support .
the first of these is money .
community means are essential here in order to achieve the objectives that have been set .
i am glad that there is approval for these proposals in this chamber .
the debate is closed .
so there are some innovative features that should make our debates a little more lively .
so there are a lot of interesting things in here .
that is a rather sensible improvement to our procedures .
in our parliament , the committees have very strong roles .
to his credit I must say that this is the second modification of the rules of procedure .
i would also like to commend amendment 68 concerning the recasting procedure .
you cannot change the requirements in order to keep certain groups , persons or attitudes from having influence .
fortunately , the legal service rejected this .
consequently , my group , too , has tabled amendments that would make all voting electronic .
this would enable us to avoid mistakes and at the same time ensure that we have a quorum .
the socialist group in the european parliament will support this report .
initiative reports will have to take second place legislation needs to come first .
this is excellent .
this reform is essential .
fr mr president , although excellent , mr corbett's report unfortunately includes a serious error .
our aim is to provide high quality parliamentary services .
why ?
now the committee is proposing that all final votes on legislative proposals be conducted as roll call votes .
and quite rightly , too !
this report was actually split into two .
secondly , when it comes to amendments , these are now prohibited for own initiative reports .
i think that is also a welcome adjustment to the procedures that we have at the moment .
may I also confirm that lots of new ideas have come from other members .
i had grave reservations about the amendment that was submitted in the committee .
i am happy to support the one that has been submitted to plenary .
i am going to talk about petitions .
we have established the right to withdraw from a petition .
we have therefore tried to simplify things by giving a kind of admissibility incentive .
the same holds true if confidentiality is requested during discussions .
it will of course retain this right provided that there is no objection by the conference of presidents .
the electronic register has been retained .
the information collected will naturally be supplied to the commission , the council and the petitioner .
you can understand both sides .
i really have no understanding of how she could reach such a conclusion .
it is a compromise .
this will probably be the last report that mr onesta will make here in parliament .
i would like to make a few remarks about his last report .
lastly , I would like to say that I agree with our chairman , mr leinen .
mr leinen , you are absolutely right it was a slip of the tongue .
we simply opted to strengthen coordination in this scenario .
i will continue my linguistic explanations with mr botopoulos's question .
i think that , with those clarifications made , we can conclude , mr president .
the quicker the money gets to the farmers and regions , the greater the benefit from this financial assistance .
i would also like to thank the sector organisations for the proposals they made .
this would really be a very opportune moment to assess the current situation and reconsider many energy problems .
this risk remains high to this day .
this is clearly the case here too .
we correctly rectified this in the negotiations and in the trialogue of 2 april .
we need more flexibility , more manoeuvrability in the multiannual budgetary procedure .
we expect nothing less !
we are confident that the projects will be implemented as scheduled .
in particular , the gas crises needed a quick response .
the proposal forms part of the european economic recovery plan .
fellow members , our european economies and our infrastructure depend on good access to energy .
this is why I would like to stress once again the need for a common european union energy policy .
i would like to end by congratulating the rapporteur for her fine work .
we have had months of sometimes intense negotiations with the eu council .
where , finally , is the highly proclaimed solidarity across the european union ?
a keynesian recovery is needed to respond to a cyclical downturn , but this crisis is structural .
the tool , then , is inadequate .
firstly , an energy market is not relevant .
over a large distance , energy loss is proportionate to the distance travelled .
the likelihood of breakdowns and outages grows with the geographical complexity of the network .
the measures implemented and financed from this package should therefore help prevent a repeat of this crisis .
ladies and gentlemen , I am coming to the end of my political career .
it has been a pleasure to work with you all .
farmers are naturally aware of their responsibility towards society .
with this in mind , I wish the european union all the best for the future .
applause 
marilyn monroe once saidlead me not into temptation , I can find it myself.
i would like to thank the rapporteur , who has done a good job , and my fellow members .
that is the only really convincing form of politics that we can present to our citizens .
we need equivalent living conditions in towns and cities and in the country .
cutting subsidies is certainly the wrong approach if we wish to safeguard vital rural areas and lower middleclass structures .
it is very important that we deal with thisfive billionpackage .
broadband in particular means that lots of small businesses can be developed in the rural areas .
what has happened to the eur 15 billion announced via new actions and entrusted to the eib ?
that will not be permitted by parliament .
moreover , the council still has to agree to release these margins .
the measures put forward will undoubtedly be useful , but the funding still remains insecure .
what I would like to know is what are we giving priority to ?
thank you .
above all , there is not much left over for rural areas .
it also entails a transfer of funds from the agricultural budget to rural development .
above all , it is left to the discretion of the member states to create compensation programmes .
on this point , we must all act jointly in a very responsible manner .
thank you .
however , once again , I feel obliged to express two reservations in this regard .
so thank you , commissioner , for your accessibility and cooperation .
it should be understood that european diplomats spent several weeks debating the specific shape of the package .
the fact is that some of the issues remain unresolved .
and voters would surely count that against us come the next gas crisis .
it is very good .
lt I would like to talk about the macroeconomic impact of this package .
this package is important because it boosts our common market's liquidity .
such a package is needed not as some sort of subsidy or aid .
however , I think that more must be invested in modernising the infrastructure for producing and transporting electrical energy .
cooperation between member states on energy issues has been rather complicated .
mr paparizov mentioned bulgaria .
the question is why it was not developed .
you also need companies to deal with this .
it is also important to underline the solidarity in the distribution of the money .
so broadband is one of the issues for the future .
this demonstrates that we are reacting in a sufficiently strategic manner , knowing the sensitivity of this whole question .
once again I thank everyone for their support and I urge you to vote and support this package .
i therefore cannot allow you to speak now , the debate is closed .
i am sorry .
a sum of eur 3.5 billion has been allocated for this .
will this programme contribute to overcome the crisis ?
i doubt it .
in my opinion however , the projects should include energy connections between poland and germany .
this is particularly disturbing , when the food security of the european union is under threat .
the various solar energy projects , in particular , would have deserved to receive financing .
it may also help to gain additional income , especially in small , family holdings .
the second step is that we must now achieve stronger integration of financial market supervision .
the second area is securitisation , the granting of loans .
nonetheless , there is still a lot to do .
this needs financial resources .
this is a good signal .
it has been a pleasure to work with you all .
this is why the commission proposed to provide them with financial support .
we are not fully satisfied with this .
it is now recognised by the g20 as a key measure to strengthen the financial system .
adequate diversification and collateral are critical to ensuring financial stability .
much recovery is on track .
finally , you should have also decided to introduce guarantees for bank deposits .
we welcome this .
so the sooner that we can get europe's quality control securitisation working , the better .
a 10 % hit during times of ongoing capital stress would just hurt borrowers and businesses , not banks .
funding should also be sought from the user side such as investors .
on behalf of the ind / dem group . sv thank you , mr president .
we have now gone through a global financial meltdown and it is continuing to cause us problems .
we need then to analyse why this has happened before we begin to act at eu level .
we have banks that aretoo big to fail, as the catchphrase goes .
we ought to consider whether this might not be part of the solution .
we have deposit guarantees for small scale savers and even quite large scale savers .
i doubt that .
i wish to congratulate the rapporteurs and the groupsshadow rapporteurs for the compromise that has been reached .
i would like to thank mrs berès for her amendment to the proposal .
the progress achieved with the restructuring of the financial market framework is good but not yet sufficient .
the work will therefore continue .
i acknowledge that mr karas has achieved many things .
mr president , I am standing here with mixed feelings in my last debate in this house .
this is a step towards strong european supervision of the financial markets that have developed far beyond national borders .
i strongly recommend that the committee on economic and monetary affairs reinstate this process .
five per cent is not significant .
commissioner mccreevy brought up 15 % and was then beaten down to 5 % by the industry .
the council went along with this and the european parliament cut a very sorry figure indeed .
will various countries contribute to a joint fund ?
in the months to come , I look forward to continuing this work with you in the new parliament .
the basel committee will work on quantitative retention . this has been required by the glet me just make a point concerning securitisation .
mrs bowles made a pretty strong contribution in this regard .
people know my views on this .
in other words , the debate will continue , it has to continue .
i wish all those who will voluntarily not be returning all the best for the future .
this is my last speech , as I have already said .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place today , wednesday 6 may 200written statements rule 142 
the presidency was able to reject this immediately as incorrect .
it is an accusation of a serious criminal offence .
i demand the retraction of this accusation , an apology and a condemnation by the presidency .
applause 
i see that mr hans peter martin would like the floor .
i give it to you briefly .

i have the right to make a personal comment under rule 1i absolutely reject what my fellow member has just uttered .
i stand by it .
and if I am being accused ..
but that is what the right wing extremists are like .
the president cut off the speaker 
thank you , mr donnici .
are there any objections ?
i find this unacceptable .
cfp repeal of 14 obsolete regulations 
the petitions process amendment of title viii of the rules of procedure 
draft amending budget no 5 / 2009 
general revision of the rules of procedure 
our committee complied with the conclusions of the reform group point by point .
i think it would be more helpful for us if we were to proceed that way around .
voting time
for the results and other details on the vote see minutes . 
for many of you this will be your last week in strasbourg .
applause 
that is what I have striven for .
ladies and gentlemen , we have also placed tackling climate change at the top of the political agenda .
one often hears that others are taking the lead in tackling climate change .
it is now at the heart of a european parliamentary democracy unimaginable in 197together we have advanced parliamentary democracy in the european union and beyond .
the european parliament and national parliaments are now partners .
now parliament also participates in the institutional and constitutional deliberations of the summits .
this is a huge step forward .
the work was completed successfully .
together we have succeeded in adapting the working methods of the european parliament to changing political circumstances .
it is the supreme value .
applause 
you are worthy of our thanks , our support and our appreciation .
we have just had another meeting of the conference of presidents .
the legacy of a president of the european parliament is always subject to political scrutiny .
you have presented your conclusions .
there is nothing to add .
the question therefore remains what has the president , as a human being , done for this house ?
this house does not always conduct itself with dignity . but that is true of all parliaments worldwide .
loud applause 
that is a record to be proud of and a legacy on which your successors should build .
applause 
others have an international dimension , such as the conflict in the middle east , which you mentioned .
it is vital .
what kind of a parliament is this ?
if you believed in democracy , you would not just bulldoze aside those three referendum results .
our right to do so was set out unequivocally in the rules of procedure .
this is not the time to have that argument all over again .
my friends , I hope that there will be many more of us souverainistes here in july .
applause 
there will be many new members .
i should also like to congratulate you on 30 years as an elected member of the european parliament .
is it not necessary to hold these candidates to account ?
this is very important for both the harbour and the trautmann reports .
mrs dahl , as far as I am aware there is no problem .
that is why we have withdrawn the amendment .
throughout the negotiations on this compromise , I have worked faithfully and harmoniously with all of the political groups .
that is the consequence of the vote that is being taken today .
the revised directive will not enter into force before the end of the next legislative term .
european globalisation adjustment fund 
economic recovery programme energy projects 
protection of animals at the time of killing 
the agriculture committee has proposed to remove the obligation to create the reference centre at a national level .
i suggest voting on amendment 64 separately .
voting against amendment 85 will support the commission proposal to reduce the transport time .
renewed social agenda 
it is important that we try to get the maximum support for this report at the end .
we have all been here some time , as , particularly , have our interpreters .
we did consider that formula .
i voted against .
the community budget cannot be recycled using the flexibility mechanism .
the fund is also an opportunity to reduce the disproportion between old and new european union member states .
i do not understand why we have ever had this bizarre rule .
the longest serving member at least has experience to fall back on , rather than merely age .
within months he had stood down , having performed his function of bringing ridicule upon the european parliament .
we cannot , 20 years on , allow mr le pen a second opportunity to bring europe into disrepute .
the classics used to teach that to err is human to persist in error is diabolical .
the lesson has clearly not been learned .
when will the minority groups be eliminated ?
when will recalcitrant members be eliminated ?
it is , in fact , unreasonable to change a general rule to suit a specific case .
that is a shame .
i hope it will prevent the election of mr le pen and that this exercise will thus prove pointless .
they shall not have the right to vote or to stand for election to positions within parliament .
afterwards , each can then lay the blame on the other person .
one month from the european elections , that is a strong sign .
mr sarkozy and his friends in themajorshave some respite .
this type of behaviour can only be encouraged .
social insurance is a matter of national competence and for this reason I voted against amendment self employment remains a minority form of employment in europe , accounting for 16 % of the working population .
only one third of selfemployed workers are women .
however , it is worth pointing out that the stringent proposals made seek primarily to ensure minimum levels .
thus , the wordings do not prevent the member states from going further if they so wish .
selfemployed people currently make up only 16 % of the working population .
we are currently facing an unprecedented crisis .
the european globalisation adjustment fund egf was established in 2006 and will function until 20the purpose of the egf is to provide support for workers made redundant as a result of globalisation .
instead , an increase in assistance from eur 3.5 billion to nearly eur 4 billion is proposed !
we have voted against the report as a whole .
however , the content has become far too focussed on fossil fuels .
such projects would be cost effective and would reduce emissions and create new jobs .
however , this requires a significantly large retention .
this opens the floodgates to unfair competition against public banks in germany .
in writing . I congratulate mr karas .
mr karas can be satisfied with his work in the negotiations .
taxpayersmoney must be used wisely .
it is important , particularly during these turbulent times , for us to be careful with our common resources .
however , the present report leads us in a completely different direction .
supervision of the financial institutions within the eu is not a task for the eu at the present time .
it is important to bear this in mind .
i voted for the report on the protection of animals at the time of killing .
every year in the european union , millions of animals are killed .
however , we believe that social security schemes and the minimum wage should be determined at a national level .
therefore , conservatives have abstained on this report .
this report contains many contradictions .
the guiding principle is the same as always .
we therefore voted against the report in the final vote .
this is particularly important to enable us to deal with the problem of theworking poor.
however , conservatives do not support the concept of an eu discrimination directive .
these issues should be matters of national competence .
we have therefore tabled an alternative resolution which contains all the elements of her report which we do support .
we need to create more jobs and more capacity in our labour markets .
we now continue with the vote .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting see minutes
composition of parliament see minutes
in addition , the paragraph on remembering the holocaust was maintained in the text .
there is also a continuing need to enhance dialogue and mutual understanding and to promote tolerance .
the eu has a strong acquis on the fight against racism and xenophobia .
these examples demonstrate our collective commitment to work on this issue both internally and more widely with partners worldwide .
the durban review conference was part of those wider efforts .
as you are aware , five member states have decided against taking part in this conference .
the fight against racism and against the incitement of hate by president ahmadinejad and others deserved better .
why was europe divided ? why ?
that is the problem .
there was never any common ground , so there was never an eu position before the conference .
in any case , the european union has adopted a policy of actively fighting racism .
we are very well aware of the challenges we continue to face in this area .
this is not easy , but I would like to draw your attention to a number of successes .
more disappointingly , we failed to reintroduce the mandate of an independent expert on the drc .
this has led to positive results , in particular the follow up resolution on the death penalty .
on human rights defenders , the eu will continue to cooperate with civil society organisations .
in dialogues with third countries , freedom of expression and raising individual cases will remain central to our agenda .
this dialogue is valuable .
i am very grateful in general for the work of this parliament and its support on human rights issues .
allow me to give a few examples .
we are launching a pilot programme aimed at 10 countries on different continents .
in 2009 , we are continuing down this path with the following initiatives .
i personally place a great deal of importance on this forum .
compromises have been reached .
mentioning specific names in our resolution would be counterproductive .
the same holds true for children .
i think that sends out an important signal .
our policies are compartmentalised .
in europe , we agree that this is unacceptable , but we continue to operate double standards .
we have to put a stop to that .
things look very bad for respect for human rights in many countries worldwide .
i should also like to suggest once again that the subcommittee on human rights be made a standing committee .
it is often also the problem of values versus economic interest .
this would significantly ease relations between the eu and china .
we will therefore have to uphold our legitimate demands on china .
talks with the dalai lama , the religious leader of the tibetans , must be resumed .
madam president , my congratulations to the rapporteur and to other colleagues .
let me remind you of two examples .
today 1 600 eu citizens are still missing since the 1974 turkish invasion of cyprus .
thousands of civilians eu citizens living in these areas are subjected to .
applause 
this is a small moment of joy in our presidency .
on the death penalty , it is clear that we must make abolition the achievement of our generation .
i believe we have to double our efforts in reaching out to governments .
this is a personal commitment that is very dear to my heart .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
if you do not mind then .
thank you .
written statement rule 142 
in writing . hu mr president , ladies and gentlemen .
this is my last speech in this plenary session .
i am happy that what I am leaving now is a european union with 27 members .
it has been a unique , magnificent experience .
thank you very much , and goodbye for the last time .
this means that the issue of solidarity must be addressed in a broader context .
i must also thank the authors of the amendments .
this is the first time that parliament has given its verdict , as colegislator , on asylum issues .
i thank mr masip hidalgo once again for his excellent presentation .
we need to arrive at a fairer distribution of the beneficiaries of international protection among member states .
there are amendments with the aim of radically changing the procedure for appointing the director of the future office .
others , obviously , have invoked the principle of subsidiarity .
frankly , I do not share these criticisms .
thank you .
we cannot deny that any longer .
their publication is scheduled for 24 june .
the game being played in malta is actually not very clear , and I will explain myself straight away .
the italian government has asked malta on many occasions to reduce its huge expanse of territorial waters .
both proposals are moving in the direction of improving the european union reception system for asylum seekers .
i therefore believe that this is a benchmark for the civilisation of our political initiative and our law making capacity .
all asylum seekers should have fast access to the labour market .
i take the view that it is a matter for the member states to take this decision .
as this is not the case , approximately 95 % are simply not granted asylum .
the dublin regulation is the same in certain respects , as it promotes asylum shopping .
we want to see greater transparency and accountability , as I think the rapporteur is also striving to do .
with these safeguards , we will have a strong addition to a fair and balanced common european asylum system .
that must be a fundamental condition .
the debate on the return directive is closed we were all in agreement .
we have introduced , among other things , a mechanism to identify vulnerable persons .
obviously , the member states must ensure the fair , balanced implementation of the principles that we have suggested .
however , this regulation cannot serve as a legal basis creating an intra community transfer mechanism .
we hope that we can get this office up and running as soon as possible .
europe cannot turn its back on its commitments to countries that once were recklessly exploited .
hopefully the european asylum support office will help to ease the burden of the member states concerned .
the next item is the joint debate on
what , though , is the origin of the issue that we are concerned with today ?
personally , mr president , I am not a great legal expert .
that really is the main ingredient of mutual recognition .
it is thanks to these things that we will be able to implement the new eurojust decision quickly .
congratulations on your report , mrs pagano .
this is a fundamental issue that I wished to introduce into this debate .
i would like to tell you about an example of this close to us here in europe .
if defiance of strasbourg happens , then the fundamental rights safeguards in the european arrest warrant must be invoked .
lastly , I must honestly say that I have some doubts about mrs pagano's european parliament recommendation .
i do not wish to prolong the debate .
this is indeed a desirable development .
mr president , when we began this work we were aware that we were walking on thin ice .
there were strong opposing winds in your country .
today you have served the european cause well !
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday , at 12 noon .
the council appreciates all similar efforts by the european parliament to the same end .
es thank you very much for your answer , mr president .
subject climate change
you started your presidency with the reputation of being climate sceptics .
the poles and the germans also have a bit of tidying up to do .
again , thank you .
de mr president , I congratulate the czech presidency on the decision in the senate .
subject croatia , macedonia and southeast europe
forecasts of the conclusion of the negotiating process cannot be made .
maintaining good neighbourly relations , including a negotiated and mutually acceptable solution on the main issue , remains essential .
in december 2008 montenegro filed its membership application .
second , will you name a date for macedonia this year ?
third , what is the timeframe for relaxing visa restrictions ?
it has been one of the main goals of this presidency since the outset to unblock this situation .
many thanks .
lt I too would like to thank you for your comprehensive reply .
subject health care abroad
in the council's view , how can these opposing positions of parliament and the council be reconciled ?
what possible compromise proposals does the council envisage ?
however , it depends on the member statesnational policy .
yes , let us applaud the czech senate all the way from strasbourg to prague .
we are very pleased with this outcome .
that is not true of everyone , though .
applause 
the treaty thereby strengthens the community method and transforms it into the union method .
furthermore , that method will be extended to the former justice and home affairs pillar .
that the parliaments of 26 countries have ratified the treaty of lisbon shows that it is a parliamentary treaty .
that is why they tell the lies that they tell .
and it was no meagre majority it was 54 that is a gigantic lead for those who said yes to the treaty of lisbon .
there are many opportunities open to national parliaments through their right of veto .
this will be the last budgetary report of this parliamentary term and my last parliamentary report .
speaking about the treaty of lisbon in this house is not a denial of democracy , rather the contrary .
that is the whole thrust of this report simplification and clarification of the budgetary challenges of the treaty .
first of all , modifications to the primary legislation .
in addition , changes are made to the new multiannual financial framework that strengthen parliament's role .
this is real progress .
their inclusion in the convention's draft constitution was neither a sure fire thing nor the result of chance .
the time has come for direct democracy in a united europe .
today's vote brings to 26 the number of member states whose parliaments have backed the treaty .
the reports are particularly valuable in deepening our thinking on how the treaty should work in practice .
still , this is not enough .
however , these methods can only be agreed once the vice president and high representative has taken office .
citizens will be able to call on the commission to bring forward new policy initiatives .
if so requested , this practice must also apply to the special representatives .
we affirm that this service should be assigned to the commission for administrative purposes .
so national parliaments are greatly affected by the changes afoot .
i think it is good that we will have the treaty of lisbon .
that is why the controversial treaty of lisbon may be perceived positively from the perspective of local authorities .
under the treaty , more effective consultations with local and regional authorities and their associations are required .
you all know that the czech republic's view is critical yet realistic .
this mentality is clearly one of the reasons why we are debating tonight .
it is one of the most sensitive areas in the constitution .
applause 
a day will come when federal and cosmopolitan parliaments will join to govern the world .
the sublime dignity of man is now the principle that brings together national and international law .
you have already thanked a few who are unfortunately no longer with us .
first , I thank johannes voggenhuber , a veritable cornerstone of our work for democracy and civil rights .
carlos carnero gonzález was always with us .
and , last but not least although she is not a member of the committee catherine guy quint .
the commission should exercise its right of initiative and draft a bill very soon after the reorganisation .
thank you , mr dehaene .
it is the best treaty that can be agreed at this time .
that was not the agreement .
i am giving my last speech after 15 years .
it has been a great honour .
allow me to , perhaps , take a look into the future .
without a major crisis you will never manage to create a real european democracy , a real political community .
we really do need a major crisis.
but we have it .
yes , we did not dismount from the barricades , the governments simply said njet .
and the citizensinitiatives ?
why ?
there are a number of regulations in this area .
there ispermanent structured cooperationenabling a military core europe .
only one would never call it that today .
conditions have changed fundamentally .
ireland has decided .
sv I will now switch to my own language .
it should be complicated .
this is what the american constitution is like .
so much for democracy !
we are no better on the rule of law .
britain will voteno.
let me give colleagues due notice .
we will deliver a referendum and we will kill this wretched and shameful treaty stone dead .
that is precisely what today's reports are doing .
as its legislative functions are limited , this responsibility essentially falls under article 265 on the failure to act .
for them , the union is distant and unknown , even though they feel that they need it .
we have not had the time to finish our work nor to conclude our debate on this issue .
once again , my warmest thanks to the czech senate , the czech parliament and the czech government .
such accusations are an affront to the principles of friendly international relations , as well as simple human decency .
but we have plenty of time to come back to that , should the treaty indeed come into force .
we are talking on the day where we have achieved the 26th parliamentary ratification .
that is a very high hurdle to reach .
those eurosceptics over there only need one victory out of that is the way it is .
i notice they only quote the referendums that have given anoresult .
they never manage to mention the spanish referendum , the luxembourg referendum .
the two of us have been budget coordinators for our respective political groups .
i have learnt a great deal !
this is described well and clearly in mrs guy quint's report .
this would enable us always to help shape these frameworks .
parliament would have full influence over the entire budget , including the agriculture budget .
having only one reading followed by negotiations to reach agreement forces us to prepare earlier and much more carefully .
that is not such a silly idea in essence .
we simply want to ensure that relations between the institutions and the citizens are improved .
we are getting new powers in environmental protection and climate change .
as if a single nation state could solve these problems on its own !
for air and water in particular , and in various other areas too , that is just not possible .
in view of the crisis , it is particularly important that the european union be given these powers .
new legal bases are also important , however .
it makes one wonder who could have developed such a complicated system .
it has also demonstrated the strength of our commitment to take europe forward .
we are now entering a very decisive phase .
i believe that we should also be instrumental in ensuring that this is possible .
it would be foolish of us not to do so .
this union of ours is unique .
no doubt future parliaments and indeed future councils will identify and agree further reforms .
but europe also needs a new direction .
will the five year budgetary term coincide with or be accentuated by the five year parliamentary term ?
the treaty of lisbon is the stronger engine which we need to face the crisis .
could I thank , first of all , all the rapporteurs of the five reports .
i understand it has been referred to a judicial review .
you have a choice .
perhaps the steps that are being taken are not big enough .
i thank the rapporteurs for their courage and their ability to create the necessary documents .
i welcome today's decision of the czech senate approving the treaty of lisbon .
not all .
in the end they did what he said .
of those who did vote , half voted against the treaty because they had not read it .
this will probably be the lowest in the entire european union .
i am a member of the law and justice party , the largest opposition party .
the statement that there is no one here from that party is untrue .
so let us not push ahead with the lisbon treaty until every country has ratified it .
if you really want a proper democratic debate , let the people of britain have a choice .
it is really about tackling these problems , which today are not national .
these reports give us a good grounding and a good platform to reform the way we work .
applause 
thank you once again .
it was a major debate , an important debate .
three hundred and fifty representatives of the people in 26 countries have saidno.
they cannot all be fools and scatterbrains .
it is the most social european treaty there has ever been .
thank you very much .
i would still argue that we ought to broker an agreement between parliament and the council before the elections .
all of that requires conviction , time and , above all , political courage , which we are lacking .
parliament's importance in the eu's decisionmaking process has grown with each european treaty .
the treaty will bring the eu closer to its citizens .
i would like to make a few comments about the procedure for appointing the european commission .
this will help us make their accession to the eu a simpler , smoother process .
lv mr president , it was not really clear on which report I could speak now .
it is just that I did not react immediately .
the difference enables us to interpret matters .
but when we protested in favour of a referendum , 14 of us were fined .
dictatorship and manipulation?
why on earth did it get such a huge majority if it was such a negative report ?
hopefully we can correct that in the next parliament .
after all , members have a right to have their say .
but , thanks to an ecj judgment , some innocent people's data will now be returned .
the current system of domain names and registrations works brilliantly .
i think not .
twenty two years ago a corresponding directive was passed .
let me try and address this in contemporary terms , helped by a lady called kristen mccauliff .
opening on a stressed marge , it shows a sped up version of her daily routine .
local newsman kent brockman shows up to report on the situation .
therefore , there are many people who are self employed many of them women , who are often overlooked .
there is noreturn to senderfor them .
member states should ensure that assisting spouses can become members of sickness and invalidity insurance schemes and pension schemes .
fortunately my mistake did not change the final result of voting .
some meps and some political parties reject the idea of large scale investment at this time .
i stand up next to a mountain and I chop it down with the edge of my hand . 
i think we can all learn from that .
they display a professionalism from which a lot of members of this parliament could learn .
secondly , I would ask the presidency to look again at the rules .
it really alarms me that we have arbitrarily set aside what our rules of procedure plainly state .
if we want to change that rule , then that is fine .
is that our community of values ?
we can work it out together .
et sometimes it is good to be first , and sometimes it is good to be last .
we have spoken extensively about flexibility in labour market policy .

media mundus audiovisual cooperation programme with professionals from third countries debate 
the media mundus programme we are discussing today is a fantastic response .
that is always a win win situation for people from third countries within europe .
so it will create new business opportunities for professionals from europe and around the globe .
all in all , this is a project that helps all sides .
it was high time this happened .
mr president , commissioner , mrs hieronymi , I should like to extend my sincere congratulations on this report .
this needs the financial support we are giving .
i should especially like to thank mrs hieronymi and wish her all the best .
she has been an excellent colleague and media expert .
this is , of course , a good concept .
therefore it is no surprise that it is losing .
europe's small share in the worldwide circulation of audiovisual works is a significant example of this .
however , we do not have to rend our garments .
initiatives like the programme we are discussing are a small but necessary step .
i congratulate mrs hieronymi on her report .
that is why I am pleased that we have succeeded in getting this programme off the ground .
because that is what moves people in their hearts and minds .
some of you know that you will be coming back .
it has been enjoyable and pleasant working for you .
thank you for your cooperation .
the worldwide development of the european film industry is made possible thanks to this new media mundus programme .
in fact , this programme is rooted in a policy .
i congratulate the rapporteur and wish her every success in her life after the european parliament .
a few years ago our film industry was in the doldrums .
it was cooperation with third countries which helped get it back on its feet again .
for the rest , I believe that film is the best vehicle for cultural diversity .
we should therefore support this sector , which is still in its infancy .
pl mr president , films from third countries are fairly often distributed in poland .
so here we can see very concrete action .
the debate is closed .
there are two aims to our stimulus and our input .
the landfill must be re covered by a final layer in order to prevent the dispersion of fibres .
measures must be taken to prevent any possible use of the land after the closure of the landfill .
waste containing asbestos is hazardous waste .
the current economic crisis cannot justify this extension .
the purpose of the resolution before us is not to quash the comitology decision to which it refers .
asbestos should have been banned operationally by the member states applying the 1999 directive .
whyyesin some states andnoin others ?
the european parliament is doing its bit to compensate for the failings of others .
thank you for those words .
asbestos is very often safe while it is covered .
applause 
thank you very much , mr bowis .
author . it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , my sentiments exactly .
i , too , would like to make a personal comment .
furthermore , let me remind you , the commission will conduct a general review in 20the debate is closed .
i recognise the perilous state that the aviation industry and airlines in particular face .
they may even be above board , but these deals done outside of the committee .
they have to cut flight costs .
lowering the 80 % threshold to 75 % would not solve our problems .
thank you , mr blokland .
it is right that we react quickly in such critical situations and try to find sensible solutions .
on the first day of school you normally get a school bag .
this regulation has been of benefit to no one and has protected no one .
thank you , mr rack .
that is why I support the suspension of this 80 / 20 rule .
thank you , mr fernandes .
parliament has called on the european commission to produce a coherent master plan for increasing airport capacity .
traffic at european airports does not only come from europe .
it is , however , the crisis that prompts this urgent intervention .
this is therefore a difficult situation .
as regards the regulations on supervision , we must strengthen the monitoring and application of regulation 26on the basis of this evaluation we will draw conclusions as to the future .
it is this gentleman who has the formidable task of carrying out this semantic classification .
quite simply because paul dunstan speaks 27 languages .
i believe that we can all be very proud of the quality and dedication of our staff .
laughter 
that is as nothing compared to the comments I have had from members of his party in e mails .
i would inform you that it was indeed a point of order , under rule 145 on personal statements .
mr titley's request to take the floor before our house was fully justified .
furthermore , women are still seriously underrepresented in high level posts in the commission and the council .
in fact , there is not a single female eu special representative at the moment .
for this reason , the report stresses that the eu needs to fully implement its commitments in this field .

please , please .
before the vote on paragraph 25
to that extent it was already topical in 2008 and what was said is particularly unfortunate .
i will read amendment 2 aloud .
the oral amendment was not accepted 
after the vote on amendment 16
yes , please excuse me , it was a slip of the tongue .
indeed , the majority was against .
it was worth having it checked , but the services had already rectified my mistake .
before the vote
mr president , first of all , I would like to make a technical remark .
it was in that sense that I agreed to this amendment .
relations between the european parliament and national parliaments under the treaty of lisbon 
after the vote
that is a real shame !
i hope that group rights will follow as quickly as possible .
i am grateful to this house for the understanding for minorities that has been forthcoming .
lt I voted in favour of mr leinen's report and resolution for the following reasons .
i do not know whether that is going to work .
if they now give in to the european parliament , I think they would be diminished as a people .
they do not turn up to this house .
that is an absolute disgrace .
there is no easy response to this issue either .
equally , we have to address the poverty around the world which contributes to migratory pressures .
mr president , I rise in support of the costa report .
it is not unusual for airlines to hoard airport slots .
let me share an example with you birmingham airport in my constituency .
ro the situation in the republic of moldova is now clear .
i would like to clearly say to the council that we must not be under any illusion .
in fact , history shows us that these actions must be vigorous .
the prüm treaty was forced into european law without proper democratic scrutiny .
this will fill few people with confidence .
it much prefers to tell them how we feel what they should want .
what people do care about here is time .
the answer is very simple to deny the british people a say on this matter .
fortunately , I am led to believe that that vote in the uk will come quite quickly .
so rush through what you like here .
the people of britain will get their say .
the sovereignty of a parliament is shorthand for the sovereignty of the people .
i voted for the report on gender mainstreaming in eu external relations .
therefore , british conservatives abstained on this report .
the report gathers opinions from different committees concerning the changes that the treaty of lisbon will entail .
i voted for mr leinen's report .
it also forms part of the anti democratic process and campaign aiming to impose this unacceptable draft treaty .
such is our hypocritical and cynical european democracy .
the majority in this parliament refuses to acknowledge its political losses .
the electorate in the member states still feels little involvement with the super centralist european parliament .
i do not believe that the european parliament should have greater influence on the eu budget .
i have voted against the report .
we social democrats welcome any initiative that improves the situation of asylum seekers and people with no documents .
this regulation establishes a procedure for the negotiation and conclusion of bilateral agreements between member states and third countries .
this proposal allows the commission to authorise the conclusion of such agreements .
however , I , personally , will be voting in favour of it .
there are many moldovans who have applied for romanian nationality .
we should help moldova on this road .
i wish to draw attention to two parts of the world firstly , central asia .
i voted for the annual report on human rights in the world 200this report essentially has two objectives .
i do not understand the authors of that amendment .
there are , unfortunately , a great many cases of the violation of human rights in the world .
the catholic church and many other confessions are our allies in the fight to ensure respect for human dignity .
attacking the pope is only evidence of pre election cynicism and harmful radicalism .
an independent foreign policy is essential for maintaining national sovereignty .
the present report contains a number of important statements supporting specific aspects of human rights .
however , the report as a whole is a means of promoting the eu's positions on foreign policy .
moreover , I am opposed to the aim of having joint structures and personnel for creating actual eu embassies .
i believe that the eu does not have competence in this area nor should it have .
there is little evidence that promoting the use of condoms actually prevents the transmission of aids .
let us reject this amendment .
therefore , we cannot support this proposal .
in writing . criminal justice is rightly the responsibility of eu member states .
people in my region do not want to see that occurring .
what about the inextricable differences between the legislations deriving from common law and those from written law ?
we fully respect each member state's right to decide for itself whether to ratify the treaty of lisbon .
the majority in this parliament refuses to acknowledge its political losses .
i voted for mr brok's report .
this report shows how important this new treaty of the european union is .
it would be a laughing matter if it were not so serious .
mr brok's report praises the convention that produced a draft constitutional treaty .
i voted for the report on the implementation of the citizensinitiative .
and , in any case , there is absolutely no obligation for the commission to listen to them .
it is also one of the many initiatives aiming to impose the unacceptable draft treaty of lisbon .
the majority in this parliament refuses to acknowledge its political losses .
mrs kaufmann's report counts its chickens before they are hatched .
in this situation there is no point in discussing this report in the european parliament .
the latter can choose to disregard these initiatives entirely if it suits them .
i have voted against the report .

iran the case of roxana saberi
the next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on iran the case of roxana saberi .
the fact is that ms saberi has had no access to her lawyer for more than a month .
there was no chance of a fair or transparent trial , because the trial was held in camera .
she was on hunger strike for at least two weeks .
that , too , is part of our message .
two and a half minutes , madam president .
some of our countries in the west are not free from blame for this situation .
we appeal for her to be given a fair trial .
we know that for five weeks she was denied access to a lawyer .
this time we are concerned about the unlawful imprisonment of roxana saberi .
the iranian government organised a one day closed door trial without witnesses or concrete , publicly declared charges .
we must recognise that iranian fundamentalists continue to organise political trials in an attempt to further intimidate free thinkers .
the medieval torture and execution of women even pregnant women and children is commonplace .
shame on them and shame on the brutal mullahs .
it was exactly that kind of approach in the past which led to the birth of the current regime .
madam president , I wish to support my colleague even though he is scottish struan stevenson .
there are many iranians who are decent and good people .
we can merely shout in rage against this form of brutality , this form of inhumanity .
also in this case the eu issued a statement strongly condemning the execution .
the bias and manipulation of the trial and the accused were a travesty of any sense of justice .
madagascar is a country with which we work closely and intensively .
applause 
that made his position untenable .
a minority government of a totally different political persuasion then took power , but nobody considered that a coup .
such an outcome is also possible in madagascar , provided that an election is held within the foreseeable future .
but , of course , by 1996 he had been impeached for corruption and the abuse of power .
this unconstitutional change of government is a serious setback for democratisation .
madam president , the political crisis in madagascar has led to an unconstitutional change of government .
president ravalomanana lost support , and he stood down on 17 march 200power was seized by rajoelina , who was designated by the army .
the african union has suspended madagascar from membership , and is critical of the removal of ravalomanana by force .
we call for restoration of constitutional order in madagascar .
the malagasy supreme court stated that the former mayor of antananarivo holds this office in accordance with the constitution .
many other colonies of european countries have suffered or are still suffering for the same reason .
my own country , cyprus , is one .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
venezuela the case of manuel rosales
i hope the eu will not let them down .
arresting the opposition is an even stronger signal .
venezuela is obliged to respect conventions which it has signed in which it guaranteed to respect human rights .
madam president , 20 years ago socialism collapsed at the pan european picnic on the austro hungarian border .
i have met manuel rosales .
long live a free venezuela !
at first , hugo chávez did not talk about socialism but only about the right to a better world .
his opponents were not invited to cooperate and they became his mortal enemies and later on political prisoners .
the case of manuel rosales only confirms what I am saying .
other leaders playing the same game as hugo chávez include castro's heirs , lukashenko and the like .
this is especially visible in third countries .
we can adopt suitable resolutions and even give them public effect .
we are europeans .
the commission is aware of the case of manuel rosales .
i wish to assure parliament that the commission will continue to follow developments in venezuela closely .
debates on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law

we have a climate crisis that has already resulted in climate refugees .
we see an eu and a world full of injustice and poverty .
on the contrary , in many areas it has helped to create the crises .
we need a policy that safeguards the participation of all citizens .
i want to see an eu that takes responsibility for ensuring fair and responsible international trade .
i want to see a diverse europe .
this is our opportunity .
applause 
the fight for human and civil rights has always been at the heart of my activity .
since 2004 , I have been a member of the european parliament .
it so happens that all of these matters are also our priorities during this current term of office .
we need to do everything we can to change this .

mario , I know how important for you human rights are .
applause

applause 
mr president , on behalf of our group I would like to congratulate you on your election .
it is the wish of our group that your presidency will be based on these values .
you should be aware of that .
applause 
the only request we have is to use it , this large pro european majority .
i was very pleased to hear you say that we need to get closer to our citizens .
the situation there also needs to improve .
we welcome you .
i come from eastern germany and work near słubice .
two of my sons speak polish .
andrzej wajda and other polish directors are part of our european culture .
mr president , you have our respect and our support !
i think the signs for change here are not very good .
the future of european democracy rests very heavily on irish shoulders .
mr president , you fought against the soviet union .
listen to the people , please .
thank you for your speech , mr farage .
european parliamentarianism has always provided a forum for various opinions .

i will be in touch with you about this .
the european council report and the commission statement on the outcome of the european council 18 19 june 2009 
please allow me to say a few words at the outset .
yesterday we inaugurated the seventh term of the european parliament .
the czech presidency has come to an end and a new european parliament is just starting out .
on the contrary , I see it rather as a confirmation of continuity in european politics .
we selected the motto ofeurope without barriersto represent this effort symbolically .
the czech republic itself successfully completed the ratification of the treaty of lisbon by both chambers of parliament .
during the czech presidency major progress was achieved in restoring confidence .
the continuity necessary to the work of the entire eu is again apparent here .
there was ample confirmation of this during the course of the czech presidency .
i would also mention the review of the globalisation adjustment fund .
over the last six months we have made much progress , for example by developing the baltic interconnection plan .
the european project has always been a long term one .
this is the reason why I am going to be working here in the european parliament .
i think that the czech republic managed very well in resolving the gas crisis of january this year .
the june summit is proof of this , since the entire agenda of the summit was successfully implemented .
prime minister , your predecessor did not have an easy or positive start .
that was and still is a real danger .
many people want to use the crisis to promote a new economic nationalism .
the whole of europe looked to prague in amazement .
with this move , the czech political class did a disservice both to its own country and to europe .
i do not think that this is something we ought to be proud of .
what are the reasons for this ?
applause 
i would also like to stress the importance of the eastern partnership initiative and its implementation .
of course you have been supported by mr barroso on that .
it is all about him and the eu institutions getting more power at the expense of the member states .
i am of course referring to the visit of václav klaus .
so at least for václav klaus we thank you very much for the last six months .
president of the commission . madam president , I should just like to put a question .
i am not criticising , but is it allowed to have flags in the chamber ?
mr farage held up a union flag . 
even the treaty of lisbon was only half heartedly criticised and delayed by the prague leadership .
croatia does not deserve that .
overall , our conclusions about the success of the czech presidency are somewhat mixed .
criticisms have been levelled here at the pace of financial market regulation .
i hope it will be final , decisive and correct .
personally I considered it a great challenge for my cabinet and for myself as well .
the teams showed that these interests are not mutually exclusive , even in times of crisis .
in addition , they convinced the french president , among others , that protectionism is a dirty word .
however , the czech presidency was particularly wrong on the directive on maternity leave .
i know what I am talking about , because I was the rapporteur for this report .
men have just as much right to see their children develop as women have to enjoy career success .
the exact same treaty of lisbon that 53 % of the voters rejected .
the truth is that we are paying the price for indecision .
the czech presidency had two faces and symbolically it had two premiers .
ga be prepared for a vigorous campaign against the treaty of lisbon in ireland .
i ask myself in all seriousness have we really become so modest in our expectations ?
he did of course promote the importance of national sovereignty here in parliament .
i should like to defend your honour against one of my irish colleagues , joe higgins .
the treaty of lisbon contains a horizontal social clause .
i would like to thank you for your contributions to the discussion .
once again , I wish you every success in your work .
i discussed this issue with the canadian prime minister in the margins of the last g8 meeting .
written statements rule 149 
in the eu , this crisis is the result of neoliberal policies which are still being pursued .
free and unregulated movement of capital and the existence of offshore financial centres 
there are great expectations of you .
i am addressing you during a challenging period .
rarely has the eu cooperation faced harsher tests and tests so varied in nature .
one thing is clear .
he was driven by a firm conviction that sweden belonged in europe .
it enabled me to see how european cooperation worked in practice .
this has in turn had an effect on the swedish population .
that is a victory for all of us who believe in european cooperation .
applause 
there would also be other serious consequences , however .
our climate is under threat from both our use of and our dependence on fossil fuels .
although time is short , it is still on our side .
we will improve public finances while at the same time households will have greater resources .
our investments in the green economy will create new job opportunities and drive growth in the decades ahead .
applause 
twelve years ago a coalition of the willing was formed in kyoto .
neither is it sufficient to have solutions that are based only on restrictions in the most developed countries .
that is why we must discuss the financing of investments in the developing countries .
in addition , we will need clear commitments in the medium term for countries outside europe too .
i know that the european parliament will accept its responsibility .
we agreed on a common recovery plan to stimulate the economy .
so what can we do ?
we must quickly get effective supervision in place to prevent similar crises occurring in the future .
the swedish presidency will work towards agreement on this in the council by the end of the year .
we are hoping for your help in achieving this quickly and conclusively .
our citizens will not accept the repeated use of tax revenues to rescue financial institutions that have acted irresponsibly .
mass unemployment , social unrest and growing tax pressure then await us .
we must also concentrate on reforms , modernisation and adaptation to a new reality .
that is something we should acknowledge and accept .
in the wake of the economic crisis we can see ideas of increased protectionism .
international criminality is growing ever stronger .
this is a threat to our democratic values and a threat to our citizens .
a flexible system for labour immigration could bring together these two realities .
we will act as anhonest broker.
these days the world's problems come knocking on the eu's door .
let us together meet their expectations .
i want to see a europe that takes responsibility for the economy .
lending for spendingcannot be the only motto .
such a europe will be strong whatever the times .
let us do so with vision and drive , with initiative and courage .
this dream makes europe strong .
loud applause 
the european union's collective action has led to an unprecedented fiscal effort that is producing concrete results .
we need to put into practice the shared commitment to youth and to employment .
you will have heard about the progress made at these meetings .
we also need to make progress on the necessary means to support developing countries and boost technology transfer .
it is important to discuss procedure , but I believe it is even more important to discuss substance .
during these last 50 years europe has consistently exceeded expectations , confounding doubts .
job security is vital for the internal stability of society .
as you have just said , you travel a lot in sweden and in europe .
we therefore need initiatives from the european union .
wonderful !
in that case , I would like to know which country will have no commissioner .
then we can vote on everything else on the basis of the treaty of lisbon .
great ! 
you will see that in a few seconds my six minutes will be up .
this must be your absolute priority .
how far have we come ?
mr barroso , what happened to your forceful intervention ?
we have seen no evidence of them .
applause 
since we have respect for democracy , we should respect the vote of the irish people .
transparency is needed in particular when combating the crisis we are currently experiencing .
those who bask in innocence do nothing to combat the crisis .
we must also perhaps avoid making comparisons your country borders norway I live near switzerland .
mr president , this parliament spends its time regulating matters that should be determined in the member states themselves .
we also want to see the negotiations with turkey brought to an immediate end .
turkey is an islamic country and the islamic ideology is completely at odds with our western culture .
i know that a number of you were elected with very strong support .
it is important to be able to represent your respective groups strongly .
this was done by eu minister cecilia malmström .
let me say that we are putting jobs first .
we are having this discussion in sweden , and it is also taking place around europe .
the average spent in europe on such commitments is 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product .
sweden is fairly unique in that one per cent of our gross domestic product goes to development aid .
mr president , some important questions have been asked I shall try to answer them very briefly .
the treaty in force is the treaty of nice .
with your support I believe we can achieve success at the copenhagen conference .
i would like to take this perspective one step further .
trade union rights must take precedence over free movement .
it must do more to help those who are affected by the crisis .
this falls under your remit , and it is very important for the credibility of our institutions .
how are you going to deal with the ippc directive on industrial emissions ?
how are you going to deal with illegal felling ?
the same applies to my hometown and the stockholm programme .
then we will have made progress .
mr president , I would like to congratulate the swedish presidency for prioritising economic challenges .
they need workable and defined legislative timetables , prioritisation of legislation and proper consultation .
prime minister and fellow members , thank you for your account of the presidency's programme .
the crises have their origin in political decisions made .
neither have we heard anything about the famous progressive equality policy .
fi mr president , ladies and gentlemen , sweden has always respected human rights and democracy .
i am very pleased that you mentioned the baltic sea , and I fully support you in this matter .
the baltic sea is in difficulties it is dying and it needs to be saved .
after all , it is exciting ideas that lie behind at the birth of social change .
it is therefore so very important to continue to build towards a sustainable economy and towards preventing climate change .
it is good that you give such a high priority to this in your programme .
you mentioned that this enlargement process will be slower than many people on both sides would have wished .
however , the appropriate preparations must naturally be made by these countries .
the level of unemployment that we are seeing today in europe has not yet reached its maximum .
you have a lot on your plate .
the energy policy , just as some have said , requires both realism and solidarity .
no new gas crises , no unilateral dependence .
here sweden has a great responsibility to bring what is known as the telecoms package to a successful conclusion .
the rule of law must also apply in the virtual world .
now this will not be the case , and I am sorry for that .
now is the time for political leadership and drive .
the euro has proved its strength .
thank you , and as we say in my party good luck !
the most important thing is that we achieve the emission reduction targets for 20i would like , however , to draw attention to three challenges .
the first of these is european solidarity , which is especially important at a time of financial crisis .
we cannot allow situations to arise in which particular european countries are treated unequally .
secondly , we are glad that the baltic sea strategy is one of the priorities of the swedish presidency .
i am sure that the swedish presidency will be equal to these challenges .
i am , of course , referring to the second referendum .
thank you very much and good luck in a difficult time of upheaval .
today the ministers are meeting in stockholm to discuss the stockholm programme .
furthermore , I believe that our work in strasbourg must be discontinued .
the next six months are crucial for europe's citizens and for the european union .
many proposals and new programmes are being put forward .
we need a breakthrough in the climate change summit in december .
i am confident the irish people will tell this particular circus what they told libertas get lost !
it therefore requires a differentiated approach .
speech interrupted 
this is not an easy time for europe it is full of challenges .
thank you for your attention .
third , for estonia the stockholm programme is important .
i believe that the baltic sea strategy could increase the legitimacy of the entire eu .
the baltic sea strategy can also help to check the crime trend and trafficking .
president barack obama gave an extraordinary speech about africa in africa the other day .
let them not distract you from your mission , your purpose .
i believe that we must concentrate on the essentials .
the first of these priorities is the unequivocal opposition to discrimination , racism , anti semitism , xenophobia and homophobia .
it is regrettable that the swedish presidency is resigning itself to the informal and disputed framework of the gthose in favour of the treaty cannot afford to be complacent in any way .
the president cut off the speaker 
i would also like to thank him for sweden's engagement in development of the eastern partnership .
allow me to thank you for having represented your respective party groups very well .
a number of the ministers in my cabinet are here with me today .
it is very important for the european parliament .
to force through those outdated policies now would be disastrous , for it would make the crisis worse .
quite the contrary .
people are losing their jobs , many businesses are going bankrupt , while national budgets are in major deficit .
the eu's swedish presidency has a huge responsibility towards its citizens .
the swedish presidency is seeking to speed up capitalist restructurings , within the framework of the lisbon strategy .
de mr president , I think you need to explain something .
we are at present conducting a test .
i just wanted to reiterate this as it has confused many members .
the composition of the new bureau shall be notified to the presidents of the institutions of the european communities .
the next item is the vote .
the issue on our agenda at this time is iran .
in spite of the current delicate situation in iran , the commission believes strongly in maintaining a dialogue .
we should strive for engagement with iran at all levels .
our present differences with the government of iran are many some are very serious .
everyone knows the facts all too well , so I will not dwell on that .
dialogue , even if a very difficult dialogue .
the crucial nuclear question is on hold , and we ask the question what is the way forward ?
that does not represent british people's views that is not europe's attitude towards islam .
what is more , iran is located in one of the most sensitive areas on the planet .
such is the case for the iranian people .
why are we not prepared to put tougher sanctions in place ?
not even the most recent developments in iran justify plans for military action against iranian nuclear installations .
the government of a sovereign state must openly accept the desire for change and drive through a political solution .
secondly , because of the strong influence that religious extremism exerts on the political power of the islamic republic .
the european union needs to maintain a united front and continue to condemn the abuses committed in iran .
we need to fully involve russia and china , which are permanent members of the security council .
the iranian people want freedom and we must support the call for free elections under un supervision .
we must demonstrate that we do not cooperate with dictatorships .
mr president , last year I served as a monitor at commemorations for the 1956 revolution in budapest .
the fairness of the election should be verified by independent external observers otherwise the election will be pointless .
i sincerely hope that mrs rajavi is right .
what a difference !
mr president , a crucial change has taken place in iran .
our first conclusions , therefore , should be that iran is not and will not be the same again .
i would also like to express concern at iran's nuclear programme .
we must be clear that our subject today is the situation of democracy and human rights in iran .
talk about new sanctions will not under any circumstances help to resolve the serious problems of the iranian people .
unfortunately , our group chairmen have rejected a motion for a resolution .
what is currently being discussed in the council and also in the member states ?
anything else will be a waste of time and will prolong this disgrace .
first of all , the iranian regime is unpredictable .
so we should hardly be surprised by the mere stealing of an election through wholesale electoral fraud .
this is , as has been pointed out , a most important debate on a most important subject .
i think we must then operate along two lines .
so we must condemn the killings , the use of the death sentence .
i come from a country where 1 % of our citizens have a background in iran .
they move back and forth .
we have consular issues that are of a multitude that is difficult to fathom .
we have the nuclear dossier that has been alluded to .
there might be others who believe there are far more simple solutions to that .
i am grateful for this debate .
we know what we want to achieve we must also seek to achieve it .
but do not think it is going to be easy .
the debate is closed .
china debate 
it also brings challenges of different sorts .
we have the annual summit meetings and we have fairly frequent meetings at the level of foreign ministers .
we also have the annual high level dialogue on trade and economic issues .
yet china is a huge country with considerable internal challenges and differences between its regions .
we have called on all parties to show restraint and bring an immediate end to all acts of violence .
we hope the situation can be resolved peacefully through dialogue without further bloodshed .
they pose no direct terrorist threat .
therefore , delaying a solution with regard to identity delays a solution in the long term .
china's problems stem in this instance from the greying of the middle kingdom .
i saw this when I visited urumqi four years ago .
indeed , the biggest problems in europe are found in the younger democracies , like spain and hungary .
i am convinced that the european union can play an important role in working with china to these ends .
however , this is not a conflict where the two sides are equal .
in xinjiang , the region of the uighurs , there is just as little cultural autonomy as in tibet .
this can be seen from a blatant campaign by government agencies against peaceful protestant house churches of late .
thus , on 3 july , eight christians were arrested in xinjiang during a service .
in xinjiang , the internet was blocked completely , limiting communications into and out of the desert region .
the clashes between uighurs and hans have taken the official death toll to 186 , but the bloodshed continues .
of course violence by the uighurs should be condemned too .
i do not think so .
the uighurs are currently being accused of separatism .
however , is it separatism if a house is on fire and I try to escape from this house ?
however , is a people in the wrong simply because it is smaller in number ?
i do not think so .
we , as the european union , therefore have an important obligation .
we respect the chinese system .
however , that does not mean .
that is what we social democrats are calling for .
we must condemn it .
that is the road to chaos and conflict .
hu the question is where do we stand on this issue ?
are we on the side of china or tiananmen square ?
are we on the side of 1.2 billion chinese or 8 million uighurs ?
where do we stand then ?
it is obvious to me whose side I am on .
i hope that it is clear to my fellow members too .
we still have a huge amount of work to do .
we are seeing all of these seriously repressed .
when we talk about xinjiang the worduighursshould also be mentioned .
i would like to say one last thing to mr posselt .
he spoke of separatism .
so the vast majority of those killed were han chinese .
so let us base our criticism on facts and not take unfair records against the chinese .
we ought therefore to be very discriminating in our observation of this situation and investigate the causes and effects .
we should be careful not to take a one sided position .
however , it is also showing the will to improve in many areas .
ethnic violence is always evil .
they are not there yet .
few societies as a matter of fact are , but it has been fairly obvious .

it is well known that the afghan army and police force are in a difficult financial situation .
the commission has been attentive .
the eu treaty leaves no room for economic nationalism .
this situation has been exacerbated by the crisis .
there are no figures in sight showing a recovery .
the primary responsibility for managing the crisis obviously lies with the automotive industry itself .
with around eur 40 million , we are helping around 7 000 workers back into the labour market .
this strategy means that it is necessary to take a leap forward in terms of automotive technology .
the european car industry , as we are all aware , suffers from considerable overcapacity .
and those principles will be my guidance in my assessment in the opel case .
i would ask the commission , however , to proceed with the necessary speed .
in 2007 , 58 million cars were sold worldwide , while capacities were 72 million .
opel has had problems .
if you agree we can give the floor to mr méndez de vigo , otherwise you may continue .
i can fully identify with the outlook that commissioner špidla set out for the european car industry .
in this field , the rules on competition are stricter than those on state aid .
in any case , this should emerge clearly from the investigation .
brussels cannot just criticise germany or other governments .
financial protectionism on its own would simply extend the life of uncompetitive activities .
i say this entirely without irony .
it is not yet too late .
it relates to jobs all across europe , and special treatment here for germany would not be right .
i am therefore particularly pleased to see that the commission is willing to examine this case .
we do want to save every job , but at what price ?
it could mark the most expensive election campaign in the history of germany .
i should like to discuss a number of things that have been said in this debate .
he said that a number of methods have been used to set this to rights .
he mentioned the globalisation fund , to which there have been seven applications .
i have complete confidence in commissioner kroes , who is going to examine every aspect of this deal .
my party is in favour of cars , as mr verhofstadt , too , is aware .
i am pleased .
nl madam president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you to the commission for its statement .
the commission is now congratulating itself on the work it has done over recent months .
judged against the potential for environmental improvement , its record has been shameful .
of course , there are positive stories to be told .
i think that the european commission must put a stop to this before it is too late .
es madam president , I thank the commissioners for their explanations .
demand cannot keep up with supply .
where state aid in particular is concerned , I believe that we need to prioritise two areas of action .
that is why you were holding up your blue card , is it not ?
i wonder what kind of industrial policy do we want for europe ?
i am even more worried about state aid , which must not distort competition in the car market .
differing ideas have been put forward about how job losses and notice will be distributed .
furthermore , it is important for the commission and parliament to follow the developments closely .
i therefore think that the car industry has an important role to play in connection with regional development .
the commission should do more , including with regard to awarding grants to the car industry .
i am pleased that the rescue succeeded .
this is not to mention the supply chain , where large numbers of jobs will also be lost .
these are all social tragedies , and I believe that three things are important in this regard .
we need the facts and figures .
we will go as fast as the provision of information allows us .
i am aware that is also what the honourable member wants .
we take the points about speed and being very careful but precise and going into great depth .
that is fundamental and what the commission is absolutely engaged in .
that is one of the main things we owe to the people who are currently living in uncertainty .
however , there are also reservations about handing over more power to the commission in the civil protection sector .
everyone knows how important intervention was both in the case of the tsunami and during hurricane katrina .
this is a systemic disaster of massive proportions and will worsen over the next few decades .
for at least six years , we have been talking about a common european civil protection force .
we need a policy of prevention , but also a policy of coordination .
unfortunately , both the main parties have tried to mitigate and reduce the constitutional protection of forests .
climate change can be used to explain the disasters which have occurred in southern europe to a degree .
does it intend to finance appropriate reforestation , because there is too little reforestation to replace the damage ?
i understand , commissioner , that you are having problems from northern europe as far as subsidiarity is concerned .
for the time being , we have this small unit based in corsica .
let me move on to the commission's observations .
i presented this report on 9 may 200mrs tzavela , obviously , it is not just greece .
then you will see that this affects everyone .
with climate change and global warming , the future does not look any brighter .
even so , we still have fires .
there are several documents that point to solutions .
what is the commission going to do in this regard ?
therefore , having adopted this resolution , this is undoubtedly the challenge for parliament .
the european institutions cannot be incapable once more of finding an adequate solution for those who are affected .
the spanish presidency must also make a clear commitment to developing a common european strategy .
firstly , responsiveness .
we are told that it is the member states that must decide .
let us therefore ensure that the budget our budget genuinely takes account of this problem .
we call on the council to finally release these funds without obstacles .
the regions need the money urgently for reconstruction and for prevention .
europe , too , must do more , however , above all , in terms of better coordination .
i think it is too early to be discussing disaster prevention as a european competence .
why can we not do so in relation to offering protection against fires ?
i can , of course , provide europe with this example , which may be of use .
they can find no direct link to climate change as yet .
with climate change , natural conditions will change that is a fact .
as the commissioner said , coordination is vital .
that causes problems in land development , reforestation and fire prevention policy .
we have here a good resolution .
the exchange of expertise , deployment particularly in the wider region itself , should constitute these foundations .
this is not a matter for centralised control , but must be decentralised to member states .
mr president , I was listening to this debate in my office .
deal with those who deliberately destroy .
emergencies often involve a high human , financial and environmental cost .
one is mobilisation of the community mechanism for civil protection and the other is activation of the solidarity fund .
europe needs to show solidarity in the face of such natural disasters .
in addition , there was a special focus on rules .
we are aware of the sensitivities of the car sector .
tariffs will only be eliminated in year five of the agreement , and that allows time for adjustment .
on duty drawback , my final point , this is nothing new .
such policies are legitimate under the world trade organisation .
and we have negotiated a special clause that would enable us to limit duty drawback efficiently .
that is certainly a novelty something that I think virtually none of us have encountered before .
today , the bulk of these issues have still not been addressed .
i will cite just one example to illustrate our fears .
do you envisage a renegotiation of the controversial points that I have just mentioned ?
or are such bilateral agreements merely a supplement to or expansion of the european union's free trade policy ?
thank you for your answer .
mr president , I must say I am rather concerned about the tone of this debate .
with the exception , perhaps , of daniel caspary's contribution , it has been rather negative .
this is an important agreement , where europe has achieved its strategic objectives .
they concluded that full membership of the eu would cost them up to six times their current bilateral arrangements .
the swiss being the swiss decided that they were better off by not joining or achieving full eu membership .
korea is a serious market .
we are , in fact , an economic superpower .
the question about duty drawback is , for me , a very simple one .
written statements rule 149 
let us leave it to those whose job it is and who do it with professionalism journalists .
developing countries need us now more than ever .
however , developed countries are beginning to come out of the crisis .
nothing justifies a reduction in public development aid .
however , as has already been said , several european countries have announced drastic cuts .
i should like to hear your opinion on a whole series of points .
you also responded in favour of combating tax havens .
to my mind , this is obviously important , as others have said .
looking forward to pittsburgh , that would seem to me to be the big danger .
i also believe we should focus on decreasing dependence on humanitarian aid for some of the beneficiaries .
human lives are not just threatened by floods , but also by the insidious and permanent threat of drought .
i would like to emphasise the regular control of finances both by donors and recipients of funding .
it is their responsibility .
i would even say , to the contrary .
several members have also insisted on the reform of the international financial institutions .
that is my explanation to your question .
the economic situation looked significantly more worrying six months ago , but it seems to have stabilised .
the challenges we face with regard to the climate will require new resources and the redistribution of existing resources .
the logic behind our draft general budget is quite simple .
otherwise , we will not be able to take the gradual steps towards balancing public finances once again .
eight percent !
under sub heading 1b , the council accepted the commitment appropriations proposed by the commission .
the council therefore secured a margin of around eur 310 million in its first reading .
however , there are some particular concerns which I would like to highlight .
it was encouraging that the european commission and council expressed their agreement with it .
researchers born and trained in europe are working outside the european union .
what can we do now ?
i call on my fellow members , the council and commission to support this .
one example of this is the security for the buildings in which we are conducting these debates today .
another example is the court of auditorsreports on translations .
there are many similar examples .
we wanted to adopt a sensible decision on this matter in the first reading .
our financial contribution to the economic recovery will represent scarcely 0.03 % of the union's gdp .
there is no alternative .
your predecessor is , today , the head of state in lithuania .
an important element in dealing with migratory flows is border control .
since its launch in 2005 , frontex's capacity has been progressively expanded .
this dialogue must be based on the principles of solidarity and shared responsibility .
since then , the commission has been working on three major themes .
that is all as regards asylum .
there you have it .
our member states still need to show the full solidarity and the determination necessary to implement this strategy .
allow me to give an example .
therefore , we must keep the complexity of the subject in mind at all times .
i would like to mention some other points .
these are initiatives that need to be put into place instantly .
as a result , we need a common policy , which has still not been developed .
however , it is clear that the response must be coherent with the european identity .
the response must involve legal migration , as an alternative to illegal immigration .
you will recall that many hundreds of migrants perished off the libyan coast .
on 25 august , 57 eritrean migrants were finally rescued after a lengthy spell in maltese waters .
we must act more strongly against the various third countries that irresponsibly encourage those activities .
i therefore call for serious consideration to be given to repealing thisdirective of shame.
britain does not need a common european immigration policy .
what we need to do is end mass immigration now and introduce a strictly limited and controlled immigration policy .
nl mr president , frontex is not working .
it is money down the drain .
the dutch party for freedom , on whose behalf I am speaking , is vehemently opposed to this policy .
let there be an end to it then .
the party for freedom rejects this out of hand .
let there be an end to mass immigration it has gone far enough .
this would be unacceptable , because there are many challenges and missions to be tackled .
it is important that you restated it .
it is important that we uphold these human rights .
frontex therefore needs to be part of a fair and balanced approach to migration and asylum .
this is not true .
such disarray is unacceptable .
why cannot we have some transparency and clarity about frontex and what they are doing ?
we need some obligation here .
pl we want to fight immigration .
migration is , of course , one of the greatest problems facing europe today .
these countries do not only include libya .
can you tell us why you are not introducing compulsory solidarity here too ?
do we really think , mr billström , that all this responsibility can be shouldered by individual states ?
what provisions are you making to ensure real solidarity and real solutions to the suffering of migrants ?
within this cooperation , as the debate has illustrated , libya and turkey have prime position .
the new democracy meps have exercised parliamentary scrutiny .
as for readmission and relocation , we must reinforce frontex still further and organise joint return flights .
the problem is very acute .
for years we have been aware that frontex has violated human rights in individual cases .
the criminal networks that exploit people's desperation must be tackled .
the swedish presidency will organise a special conference in brussels on this issue and the fight against human trafficking .
it requires a package of various initiatives within different areas .
increased cooperation with the countries of origin and transit is particularly important .
the division of responsibility between the countries with regard to sea rescue efforts also needs to be clarified .
i think that this debate has clearly shown that .
applause 
in short , we are ensuring that this duty of protection is upheld .
to conclude , I should like to reiterate that we need a european strategy on migratory movements .
there you have it I am not going to prolong these answers .
i have taken many notes during the various speeches that have been made .
we believe in these values .
i am grateful , in any case , to the european parliament for helping us in this difficult task .
some members have voiced the idea of establishingillegal immigrant quotas.
this is a step forward towards managing all borders .
ec china agreement maritime transport operations accession of bulgaria and romania 
mobilisation of the european union solidarity fund 
i voted in favour of the mobilisation of these funds .
we must stop this development from going any further immediately .
in january 2009 , france was hit by a severe storm .
indeed , it would be unacceptable if only the private sector were to benefit from it .
this report contained provisions related to this situation .

the prospect of the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon will increase this trend spectacularly .
that , in my view , is a modern take on political action .
mr president , I endorse the comments made by mr daul .
this is why I would say that you are right .
our group can fully identify with the programme you announced .
i can only say , mr president , that we face major challenges .
on behalf of my group , I look forward to some exciting and , hopefully , productive debates .
applause 
mr president , your election was an historic moment .
applause 
mr president , I would once again like to congratulate you on your election .
in reality , agreements are made behind closed doors .
the people of europe need a different policy .
we have to suffer the consequences of this .
we currently have many proposals for the additional monitoring of our citizens .
freedom of expression must also apply on the internet .
it is an onerous task , but I am certain that you will make every effort to accomplish it .
i am convinced that the european parliament rests safe in your hands .
that is why I want to reiterate my willingness to work together to advance european parliamentary democracy .
pl mr president , I congratulate you on your election , and on a good speech .
the european parliament has a particular responsibility to show concern for democratic procedures in that country .
the reason for this is that there is no equality of rights .
mr lindblad , the state secretary , mentioned that equality of rights was the budget's fundamental principle .
if this really is the case , why is there no equality of rights with regard to agricultural subsidies ?
mr president , you have encouraged everyone to use their mother tongue .
it is , in fact , a slovak european union dispute as it involves a country flouting fundamental european values .
during the last century , five official languages were learnt in the lower carpathians region .
why am I mentioning this ?
mr president , thank you for your speech .
i believe , however , that our paths diverge considerably .
it remains the wrong path for europe and europe's nations .
they were promised a referendum by the labour government , and the labour government should fulfil that promise .
until now , we have only been equal , but we would like to be more equal .
in other words , you are assuming a mediating role in dealing with national minority matters .
thank you for your attention and I wish you every success .
cs it was john stuart mill who said that parliament should be a mirror of national life .
if we cannot achieve this in europe , then who can ?
we should explain with greater conviction that we can work on resolving our problems with confidence .
hu hungary commemorated the 1956 revolution and fight for freedom on 23 october 200absolute terror reigned in the country .
many hundreds of people were put in prison and had sham criminal proceedings brought against them .
this ended only recently with them all being released , virtually without exception .
i am thinking of the gas pipeline , because you spoke about energy policy .
there is also the question of enlargement of the european union what about ukraine ?
i do not forget where I have come from , but time is moving on so quickly .
mr schulz stressed that it is a two and a half year programme .
the voice of the citizens has enormous significance here .
why ? because we need greater contact with the citizens .
this is really what it was about .
mrs harms and I have the same opinion on the issue of our climate .
we were both in bali , we were both in poznań , and we will both be in copenhagen .
mr kamiński stressed that we have different views on the future of europe .
mr speroni spoke about appropriate and worthy cooperation with the european commission and the european council .
please remember that parliament is growing in significance .
the treaty of lisbon guarantees us considerably more powers than we have at present .
let us endeavour to make the impossible become possible .
there is also a very important programme the stockholm programme .
let us remember this .
our neighbours are found around the mediterranean sea and in eastern europe .
however , let us not contend with one another in this way .
it is very important that we maintain a balance .
mrs lichtenberger spoke of the role of parliament when we make law .
mr balczó asks if a unified europe really does exist to the extent that I said in my speech .
we will endeavour to achieve this .
i wanted to stress this very strongly .
mr tannock mentioned a human rights commissioner .
you spoke very wisely .
i agree .
i am counting on this completely , and I understand that all of us areenergetic.
mr ransdorf does really represent the citizens and the life of the nation .
i agree , and this is why the responsibility and the powers of the european parliament are growing .
yes , over here it was attractive , but over there we were striving for freedom .
i can also meet with you to discuss this so that I have an understanding of this matter .
mr tőkés spoke about 1956 and hungary .
we all care very much about those events , and about our profound faith in the eu .
yes , I , too , believe deeply in the strength of the european union .
they remain in force nothing has changed here .
this is why I propose most definitely a common energy policy .
furthermore , we are going to meet regularly .
written statements rule 149 
i congratulate you on your election to the position of president of the european parliament .
this is an important moment in the history of european integration .
i believe that this will indeed happen .
this vision of the future of europe is attractive to very many europeans .
thank you very much .
applause 
this includes , in particular , minorities , gays , roma and jews .
there were indeed problems .
this party received 430 000 votes in hungary .
you are therefore calling 430 000 voters fascist .

the next item is the statement by the president designate of the commission .
we have experience .
now is not the time for the status quo , or routine .
in the interests of transparency , I would like to highlight those areas with all of you now .
we must reinvigorate our inclusive social market economy .
but we cannot return to the previous growth model .
yes , we need to map out a genuine european agenda .
we cannot allow a return tobusiness as usual.
in the guidelines , I emphasise the importance of services of general interest for our european model of society .
this also includes the question of own resources .
this will reflect the central priority I attach to research and innovation .
what I propose is no less than a transformational agenda for europe .
we are indeed living in very exceptional times , times of uncertainty and power shifts .
there is a real danger that our achievements in european integration are called into question .
it is this pioneering europe that will be the role model at the copenhagen conference .
obviously , the president of the commission could not represent a single party .
obviously , he must compromise with a college of commissioners belonging to several political families .
applause 
we could have started with a different majority .
however , you have hardly started to concentrate on one programme before you begin doing something different .
it is about the direction of europe as a whole and that is not your decision alone .
therefore , for us it is also a question of programme related issues .
you have said that you will put them in place .
there is a way to get there .
this is intended to enliven our debates .
heckling 
he has been here for a while ?
it is not very responsible .
wait two weeks , three weeks , two months , until they come with proposals ?
our support is very clear .
you are going to get a roasting !
josé manuel obama yes , he can !
the banks why did they go crazy ?
because we have a system that makes them completely crazy .
why ?
for the simple reason that it is about having more and more , and still more , more quickly .
there needs to be a measure , and here I am hallucinating even more .
you talked about the lisbon process .
you talked about research .
then , with the crises , you suddenly realised that it did not work like that .
is mr barnier going to get the internal market ?
what is he going to give to the germans ?
what is he going to give to the british ?
there are , unfortunately , many questions on which we do not agree .
the political system must take responsibility , learn from its mistakes and give up its neo liberal ideals .
i would like to illustrate our political disagreement using some examples .
you want to adhere to the lisbon strategy .
we expect the new commission to restructure the posting of workers directive .
europe must finally give a guarantee that social rights will not be sacrificed to the competitive approach .
i think that you could , for example , by means of the employment policy guidelines .
we are calling for a ban on particularly risky forms of investment and a tax on capital movements .
you , and I quote ,support every paragraph of the treaty of lisbon.
you have been in charge of overseeing that the constitutional treaty was pushed through .
but things went wrong , did they not ?
you have overseen the lisbon agenda it was sunk without trace way before the credit crunch hit us .
hu mr president , europe has reached an historic turning point .
they want to combat the gross injustices of neoliberalism and global big capital .
to be able to do this , they are in huge need of human rights .
the discussion and speeches here are undeniably more dynamic and entertaining than back home in sweden .
there are just two things I would like to say .
he has our clear support to lead the commission for another term .
my second comment is also self evident , but it bears repeating .
we are living in extremely uncertain times with considerable and difficult challenges .
the commission does not and has never advocated the privatisation of public services .
this is very important .
everyone should assume their responsibilities .
without that freedom of circulation , we are not going to have a europe .
fr and , mr cohn bendit , I wish to tell you something .
i do not have an obsession with you .
applause 
this is important .
a party put forward a candidate before the elections .
it is up to you to vote for me .
this may not be the best news for everyone , but I believe in it .
i am proposing to you now a new ambition for europe .
this is the first time that we have had this enlarged europe .
i make no apology for having loyally worked alongside these heads of state or government .
maybe we should change this in future , but for now we must observe the rules .
i would like to add no strong european commission .
the commission president has a great deal of the primary responsibility .
that is the next chapter in our book .
what about protecting the climate ?
telling us that you do not exclude the possibility of one is simply not enough this time .
thirdly , your transformational agenda is the agenda of the past .
we cannot start work on this next year we must begin immediately .
we expect that a common strategy will be developed jointly with the member states .
we want him to have genuine authority .
i read president barroso's political guidelines with great interest .
it was time to discuss issues and you had some tough questions , from me among others .
the president cut off the speaker 
unfortunately , president barroso , in a democracy you cannot please everyone .
some people do not like you because you are too european , and others because of ideological prejudice .
others want to postpone the decision .
good luck , president barroso , and success in your work .
in the next few weeks , you will have the time to prove that you really take this seriously .
these members will support you tomorrow .
we believe that the commission is rather less strong today than it was five years ago .
we need properly coordinated economic and fiscal policies in europe .
this allowed the european union financial sector to invest most profitably in those countries .
a speedier introduction of the euro in these countries would reduce these costs and create stability .
what kind of rights are these , when they are rejected out of hand in the name of solidarity ?
ukip places sovereignty and the citizen's rights above solidarity .
they would probably have listened to you today and seen that you promised everything to everyone .
hopefully , they would also find out what you did five years ago .
that was when you promised most people a very great deal .
i believe that is very , very little .
i want to make that quite clear .
fourthly and finally , we want a fundamentally new version of the interinstitutional agreements .
under these conditions , the five year period of office will be a positive one .
the president cut off the speaker 
it applies only to questions to the previous speaker , not for statements .
apologies for cutting you off .
you must be aware that the problems you raised do not arise in all member states .
i remember the first delors commission had no women and the second had only one .
i am committed to social cohesion .
there is a contradiction there , so let us be honest about it .
of course it is a compromise , but europe only works as a compromise .
europe cannot work on fanaticism , or on dogmatism .
i thank the epp for the support it has given me .
are you ?
the president cut off the speaker 
between 2002 and 2006 , 728 people were transferred to guantánamo via portuguese airspace .
we grew up in peace .
unfortunately , europe does not have a culture of achievement .
remain open minded and do not propose a european tax because it will provoke a pitchfork revolution against europe .
i have never seen a demonstration in favour of a european tax .
when it comes down to it , we all have very little influence .
why do you not use plain language ?
sv mr president , europe today is a continent defined by peace and democracy .
this was not the case 20 years ago , either , when europe was divided into east and west .
our generation has a responsibility to manage our continent and preserve and strengthen an open and democratic europe .
here are some guiding principles for the continuation of your work .
you need to do more in this regard .
the eu does not need more institutional power struggles .
preserve us from that fate !
i hope that you will then ensure that there are as many women as men in the new commission .
this concept appears to harbour serious dangers in terms of worker protection .
part time employment , for example , is fine when it is the worker's choice .
in the past , far right extremists concealed their faces under various different masks and guises .
are you that leader , mr barroso ?
however , you have taken a great interest in my constituency of northern ireland .
for this commitment I thank you .
we value the support and close working relationship of commission officials at all levels with northern ireland .
you will know about the huge potential for the economy through the development of tourism .
as many in this chamber have said already today , it is actions and delivery that count .
es madam president , commission president , I want to make a preliminary comment .
we are not only experiencing an economic and financial crisis , but also a crisis of values .
the second point , which I also support , is mr barroso's european ambition .
this is why we hope that the treaty of lisbon will be ratified .
it is a tool box that will make the institutions work .
we need a strong commission that can confront the crisis as quickly as possible .
the third reason is a contract of confidence that we have signed with you .
in this respect , an important role will be played by the agency for the cooperation of energy regulators .
energy security also depends on the eu's neighbours .
for this we need an industrial policy to be adopted .
the citizens need to be set an example of solidarity in order to combat the crisis .
to carry on as before is disastrous , said the philosopher , walter benjamin .
finally , over the last six weeks , you have struck me as a man with passion and enthusiasm .
institutionally speaking , we are on the way from nice to lisbon .
whether these are dangers or opportunities depends to a great extent on ourselves .
that is my hope .
in this area , we are faced with several new challenges .
mt madam president , mr barroso , financial and economic challenges have been extensively discussed .
we had the tampere programme , the hague programme , and now that of stockholm .
i believe that we must invest renewed energy in this field .
are you satisfied with your achievements over the past five years ?
what do you think you need to change about the way in which you go about your work ?
you clearly want to lead the commission of a european union that numbers 500 million people .
what additional efforts will your commission make in order to speed up this process ?
we are confident not only in you , but also in this parliament .
madam president , this vote tomorrow is very much a vote about the standing of the european parliament .
good luck tomorrow .
applause 
the geopolitical framework has undergone radical change .
the committee on petitions is the first point of contact between the european institutions and citizens .
however , I question the european union's financial standing as regards all of your projects .
some of my fellow members have already stressed this point .
it is true that the crisis is putting the member statesbudgets under pressure at the moment .
i would like to thank the european commission for working with us .
firstly , that of presenting competition as an absolute and insurmountable dogma .
pl madam president , europe is united .
however , europe is also diversified .
the common agricultural policy actually sanctions two europes the old and the new .
this requires changes and the creation of a genuine , unified , united and cohesive europe .
it is easy to criticise but we have to give credit where credit is due .
i am greatly in favour of your further term and I will vote for it .
i have one specific comment we know mr barroso's position on the modified policies .
madam president , I would first of all like to wish mr barroso well for tomorrow in the vote .
i know it is difficult to try and pinpoint any one individual state .
in this respect , I call for this temporary support to become permanent support .
those opposing the treaty in ireland are spreading scurrilous information about the minimum wage to be eur 1.8people speak of green shoots as part of the economic recovery in europe .
the investment community and people who create jobs want the lisbon treaty enacted .
these guarantees are important to us .
de madam president , the european union is suffering from a dramatic democratic deficit .
these warnings were definitely made .
hu thank you for this opportunity to speak .
i would like to ask president barroso two questions .
it is as simple as that .
many questions focused on energy security those of mr saryusz wolski , mr marinescu and others .
what are the chinese doing ?
of course , we have problems in europe , consistency problems .
you all know where this crisis came from .
immediately after , we reacted .
it was europe that instigated this response .
therefore I do not need anyone's advice on how to show commitment to fundamental rights .
thank you , anyway .
that is obvious .
mrs int veld told me that I had not convinced her .
you are very difficult to convince , mrs int veld .
i believe that it would be a mistake to start by talking about the amounts for the future budget .
we are world leaders when it comes to financial services .
what is the point of handing over the leadership to dubai ?
i do not see what the point would be .
europe is very diverse .
i can assure you of that .
some of them are still here .
i am grateful to you .
i think highly of parliament .
some say you are too close to the governments.
i am a politician I am not a technocrat or a bureaucrat .
applause 
he has given us information which is very important , both for us and for our citizens .
that , however , is not and never has been the only possible direction .
part one
the textile and clothing sector comes from decades of managed trade .
today european textiles are known in the world for their innovation and technical performance .
i therefore ask you what specifically is going to be done .
that is precisely what we are seeking to do .
subject eu priorities for intergovernmental conference on climate change
the eu has offered to take up a 30 % reduction target if others make comparable commitments .
these plans would then form the basis for targeted financial and other support .
adequate international financing will be essential to reach an effective agreement in copenhagen .
perhaps you could tell us more about this .
would it be possible to increase the aid for developing countries ?
concrete actions and procedures have already been put in place to speed up delivery of aid .
the prime responsibility for delivering on the oda commitments lies with the member states themselves .
pl thank you for your explanation .
subject demographics and development policy in africa
in particular , the education of women has an impact on their reproductive behaviour .
however , in developing countries this demographic increase is particularly large , with social and economic consequences too .
the problem of overpopulation in africa is clearly limited to individual countries .
to what extent are these facts influencing the development policy of the european union ?
this is not a new phenomenon .
we have seen it in all countries all over the globe .
it is rather a phenomenon that is linked to the development of the country concerned .
serious concerns remain concerning the effective application of the ilo core conventions in the country .
twenty seven trade unionists have been murdered since the beginning of january 200i am very pleased that mr higgins has asked his question .
subject international trade recovery
can the commission provide the following information 
subject marketing european beef and lamb products
can I ask the commissioner if she would consider a thorough and full examination of the food promotion budget ?
it is well known that european beef and lamb products comply with the highest standards .
indeed , it is an area where we have increasingly to look and focus .
consequently , there is also money from this source .

g20 summit in pittsburgh 24 25 september debate 
we will hold an informal european council in brussels tomorrow to prepare the eu's common position .
firstly , rapid and forceful financial and monetary policy measures to support the financial sector and the real economy .
the g20 process has had the following significant results 
that is why the presidency is inviting the heads of state or government to a dinner tomorrow evening .
we have only just begun to reflect on these exit strategies .
the european union has played an active and decisive role in encouraging the g20 in this respect .
this is an aspiration that the european union supports , but it must be translated into concrete agreements .
it is a summit where decisions have to be taken .
commissioner almunia , you said that there are proposals in place for hedge funds .
that is the most important message this parliament can give the pittsburgh delegates .
it is good to start with the bonus systems , but it is not enough .
nor should you be frightened of discussing fiscal policy it is not prohibited .
we want a number of the g20's elements and commitments to be formalised .
please help us to take advantage of this experience .
we cannot get out of this on our own .
europe must hammer home this message tirelessly .
secondly , we must successfully put in place effective supervision and a much more demanding form of bank stabilisation .
i have several concerns .
the first is that the committee on development in this house drafted a motion for a resolution .
a global financial system needs transparency .
they should do anything that can be seen if they want people to believe in them .
the reality is that high finance gives the orders and politics obeys them .
my second observation is that we must not fall for gimmicks .
the fire appears to have been put out , but the foundations of our financial system are still shaky .
i am expecting specific and fast measures from the gi hope that the eu member states will all pull together .
mr president , so far the g20 has concentrated on measures for the financial sector .
i have deep respect for small enterprises which , against all odds , try to survive .
that will be one of the controversial questions at the g20 summit .
we must also take employment into consideration .
these are the people's real needs .
the crisis is not over .
furthermore , commissioner , minister , please do not forget in pittsburgh that europe exists .
i have here the letter of 3 september from the three european prime ministers .
for this we need a consistent approach .
firstly , we need more europe .
if we fail to achieve this , europe will not count and will not be involved .
secondly , we need more state .
fr mr president , you spoke of the governance of the imf .
what is the council's position ?
our economies are still very fragile .
i firmly believe that we must take action against such trends .
they are completely at the mercy of the banks , which do not provide sufficient reliable information .
do you not think we should tackle this issue ?
many members have raised the issues that both I and the commissioner have looked at .
yes , we need better supervision and better regulation of the financial markets .
we hope that a supervisory system can be put in place as soon as possible .
we will base this on the larosière report and see how quickly we can get it into place .
we need more coordinated global solutions and effective and functioning international institutions .
we would also like to take up the matter of climate financing .
we will be having a special discussion on unemployment at ecofin in october .
many members have raised the matter of hedge funds and new financial regulation .
these are priority issues for the swedish presidency .
in summary , naturally the g20 summit cannot solve all the problems that we have discussed .
thank you very much for a highly interesting debate .
however , without a functioning financial system , nothing else can be sustained .
the debate is closed .
it is expected that the approaching g20 summit will place a predominant emphasis on the copenhagen climate talks .
number three . flexibility mechanisms must continue to be given an important role .
at present , four of them have already achieved this .
mr president , the market economy is a good slave but a bad master .
i think , however , that we should at least look into how relevant they might be .
there have already been steps taken in this direction .
in writing . I agree with those who spoke about the need for a global co ordinated approach .
this week marks the anniversary of the collapse of lehman brothers .
transparency is essential if we are to bring consumer confidence back to the banking sector .
this is indeed what will happen .
allow me to mention certain other provisions that we will demand are included in the agreement .
firstly , there must be a balance between civil security and civil rights .
but there are some key questions left open .
to which judge can an eu citizen or an eu enterprise go in the case of criminal prosecution ?
mr president , after all these warm words , I am going to put a cat among the pigeons !
for me , that is a little bit back to front .
it was known back in 2007 that the architecture of swift needed to be reformed .
in fact , however , fundamental rights are being eroded and proper public debate on them frustrated .
it is not enough to just tap at the door a responsible parliament must stop this undesirable development .
we greens will have nothing to do with this .
i will try to answer some of the questions in the short time available .
in order for this to happen , we need an agreement .
that is what I have attempted to describe .
mr president , I have a small point of order .
the debate is closed .
eu strategy for the baltic sea area debate 
this is a very sensitive marine environment that is exposed to various kinds of environmental impact .
decisive efforts are needed , and quickly .
the economic crisis has made the matter of jobs and growth highly topical .
our aims and goals in this respect are clear .
we must address the crisis by increasing cooperation and commitment in our immediate area .
global competitiveness requires cross border cooperation between countries and enterprises , in research and through innovations .
the aim of the strategy for the baltic sea area is not to create new institutions .
i would also like to express my special gratitude to commission president barroso .
the eu and member states have to agree on providing alternative channels for energy deliveries .
europe has already invested eur 200 million in the safety of this power plant .
i do not think so .
following this sacrifice , lithuania will find it considerably harder to overcome the economic crisis .
unemployment in the country will grow even more and poverty will increase .
this is an area with 100 million inhabitants and an investment budget of eur 50 billion .
here I would like to underline the role the then commissioner mrs danuta hübner played in drafting this strategy .
this policy is now being continued by commissioner samecki , to whom I also extend my heartfelt congratulations .
let us hope that this one works well .
the baltic sea is suffering two major acute environmental problems .
the problem is that the baltic sea needs a healthy ecosystem .
at present large volumes of young cod that have just arrived in the baltic sea are being dumped .
i call on the swedish presidency to take up my challenge and deal with this problem .
our second priority is further infrastructure development .
however , not all the recommendations of this house have been accepted by the commission .
the commission assures us that funding will come from existing instruments , primarily the structural funds .
the authors of the strategy mention the need for close cooperation with russia .
fi mr president , the european union became aware of the baltic sea issue quite late on .
during its presidency , sweden has also integrated these regional policy matters closely with this baltic sea strategy .
some of the region's member states , including latvia , have been severely hit by the economic crisis .
our financial sector is interconnected with the scandinavian one .
this means that our problems will create problems there , so this is not a national issue .
without proper financing , however , the project will not succeed .
the president cut off the speaker 
eur 55 million has been earmarked for the region under the existing budgetary framework .
mrs hassi and mrs lövin mentioned the matter of the marine environment , agriculture and fisheries .
naturally it is related to the baltic sea , but it is not part of the strategy .
however , it is to be agreed in the future work related to the implementation of the strategy .
second point on management and governance .
i think that we should not delude ourselves .
the responsibilities of member states , of the commission and of other organisations involved in the management .
written statements rule 149 
in writing . the baltic sea strategy promoted by the swedish presidency is very welcome .
there is , however , one aspect of the development of the baltic sea region that demands urgent reconsideration .
it is not such a bad idea , is it , ladies and gentlemen ?
today's agenda includes electing the president of the european commission .
as usual , in the vote you may vote for or against the candidate , or abstain .
the vote is held 
mr president , I know that you are aware of the priorities of the european parliament .
congratulations , and all the best !
applause 
this was the official statement related to the election of mr barroso as president of the european commission .
forest fires in the summer of 2009 vote 
in 2008 , we waited in vain for president barroso to call for order .
it is difficult for those who have the floor to speak with this din all around .
many people believe that smart regulation is bad regulation , or that any regulation is not very smart regulation .
the european commission's policy needs to be reoriented .
mr barroso is not the man for the job .
this value has been acknowledged by the european parliament in this vote .
the text you sent us does not make this clear .
i voted in favour of appointing mr barroso as president of the european commission .
in my understanding of democracy , election winners can claim the right to choose one of their own .
there is no other choice but mr barroso no alternative solution has been seriously considered .
the europe of the 12 , of kohl and mitterrand , is no more and will doubtless never return .
i hope it will be so and I want to give him the credit for this .
to postpone this vote one more time would be to bark up the wrong tree .
the european union should repay this friendship and thus support the future of rural areas .
it does not , however , explain environmental disasters , especially if the same phenomena recur every few years .
we must say straightaway that preventing natural disasters and adapting to climate change is not an easy task .
for me , two proposals seem essential to improve the situation .
i voted in favour of the resolution on forest fires .
in april 2009 , the number of fires was the highest in five years .
we need to set up a european reaction force capable of acting quickly in case of natural disasters .
the devastation to many sites of natural beauty is a loss to us all .
cecilia malmström , the minister for european affairs , will sign on behalf of the council .
i am very pleased that commissioner benita ferrero waldner is also with us today .
these acts are aimed at stabilising the financial markets .
you will all be present at the signing , and the minister and I will sign .
we shall now proceed to the signing .
composition of interparliamentary delegations see minutes
12475 / 2004 11803 / 2004 c6 0118 / 2005 .
the second round of this dialogue will take place in dushanbe on 23 september .
we must continue to encourage tajikistan to introduce a programme of reforms .
it is hindering not only development in tajikistan , but also effective contributions from donors .
we welcome tajikistan's interest in cooperation and support its efforts .
that is positive .
it is a territory vulnerable to spill over from these conflict areas and to infiltration by islamic militants .
a key element in tajikistan's vulnerabilities is its weak economy .
i believe that we are now on the right track with tajikistan , supporting and encouraging indispensable reforms .
above all , I would like to thank the embassy of the republic of tajikistan for their cooperation .
tajikistan has come in for a lot of criticism for its lack of democracy .
in addition , it is a relatively stable country , which is important , considering its strategic location .
i am pleased in this respect that the report also mentions the millennium development goals .
the european union is tajikistan's primary trading partner .
merely criticising what is wrong in tajikistan will not achieve this .
it was also excellent to hear that an ombudsman's institution had been established in tajikistan .
central asia is a region vital to the eu's political and energy security .
the problem has already been addressed here in general terms .
madam president , quite honestly , this debate gives me mixed feelings .
i have just heard it again in a debate and I absolutely cannot understand where this idea comes from .
what I read in paragraph 2 about the disappointment of the tajik government I find entirely astonishing .
i hope , commissioner , that this is also followed up on conscientiously .
madam president , I am very much in favour of this agreement .
tajikistan is at the crossroads of drug trafficking from afghanistan to europe and russia .
mr peterle deals with all this very systematically in his report .
i am pleased that the european parliament is still holding the banner high as regards human rights .
mrs hautala brought up the matter of water .
this is a very important issue .
i am sure that the commission will return to this later .
as mr tannock rightly said , we should not marginalise tajikistan .
on the contrary , I think we should engage with this poorest country of central asia .
so we know that this is an extremely important issue .
for that , we have introduced bomka , the border management programme .
that is excellent because it works against smuggling .
i have visited those institutions myself and I can tell you they are working very well .
let me say a second word on the human rights question .
water has also been mentioned .
not least , visa liberalisation will create new opportunities for trade , industry and transfer of know how .
where kosovo is concerned , the commission's proposal involves no change .
the commission proposal has been submitted to the council .
as for montenegro , a lasting solution must be found for displaced persons .
we all stand for this .
however , the citizens in the european union equally expect security .
we should not give these states a free rein .
the rules of play are clear and anyone who abides by them has every chance of having visas waived .
it is not as if there are no anomalies at present .
the process would be exactly the same , though a bit later .
i cannot believe the commission and the council intend to pursue this damaging path .
they are already issuing biometric passports and have made about the same amount of progress on the other criteria .
in this regard , we need to consistently hold up definite european prospects before them .
however , the wounds are far from healed and every measure by the eu is being evaluated accordingly .
visa liberalisation in the western balkans is not a jigsaw puzzle with which you might wish to amuse yourselves .
that would be good for all the three countries and for the western balkans as a whole .
the bosniaks are the only people in bosnia who have not been allowed to travel freely throughout europe .
bosnia is close to having its visa requirements lifted .
however , the path on which you have embarked has a number of stumbling blocks .
it will result , above all , in the muslim citizens of bosnia feeling discriminated against .
i think that the wrong wording was chosen in june .
today as we have heard there are still problems in serbia and in montenegro .
technical assistance means a great deal .
i would ask the commission and the council to help these countries .
they have a new government they will manage , but kosovo will only manage if you all help .
it is a very clear political matter .
i am also delighted with this proposal that has been put forward .
it is very important that the three countries are now given visa free travel .
there were already ethnic tensions before the war , but they have still remained following the war .
i am from a generation which grew up with hundreds of thousands of so called yugoslavian foreign workers .
disintegration for kosovo or bosnia would endanger our security more than any technical details .
consequently , I welcome the proposal on visa liberalisation for serbia , macedonia and montenegro .
the conditions must be met .
let us not make this more of a political issue than is necessary , however .
i believe that freedom of movement is the gateway to democracy and knowledge .
in your decision , you will certainly draw up a recommendation for speeding up this process .
the timescales must correspond to these checks , which should be speeded up if possible .
how can it be possible , then , that the proposals threaten to isolate the bosnian muslims ?
great inequality is arising within a single country , as serbian and croatian bosnians do receive a passport .
who will stand up for the bosnian muslims ?
will the council ?
i call on the commission to include bosnia and herzegovina within the visa free zone as soon as possible .
however , we are holding back hundreds of thousands of those who have good intentions .
that applies whether we are talking about visas or accession .
they have not been forgotten , however .
we must give a clear political signal that the opportunity is there for them to be included .
madam president , I would firstly like to mention that this is a groundbreaking step .
we must be particularly mindful of this .
there is , therefore , a process in motion which does not aim to discriminate against anyone .
we simply want the road map's objective criteria to be observed increasingly .
that is what we want .
there is no question of discriminating against the 25 or 30 % of muslim albanians in macedonia .
macedonia , serbia and montenegro have definitely taken the turning for the european union .
their governments have demonstrated that they share the same values as we do .
the balkan countries are an integral part of europe .
this process must be resolutely continued .
it is about european values .
it will expose young and vulnerable gay , lesbian and transgender people to bullying and exclusion .
we are all europeans .
according to this law , factual information on this is supposedly damaging to these young people .
i am delighted that a proposal is on the table today , including a motion for a resolution .
we know how those things begin , and we also know where they always lead .
appoint a committee to see what is and what is not promotion of homosexuality ?
the british conservatives introduced in great britain a similar law in 198it will affect the very way young people and others speak , think and act .
and why ?
so I say to lithuanians and people across europe reject this dangerous step back to the past .
applause 
our union is based on various principles and values that all the member states are expected to support .
the presidency has made this position clear in contacts with the lithuanian government on repeated occasions .
it is up to the commission to judge whether a member state is meeting its obligations under the treaties .
since the law has not yet entered into force , no such proposal has been tabled .
madam president , the minister has explained very well the legal elements of this problem .
these are binding principles of community law .
these amendments should be proposed at the end of october .
the president of the republic of lithuania took the initiative by tabling clarifying amendments immediately .
the possibility of direct promotion to minors has been dealt with by the adoption of a law .
ok , that is the case for you .
madam president , mr landsbergis has given a deeply unconvincing justification of this law .
the council and the commission have expressed their deep concern , and that is the correct line .
anti discrimination and freedom of expression are absolutely fundamental principles in european law .
this is to say that I strongly support the resolution .
this means that this is not an internal issue of lithuanian policy .
another concern of the lithuanian legislators was that children should be brought up according to their parentsconvictions .
we are talking about the eu and the eu's respect for fundamental human rights .
in practice , this proposed legislation risks making any information about lgbt issues illegal .
i hope that parliament will be as unified as possible in voting in favour of this resolution tomorrow .
we have worked for this for many years .
we have the agency for fundamental rights .
it does have a purpose .
i thank all of my fellow members who have put so much into these negotiations .
the voice of non governmental organisations also fell on deaf ears .
at the moment , a similar draft directive is being debated in the council of ministers .
the law in question does not contravene any international standards in the area of human rights .
sv madam president , all people are born equal and have the same inviolable value .
let the members of this house remind each other that the greatest of all is love .
this house is ignoring the legitimacy of a national parliament which has twice voted through the law without criticism .
i have a question what must the irish be thinking ahead of the forthcoming referendum ?
madam president , I fully agree with the minister's conclusions .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday 17 september 200written statements rule 149 
discrimination is prohibited under european and international law .
in 1990 , the world health organisation removed homosexuality from the international statistical classification of diseases and health problems .
it also confirmed that no type of sexual orientation is a disorder .
in any societies , including lithuanian society , there are lesbians , gays and bisexual .
question time council 
the next item is question time b7 0203 / 2009 .
the following questions are addressed to the council .
the council shares the member of parliament's concern regarding animal welfare .
i know that we in ireland have certainly bought into it .
this is what I can say at the moment .
so I think we need to be sensitive to this issue .
as soon as it comes , we will throw ourselves at it and start to discuss it .
i know that this issue is hugely important .
why is that ?
are you going to raise it on another occasion ?
it is very unfortunate that the conference in brussels clashes with the session .
that is why they coincide .
thank you very much for that reply .
i am sad as well that the conference is being held when we are in strasbourg .
one of the most important items on its agenda is reform of the fao .
this was welcomed by the european council in june 200i do appreciate the detailed response .
there are positive reports coming from almost all the different markets .
it touches upon the conference itself but it is , of course , something that goes much further .
subject stability and development pact
thank you very much for your very concise response .
therefore , the proposal to eliminate that has no support from the council .
so the social fund is only one instrument to combat unemployment .
de thank you , mrs malmström .
we intend to have an urgency debate on this matter tomorrow .
madam president , the council is aware of the events brought up by the member of parliament .
the council has worked continually and very actively on her behalf .
furthermore , during this time , the council has taken specific action a number of times .
i would like to thank you , madam president in office , for your comprehensive reply .
the us has a key role to play here .
naturally , we will be discussing these issues at the g20 summit next week .
there is strong interest on both sides in strengthening transatlantic political dialogue and cooperation on development work .
we are firmly convinced that the summit will promote transatlantic relations in a positive and constructive manner .
thank you very much minister .
president in office of the council . this morning we had a debate on the preparations for gthe eu stands united .
we know what we want .
on non proliferation , we are very happy that this is again on the agenda .
we are very process oriented .
questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing see annex .
opening of the sitting
the sitting was opened at 09.00 
the prices paid to milk producers have plummeted everywhere , averaging 24 cents per litre within the european union .
the top line is good news prices are improving .
if I could start with the report , I will look first at state aid .
the second point is streamlining the procedures for responding to prices in the dairy sector .
the dairy sector is in trouble .
the commission really should have acted more swiftly in this regard .
it would also make sense to introduce an early retirement regulation .
that is why we have tabled amendments to this effect and why I welcome your reassurance on this matter .
consumers are losing out as they fail to get the benefits from the fall in milk prices .
farmers are losing out because they do not receive a fair share of the retail milk price .
the european union had counted on growth in world demand .
its experts got it very wrong .
the financial and economic crisis that we are experiencing has direct effects on agriculture and consumption .
on each litre of milk , some small farmers are losing up to 30 cents .
it has terrible consequences in terms of employment and land use patterns .
they sat on their hands for too long , and many farmers have suffered grievously for that .
i think we need to do more in the short term to help the industry through this present crisis .
instead , she wants to continue deregulating the sector against the farmersbest interests .
i consider it necessary .
madam president , I would like to thank the commissioner for her words to us today .
when the dairy sector struggles , the rest of the rural economy struggles .
currently dairy farmers receive just over 20 cents per litre for milk amid escalating costs .
madam president , when farm women start protesting you know there is a serious difficulty .
i want to say that , in relation to the future , your comments are particularly welcome .
we must endorse them and even call for them to be enlarged in scope .
in order to regulate a market , we need public regulation .
financial assistance is required by dairy farmers immediately .
the current situation is unsustainable and requires a political solution .
the opportunity to produce milk should go mainly to producers who have low costs and who achieve a profit .
the margin that the farmer receives is so unfair .
the supermarkets need to reduce their profit margins .
quotas have increased , while production has fallen .
i believe that setting fixed quotas would lead to a rise in prices over time .
because dairy production does not have a tap that we can just turn off and on .
because dairy production does not have a tap that we can just turn off and on willy nilly .
we are hearing over and over again that the adopted milk quota regulations should be amended .
as a dairy farmer myself , I can only warn you against doing this .
i therefore call on the commission to explain how it is going to deal with this problem .
firstly , in my view , the implementation of the super levy at this time would be inappropriate .
that is what I term a dysfunctional price chain mechanism .
it is a shame that no one listened to us .
perhaps you should do so now .
commissioner , you should not pass the buck to member states so that they help whoever they can .
the crisis is caused by an over abundant supply of milk , which is making prices drop sharply .
the market is not working .
this situation is plunging them into further difficulties , and they are unable to meet their obligations .
the crisis has not eased .
we are not the mouthpieces for the farmersinterests .
just now , you listed the measures you have taken in the past nine months .
those measures do exist , we will grant you that .
es we cannot allow the milk sector to collapse .
we must prevent these falling into a negative situation .
this must be corrected .
that was a very poor and short sighted decision .
dairy producers do not need your compassion , commissioner .
they do not need the outmoded liberal theories that have drawn us into an unprecedented world crisis .
we are all deeply shaken by what has happened .
this has to change .
i would like to ask the commissioner to take action on this issue .
in the czech republic we now have fewer cattle than we had after the napoleonic wars .
the president cut off the speaker 
hu mr president , emergency measures are obviously needed , as the situation is disastrous .
we are asking for specific advice or a proposal on how .
so these structural changes are taking place anyway .
i am not going to repeat all the different measures that we have been taking .
we are not introducing a new super levy system .
we have already reserved eur 14 million for promotion for the rest of this year .
so I think there are lots of possibilities .
the debate is closed .
in recent weeks we met with the producers , their organisations and the processing industries .
cash flow in the sector is drying up .
in a market thrown off balance by surpluses , any country that increases its production harms all the others .
without this , prices will become unpredictable .
european dairy producers cannot endure the losses caused by large scale price volatility .
but quotas alone will not save the dairy sector .
processing aids
longer private storage scheme for butter
the survival of milk producers is now seriously under threat .
now it is time to roll up our sleeves and come up with new solutions .
we therefore need to adopt urgent measures to prevent this from happening .
the next item is the commission statement on energy security in relation to the nabucco and desertec projects .
secondly , issues related to sustainability .
for this reason , dialogue with the producer , transit and consumer countries is crucial .
we made a major breakthrough this july .
we have identified three sources that are ready to commit gas volumes .
where are the difficulties ?
we have launched a call for proposals .
first of all , there is the technological development that we have supported for many years .
there are two types of interconnection that we need to separate .
we have supported the integration of markets in north africa for some time .
this house has been a very strong supporter of energy efficiency .
it really is the biggest element .
i believe this is a very good combination , as renewable energy also gives security of supply .
so , diversification also covers supply .
the question of security of supply for our citizens is becoming ever more important .
we are dependent on unstable regions and countries with undemocratic regimes .
this also applies to europe in international relations .
nuclear power has a major role to play because it will help combat the greenhouse effect .
firstly , complacency over energy policy is putting us increasingly in the dangerous position of dependency on russia .
why have they not up to now been involved on an equal footing in the planning and decision making processes ?
the president cut off the speaker 
desertec and nabucco are important instruments in this regard .
this is also an important task for us .
that is why it is important to focus our efforts on improving interconnections within the eu .
however , spain cannot help without improving its interconnection capacity through the pyrenees .
this is linked to my call to reinforce the supply from southern europe .
desertec and nabucco are central to meeting these challenges .
we need to develop renewable energy production solar thermal and other .
deserts get more energy from the sun in six hours than humankind uses in a year .
therefore , we are in favour of diversification and also see the nabucco project as a european priority project .
time will tell whether nabucco will play its part in the european union's foreign and security policy .
that is why I am surprised at the european commission's policy towards russia with regard to this matter .
the commission is gravely mistaken in thinking that south stream is not a rival project to nabucco .
amendments to the treaties are a lesser issue .
de mr president , nabucco was giuseppe verdi's first hugely successful opera .
over the next few years , electricity produced from solar energy will become significantly cheaper .
the entire investment could be used to generate a total of 8 000 megawatts of wind energy .
the commission should be in favour of nabucco .
in relation to many of these there is a connected development issue .
this opportunity must not be squandered .
the first is what are we actually talking about when we talk about energy security and energy ?
if it is to send out messages , with what moral authority are we doing so ?
i just feel we have all missed a great opportunity to have a medium and long term policy .
we need to concern ourselves with concrete matters and work on those .
this also relates to the question of the source of supply and transport routes .
what is the use of wonderful plans if there is no one willing to invest in them ?
companies must be encouraged .
we must guard against believing that we can force everything to happen and predetermine every last detail .
it is therefore extremely important for us to take wise decisions in order to safeguard energy supplies .
we just have to look at the map .
here , too , the eu member states are keen to get involved .
next , how can we guarantee energy security ?
mr piebalgs , congratulations on all that you are doing .
we must therefore prepare to import gas .
this is an excellent project for the euro mediterranean area .
much depends on relations with turkey .
i am pleased that this is exactly what the commissioner underlined today .
we have to achieve a united european energy policy that would coordinate our activity across all energy issues .
thank you for your attention .
we will have to raise an estimated figure of some eur 8 billion for the 3 300 kilometre pipeline .
the original promise was for some eur 30 million .
we need to realise that we have to go further .
the eu must invest more in the diversification of energy supply sources .
there is also a clear strategy in russia to secure its dominance in europe over the gas sector .
we must ensure that the work on the medgaz pipeline is quickly completed .
this situation cannot continue , because if it does it will permanently jeopardise the european union's energy security .
turkey must nail its colours to the mast and put its weight fully behind the nabucco project .
we can only hope that russia will respect the charter and will not take any definitive action .
european gas consumers cannot be left at the mercy of monopolies .
what supporting measures can the european commission take with regard to this ?
we need better gas storage capacity in europe and more integration of our pipeline and electricity grids .
this means that demand will not be met , even with all the projects currently in hand .
but of course there is no one answer to ensuring our supply .
energy efficiency must also be improved .
it is not a quick fix .
i would like to say something more about this .
however , regulations on transparency can be easily circumvented .
this is why we are asking the european commission to abandon its convenient position of idle introspection .
let us not make ourselves vulnerable precisely on this issue .
we all agree on that .
in 2009 , he presented an interesting report , which contained equally interesting conclusions .
so I believe that is the right support to give .
for this reason the second strategic energy review is still very important .
all the points that we put forward in the second energy review are still there .
regarding the point on nuclear energy , we have moved away from this option .
but I doubt that we could go further than that .
there are many instruments , and we will come back to this debate in the future .
thank you very much for this debate .
in writing . bg unfortunately the eu still does not have an effective energy security policy .
developing common rules for the supply and transit of gas 
they have also demonstrated the added value nabucco offers in this respect for the entire european union .
there is only one small problem it is not ours .
it is russia's .
before that , we had the russians taking over the hungarian company mol's interest in nabucco .

explanations of vote
oral explanations of vote
i therefore consider this resolution to be an ideological disgrace .
issues like this , the protection of minors , are for many of our constituents sensitive and ethical issues .
it should be made clear that we cannot overcome this crisis with the measures proposed by the commission alone .
it is a sad fact that the situation in the dairy sector is extremely critical .
a few multinational companies would then dominate the european market .
we in padania drink in memory of the sacrifice made by our producers , which this europe must protect .
this is a disgrace !
we finally must guarantee food sovereignty instead of using the free trade model dictated by the wto .
we were just beginning to get away , and now this house has voted to bring it all back .
this week we are debating the milk quota system in a remastered form .
well , actually I think his dream has gone further and we are seeing the sovietisation of the eu .
it is high time that we introduced a common , eu wide policy in this field .
the european union is dependent on energy imports .
energy consumption is continuing to grow , but the natural resources are limited .
at the moment , our houses are supplied with electrical current without us knowing where it comes from .
written explanations of vote
the serious crisis in the dairy farming sector is putting the very survival of dairy farming at risk .
this report is welcome in this context .
in writing . the fight against terrorism has been high on the agenda of this house .
for this reason , I have voted against the motion for a resolution .
in writing . I and my british conservative colleagues can agree with much of this report .
the motion for a resolution that is being put before us today is truly mind boggling .
those who want to see a better europe should vote against this resolution .
that is the reason for my decision .
and most importantly , to ensure that farmers receive a fair and adequate price for their production .
regrettably , that has not been the case .
i am voting in favour of this resolution , although it does not go far enough .
the milk quota system will still need to continue after 2015 or be replaced with another regulatory mechanism .
that is why we have voted in favour .
it must also encourage better organisation within the sectors .
europe must act now .
the commission has stood by and watched this development for far too long .
the comprehensive agricultural reform that we have adopted is too little .
with this resolution , we are ready to take responsibility for european agriculture .
in writing . de we saved the banks , because we had to .
the army of unemployed is large enough .
allowing farms to go bust would be irresponsible on social , economic and environmental grounds .
the price of their products has fallen rapidly .
that is why I opposed amendment 28 , calling for a freeze in quotas , as too simplistic .
personally , I support the fixing of a minimum price for milk in each country .
however , all these measures have been rejected by the european parliament .
producers have a right to expect parliament to put forward the radical measures they need .
europe is highly dependent on imported energy .
the next item is the commission's statement on the situation in taiwan following the recent typhoon .
on 7 august 2009 taiwan was hit by typhoon morakot , causing major flooding and mudslides .
over 150 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the republic of taiwan was shaken to its foundations on 8 august .
thousands lost their belongings and large areas of land were laid waste .
the damage amounts to more than eur 2.5 billion .
as a token of our solidarity , we europeans wished to support the taiwanese people by providing disaster relief .
it is all the more surprising that the taiwanese embassies were instructed to refuse all foreign aid .
another cause of irritation was the visit to taiwan by the dalai lama over several days in september .
sympathy has long been the message of the much acclaimed speeches and books of the dalai lama .
on this occasion china showed great sensitivity by sending immediate aid to help taiwanese victims .
over 700 people lost their lives and thousands of others have faced major disruption .
happily , after typhoon morakot hit , the commission and the council indicated their willingness to help .
droughts , floods and a rapid increase in extreme weather are gradually increasing due to climate change .
the increase in temperature will considerably increase both the number of typhoons and their intensity .
to date , 120 million people are living in areas affected by typhoons .
between 1980 and 2000 , there were 250 000 typhoon victims .
we must pay by giving financial support to developing countries .
thousands of survivors , if not more , are being put up in military camps for the time being .
now it is time for us to help .
is there an emergency action package or provisions for specific countries ?
the big problem , however , alongside this human catastrophe , is , of course , taiwan's isolation .
all of this is possible and is no obstacle to the one china policy .
taiwan could have been better pre warned if the wmo provided it with timely information .
the aim is to help victims as quickly as possible .
we will continue to do so .
second , we aim to have a comprehensive approach to disaster prevention at eu level .
unfortunately , we were not able to support them enough while they were alive .
anna politkovskaya once said that the west can do so much , but the west does so little .
applause 
author . mr president , allow me to present the chamber with a few facts .
in august , journalist malik akhmedilov was shot dead shortly after leaving his home in dagestan .
human rights violations in russia , and especially in north caucasus , can no longer be ignored .
i am reminded of this story when human rights issues come up .
we are not a diplomatic body we are a political parliamentary body .
there is a saying that goesthe fish stinks from the head down.
these people are being murdered one after the other .
journalists and ngo workers in russia risk their lives every day in the course of their work .
i am concerned that cases like the murder of anna politkovskaya are not investigated .
personally , I also expect human rights issues to be discussed honestly in this house .
the theory that these murders arecoincidentalis not a viable one .
i think that our resolution is well balanced and will help the russians resolve this matter .
we know that the crucial thing that is lacking is a will to do thateverything.
pl we are indeed discussing human rights violations in russia on a day of significant symbolic value .
today's russia is not brave enough to face this horrific truth .
we will remember you all .
these attacks , this onslaught against human rights activists in russia , have had very worrying effects .
the effects of these murders are therefore unpredictable and worrying .
in fact , I am going to the russian embassy tomorrow to get my visa .
let us work together to prevent this from happening to human rights .
what would be the right course of action at a time like this ?
i believe that the break with totalitarianism must be clearly affirmed by every one of us .
the commission knows many of them .
they are highly respected partners in the implementation of human rights projects .
we welcome the more open attitude president medvedev has taken to discussions with the eu on these issues .
the next eu russia summit is another opportunity to continue these discussions .
kazakhstan the case of yevgeny zhovtis
now let us turn to the zhovtis case .
there must be a clear line drawn here .
that being the case , we must first take account of the judgment handed down .
are we seriously suggesting that the sentence is too harsh for somebody who was convicted of manslaughter ?
i hope the house will throw out these resolutions and support the amendments .
in addition , we have heard of several cases of the arbitrary arrest of human rights activists .
that is the solution , not condensing the whole agenda into wednesday .
this is actually a very difficult case .
on the domestic front , it is true that there are also some very positive developments in syria .
however , in terms of political freedom and political plurality , there has been absolutely no progress .
it is not enough just to focus cooperation on improving the economic situation .
only in that way can we make human life worthwhile .
he was also denied the right to leave the country .
with this agreement we will establish a regular dialogue to advise on these issues and achieve better results .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place at the end of the debates .
murder of human rights activists in russia vote

proposal for a decision 
fr mr president , we wish the following phrase to be added to point a 
we thought that the developing countriespoint of view was not reflected within the mandate .
voting time
written explanations of vote 
it is national governments and national taxpayers who pay when banks have to be bailed out .
it follows therefore that banking supervision must be carried out on a national basis and not via the eu .
it is always necessary to go through everything in order .
we shall now go to the main item on this afternoon's agenda .
we hope to see it in just a week or a couple of weeks .
as president of the european council , I am responsible for moving the work of the union forward .
i strongly feel that we have no time to lose .
this is indeed a major achievement .
it was decided democratically .
now what we need is the ratification procedures to be concluded .
of course , we have to see the completion of the process in the czech republic .
it is an important aspect of how the european union does its business .
we need to fix exactly how the new system should work .
finally , I would like to mention the european citizensinitiative .
you can count on the ppe to help work progress quickly .
heckling 
china has 1.3 billion inhabitants . india has 1.1 billion .
these two countries together represent a third of the world's population !
it is clear that , in the 21st century , brazil is the stronger country .
so I am happy .
we need action and we need action urgently .
and we still do not have to wait for several weeks and months .
i agree with you there is no time to waste with this current economic and financial crisis .
what needs to be understood is that referendums in europe only make sense if they have consequences .
so you react depending on your mood .
the second thing which we need to understand clearly is the situation we are in .
i should like to say something now about the process and here I disagree with you , mr reinfeldt .
i have one thing to say to you .
we should all reflect on that .
as a result , this policy has led to an increase in poverty and inequality in europe .
we will not support global military missions in order to assert our own interests .
the whole thing was a travesty !
heckling 
oh , so you respect this vote , do you ?
i suspect that for ireland , their period of independence will be a very brief one in their history .
but it looks like we have got the victory of bureaucracy over national democracy .
mixed reactions 
she did not use the wordonlybut she might easily have done .
it would certainly have resulted in a rejection .
that is good .
once the 27th country has ratified , we will move on .
thank you very much for your comments , and thank you for your support .
regarding some comments , I want to underline certain points , and to reassure some members of parliament .
i am sorry there will not be apresident of europe.
we have to respect the institutions .
if we have lisbon , there will be a president of the european council .
what they want to see is the action to actually begin to deal with these crises .
they want tangible action , not rhetoric .
farming groups were strongly in favour of the treaty and they were very active in this campaign .
this is a major change from the last referendum , and it was clear to be seen .
i would also ask the social democratic members to make that clear .
ga mr president , the people of ireland have spoken .
it was not .
we heard the president tell parliament earlier that thenoside will be respected .
ireland is a democratic state .
that is not democracy .
es mr president , this parliament is the palace of the imagination , the palace of dreams .
de mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the majority is happy and relieved .
we have work to do now and we must not waste any time .
our citizens want a clear and substantive answer .
the treaty of lisbon has been ratified and must enter into force as soon as possible .
this one was therefore by no means the first .
the eurosceptics are indeed poor losers .
is the democracy in europe perfect ?
let us remember how the european union tried to boycott austria when jörg haider came into power .
we cannot pressurise our member states .
ireland experienced european solidarity during the crisis .
european solidarity is a good thing .
the treaty opens up new opportunities .
that will be the litmus test including in the commission hearings .
it is not worthy of the treaty of lisbon , it is not worthy of europe .
what happened in ireland in the referendum was not a victory for democracy .
the eu commission intervened continually interfered in the process .
he is the regulator of transport , supposed to protect consumers and workers .
he is hopelessly compromised by going around with the chief executive of one of the biggest corporations supplying transport .
finally , there is speculation that mr tony blair will be the new president of the eu council .
under no circumstances can he be 
the president cut off the speaker 
mr president , I should like to ask mr higgins what would have enabled him to support the treaty .
there is nothing in the treaty in that sense that a committed socialist could support .
nevertheless , we coped we were independent .
you did not reconsider the matter after a year , or two or even five years .
fi mr president , this is a bad agreement for small countries .
it will weaken ireland's voice , denmark's voice and finland's voice in the council of ministers .
this time the result was 67 % in favour and 33 % against .
what happened and why ?
i maintain that it was fear .
this vote represents the decision of ireland's citizens to continue the process of developing the european union .
this voice will be speaking on behalf of the 27 or more member states .
poland announced that it is going to ratify the treaty immediately .
the debate has echoes of shakespeare to be or not to be for europe .
if we are not there , then we will count for nothing , and will carry no influence .
we have lost years .
europe has fallen behind in international terms .
the president cut off the speaker 
i want britain to enjoy warm and friendly relationships with all our european neighbours .
in my opinion , the repeat referendum in ireland sets a dangerous precedent for the whole european community .
the president cut off the speaker 
now these supporters are happy because this treaty is close to being implemented , and that is fair enough .
i believe that it will result in a centralised superstate .
they cannot get away from this fact .
the president cut off the speaker 
the clear irishyesis good news for ireland and good news for the whole of europe .
in my opinion , prevarication and obstruction bring no dignity to the role and position of the czech president .
i think there were several points that were in the eu's favour this time .
you are not in a strong position if you are alone when storms are raging in the world .
now it is the turn of poland and the czech republic to ratify the treaty .
he has a good relationship with david cameron .
what he has no respect for is the unfair and biased way in which the referendum campaign was conducted .
if it is the first case , then it is a 3 3 score draw .
pl mr president , the irish people have saidyesto the european union .
it should also be remembered that the treaty of lisbon is a compromise on the previous eu draft constitution .
the president cut off the speaker 
therefore , many voters stayed at home .
eu democracy is a one way street .
there was no fair campaign .
the voters were intimidated .
the economic crisis was used as a lever to force people to voteyes.
i would like to say thank you to nigel farage .
that is what is known as unintended consequences , but we are grateful for his intervention .
david cameron's position on the lisbon treaty is quite untenable .
they pretend they have changed but they clearly have not .
may this prove to be the final relinquishment of german and french plans to standardise taxation in the eu .
i have consistently opposed the federalism of the lisbon treaty and the ceding of powers from nation states .
a document harmful to british national interests on 2 october 2009 is equally as harmful on 2 october 20i believe that the treaty of lisbon is a decisive step towards involving national parliaments in european democracy .
we are therefore very pleased with the irish people's decision .
what has changed ?
a lot .
that is what matters .
thenoto start with and then theyes.
i shall repeat what numerous members have said .
the social crisis is europe capable of having an employment policy ?
mt I too , welcome the result of the irish referendum with pleasure .
allow me to make an observation .
our civil rights , as citizens , are to be strengthened by this treaty .
the government also supported the ratification of the treaty , and parliament ratified the treaty .
i believe that this is a good thing , which makes holding the double referendum worthwhile .
the irish people have clearly stated that they believe in the european project .
it will never happen .
we can now finally embark on creating an eu structure for protecting minorities .
adoption of the treaty means a new phase and an opportunity for the eu to make a step forward .
those extremists met their match last friday .
generally , the processes for ratifying european treaties too often look like sagas or pyrrhic victories .
you have often heard about communication deficit .
that would have to be the subject of the referendum and not a treaty that has been ratified .
that would be totally unacceptable .
i think we need to learn something from this , and that is that our citizens need more information .
the eu's own security and development also depend on this .
finally , I would like to say one more thing thank you , ireland .
any delay would create problems for farmers throughout the member states .
i am sure that the treaty will also be ratified by the czech republic .
we all want the institutional impasse we have faced for almost 10 years to finally come to an end .
we can now look forward optimistically to finalising ratification .
our journey thus far has been long and arduous .
what can this be attributed to ?
one reason is that the irish were given a guarantee .
the european union is a union which saysyesrather thanno.
however , there are at least two aspects that require caution .
i only wish that we were smarter than that .
this is not fair and is , in my view , morally wrong .
the irony is that under the lisbon treaty there will be a full time president .
god save our queen !
i am making an sos appeal on behalf of the romanian people .
unfortunately , the hungarian parliament was the first to do this .
if you listen to the people , you ask them why did you voteno?
with this clarification you have a new referendum .
the people answeredyeswith a two thirds majority and with a higher turnout than last time .
we need a few days to grasp and to assess the situation in the constitutional court .
there will be .
i would very much welcome if one of those top jobs could go to a woman .
we need to do that .
thank you very much for an interesting debate , mr president .
could I just start with some facts .
i think it is very important to say this .
and why did they do that ?
and this is what was done .
the concerns of the irish people were listened to and they did it themselves in ireland .
why do we have to explain ?
the debate is closed .
this will give the eu a stronger voice globally , once its institutions have been set up and reformed .
2010 is the year when we hope the treaty will come into force .
the delay has now lasted for over one and a half years .
this is unjustified , reprehensible , and even illegal .
in not fulfilling this obligation , he is breaking the law .
in accordance with the constitution of the republic of poland , there are two possible ways .
the polish people do not want to hinder development of the european union .
president kaczyński does not have the right to interfere with this .
we wait with hope for the final ratifications of the treaty .
contrary to what its opponents say , the treaty does not bring any major revolution .
situation in guinea debate 
the next item is the council statement on the situation in guinea .
president in office of the council . mr president , we move from one item to the next .
during the violent repression , several opposition leaders were wounded and temporarily arrested .
we will have to insist on the liberation of the arrested prisoners and a thorough investigation of the events .
we have not been alone .
our international partners have acted in line with us .
captain camara's decision not to run could allow calm to return .
we discuss the effectiveness of development cooperation fairly often .
yesterday , mr camara accused france of humiliating africans by breaking off relations with guinea .
you also told us that all aid had been frozen , except for humanitarian and food aid .
the organisations on the ground are warning us of the risk of ethnic conflict .
it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mrs malmström described the situation in guinea perfectly .
it reflects the commission's evaluation of the previous agreement .
we have no idea where the money from these fisheries agreements will end up .
we have the international contact group .
we are also open to answering other questions and to discuss sanctions .
we are also discussing this with the commission , and I am sorry they are not here right now .
thank you very much , mrs malmström .
one minute speeches on matters of political importance
the next item is the one minute speeches on matters of political importance .
however , gas is not the only energy resource available to european states .
changes are being forced on polish surnames , so that they look like lithuanian ones .
unfortunately , these declarations are contradicted by reality on a daily basis .
the situation in northern portugal is an illustration of this .
i would like your constituencies to ask you to do that , too .
incidentally , the situation is the same if I try to speak in english .
welcome to absurdistan !
however , you did not utilise this opportunity .
all I can say to that is that this is not what I call democracy .
that is what we stand for and that is what we are fighting for .
not even those who committed war crimes during the balkan war have been given such stiff sentences .
during the same period , around 300 hungarians were beaten in serbia without any legal repercussions .
even more than that , it is their future that is at stake here .
this is extremely urgent .
finally , I come to this high level group , this think tank that was launched the day before yesterday .
it is also important to point out that from childhood , mr ivanilovas has suffered from bronchial asthma .
this is the instruction concerning the protection of personal data in the activity of the catholic church in poland .
i deeply regret the need to raise this matter in this chamber .
however , hyperbole can turn to insanity .
nevertheless , we should be compassionate .
hu ladies and gentlemen , a great deal has already been said today about minority issues .
the other lesson to be learnt is that the minorities were involved in drafting this law .
hu there has been much talk earlier about minorities .
political and economic decision makers have a responsibility to take heed of people with disabilities .
the treaty now obliges the european institutions to be more democratic and more responsive to individual european people .
on this point , I wish to mention a specific example from romania .
that is why I urge the commission to review the rules on state aid support .
parliament should adopt , for instance , a minority framework law that guarantees minoritiesrights .
minorities are entitled to feel safe .

prevention and settlement of conflicts of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings debate 
the commission welcomes the report and supports some of the proposed amendments .
eurojust has already proved in the years since its establishment that it deserves our trust .
i will finish by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for the way they worked on this report .
the ppe position differs from that of the rapporteur on two matters .
if there is a possibility of the two parties reaching consensus , why introduce another body and procedure ?
we cannot support a european penal code or a european code of criminal procedure .
our duty is therefore to ensure that these procedural guarantees are abided by in all member states .
i believe that mrs macovei is right .
ro I wish to congratulate the rapporteur and the co rapporteur for the fine job they have done .
there is no provision intended to deal with negative conflicts of jurisdiction .
the basic principle of this directive is to initiate direct communication between the relevant authorities in the member states .
i would like to thank you once more for holding this debate .
the debate is closed .
rules governing the exchange of information between the authorities of the member states conducting such criminal proceedings 
author . madam president , I would like to thank commissioner tajani for being with us this evening .
it is a loophole which parliament , with the assistance of the commission , is seeking to close .
the commission has already started work to come up with a practical response to these issues .
you intend to present a proposal over the next year .
madam president , thank you , commissioner , for your response .
indeed , mr simpson has already presented it to us .
this gap relates to the insolvency of airlines , as has already been discussed .
in this regard , I am pleased to hear you say that you are working on a solution .
i am looking forward to the discussion in committee , which may perhaps even take place this year .
a fair market will not only protect passengers from unfair practices , it will protect the competitors , too .
madam president , over the last nine years , nearly 80 airlines have gone bankrupt in the european union .
the problem has not been restricted to low cost carriers , although these have accounted for most of the failures .
it is a matter of capital adequacy and insurance for return journeys .
companies are going bankrupt in the economic recession and airline companies are no exception .
therefore , it was with amazement that I listened to the explanations of the skyeurope spokesman .
i stress the wordinconvenience.
skyeurope was a listed company , and so we had more information about it .
in the case of other cut price airlines , this is not always so .
yes , solidarity , an idea which is , to me , as a pole , especially dear .
any costs involved would be settled between the airlines concerned .
i would like to ask the commissioner for a reply .
its services were used by a wide range of customers .
passengers must therefore make their claims in bankruptcy proceedings .
the chances of getting money back in this way are negligible .
it is therefore time to do something about this .
madam president , passengerscompensation in the case of airline bankruptcies is not only a question of money .
for example , in 2004 , the polish airline air polonia went bankrupt .
the vote on any motions for resolutions will take place during the next part session .
we would regularly see on television pictures of families stranded abroad .
we must think about tightening the rules on setting up companies .
the deadline was five years , but there is no report from the european commission .
in 2001 , council regulation no 2157 / 2001 on the statute for a european company was adopted .
the regulation came into force in 200agenda for next sitting see minutes
i mean radio spectrum policy .
we had an example of this as recently as yesterday in italy .
exclamation by mr schulz 
interruption by mr schulz 
we know who the troublemakers are .
it does not bother me .
i am not annoyed . mr president .
are the italian courts prevented from enforcing the law ?
the answer to all of these questions is clearly no .
to claim the opposite is to ignore the reality of matters no one is fooled by that .
i did not have this opportunity in the time that was allocated to me .
the president asked the members to allow the speaker to continue 
it is my decision .
applause 
i am entitled to do this , and we must move on with our discussion .
that cannot be true .
this is one of the copenhagen criteria . everybody has to stick to the copenhagen criteria .
applause 
this heated debate shows that something is going on .
the way things are going in italy makes that country very vulnerable in its democracy .
perhaps there have been similar situations in other countries .
similar situations have occurred in other countries .
if there is a problem , then at such a time we should always talk about it .
almost 10 years later , we are paying the price . this is a highly dangerous development .
where is this directive ?
mrs reding , what are you afraid of ?
what forces are at work here ?
it is almost exclusively the governing political parties .
in fact , in 2004 , a debate was held in this house on freedom of information in italy .
there was a centre right government , and there was a prime minister silvio berlusconi .
following the victory of the left in 2006 , the problem miraculously disappeared .
such sponsors account for up to 68 % of these actions .
simply lost .
the president cut off the speaker 
our group feels that media pluralism is not just an italian issue .
i would point out that only in china do such things happen .
i would have nothing against a european discussion on that issue here as well .
that is my opinion .
he is probably the very last person who should be speaking about this .
the largest source of income for the spd today is its media interests .
it is true , there are no laws against freedom of the press as yet .
this is the situation in which we therefore find ourselves .
you champions of freedom of the press against censorship !
he had to go on a hunger strike what fine freedom fighters !
what freedom does the italian press federation grant to the minority ?
what fine freedom fighters !
go to tehran , go to tehran , cowards , cowards , cowards , cowards !
long live freedom , long live our free and democratic country .
not once in our speeches have we mentioned the italian prime minister .
that is not the problem , however .
we are all aware of the italian prime minister's colourful character .
however , this is not the issue here .
the answer to that is clear .
commissioner reding very strangely said that we should not use the eu institutions to solve national problems .
that legal basis exists and must be complemented by legislation on media diversity and pluralism .
while listening to the debate , two questions occurred to me .
is it as important a fundamental right as freedom of speech ?
it certainly is .
ro freedom of the press is never given adequate protection against abuse .
we have heard the information supplied by our fellow members .
freedom of the press in italy has , in the berlusconi government , the most generous of backers .
over the last three years , 200 journalists have been threatened on account of what they have written .
today , parliament has a unique opportunity to bring out and reveal our most positive attributes .
italy's concerns are also our own .
for the benefit of the non italian members , I will take the liberty of doing a press review .
then there is the refoundation party , which has its own newspaper , liberazione .
lastly , there is the political subject of this debate il fatto quotidiano .
it refers to mr di pietro's party , which is the driving force behind this debate today .
one of these is the united kingdom .
bg thank you , madam president .
the president again requested silence 
they will be the basis for our future work .
this is a fundamental question that has to be discussed in depth .
all this would need to be clarified before we could start a legislative process .
i think , in the end , that is what the parliament wants .
applause 
we german social democrats are proud of our media interests !
half an hour later , the ambulance arrived to treat mrs niebler .
one's safety is not guaranteed in this city .
. nor are responses from the authorities .

the vote will take place during the second october part session .

voting time
the next item is the vote .
what I do strongly oppose , however , is the federalist tone of various amendments .
this is not going to be easy , but I believe that we are moving in the right direction .
so the g20 leaders get together and they saywhat is the solution ?
and now we want to reform the entire financial system .
the implementation of the millennium goals is now at serious risk .
i see this report as a seed at least .
nl madam president , the hypocrisy and inconsistency of this house continue to amaze me .
however , we also need to work on underdevelopment as a form of prevention .
i am therefore in agreement that the mobilisation of the esf is justified and have voted in favour .
technical reasons cannot be used to postpone voting on reports which have serious repercussions for european citizens .
in writing . I voted in favour of amendment this could well be the highest amount ever granted to date by this fund .
with this vote , parliament is thus showing full solidarity and unity with the affected populations .
in writing . I welcome the positive vote releasing funding for the abruzzo earthquake victims .
improving judicial cooperation in criminal proceedings between authorities which have parallel competences is a particularly important measure .
hence , I have voted in the affirmative .
we voted against this report because of the strengthening of the role of eurojust that it aims to establish .
on the one hand , the economic crisis and its social consequences require urgent measures to restore job creating growth .
the european union needs stricter financial market supervision , for which one institution would be accountable g20 .
nonetheless , they have not signed the joint resolution so that they can make a scene in plenary .
in writing . I voted in favour of the resolution on the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
together with the other countries of europe , we will be able to overcome the challenges we currently face .
furthermore , the amendment suggests that a unilateral european form of such a tax should be considered .
in writing . I abstained from the vote on amendment 8 on a financial transaction tax .
there is no penetration through to real , needed reforms .
it is for that reason that I have abstained from voting .
it is therefore even more important to adopt appropriate rules for the markets quickly .
these are current global issues , universally considered vital for the european growth process .
we think that a more detailed discussion of how international financial transactions should be handled is needed .
this has a massive impact on their already weak economies and will put millions more people out of work .
we europeans must therefore support these countries in building up their economies .
we think that a more detailed discussion of how international financial transactions should be handled is needed .
the crisis may also be a new opportunity .
providing aid to developing countries is one duty that the european union must not abandon .
the new , sound workings of international finance will have to be based on fairness .
that concludes the explanations of vote .

fr mr president , my speech relates , in fact , to monday's agenda .
i note that these issues have disappeared from the debate and I find that deeply regrettable .
had there been a request , we could have considered this matter in a different way .
there is no discussion on the agenda because of the absence of any kind of motion on this matter .
tuesday 
no amendments have been proposed .
wednesday 
not every issue in europe is an issue for europe .
the italian parliament has just proven that it is independent .
mr president , this is actually something of a humiliating spectacle .
we want to say something in general about freedom of opinion in europe .
we should not try and do everything .
thank you for your attention .
30 % of police officers , 30 % of schoolteachers and 30 % of doctors have lost their jobs .
all this has led to a social explosion .
we must really care for the food security of our continent .
thank you .
the money is largely directed towards developing sustainable economic growth and creating jobs .
together , they form an unpleasant cocktail of old soviet design and american engineering .
the parties to the proceedings have no possibility of obtaining judicial review of the final decision .
i should like to take this opportunity to call on the community to firmly oppose this construction project .
a large number of meps , from four different groups , have signed an appeal along these lines .
these tv repeaters allow the reception of catalan television in the valencia region .
one small example is austria , where the income divide is about 28 % .
this means that repression is once again intensifying in this former spanish colony .
frontex is currently facing a number of problems .
it would fully accord with the principles of intermodality and would have a balanced influence on the natural environment .
in both cases , the commission cannot abandon its producers and we cannot allow that to happen .
since then , his detention period has been repeatedly extended by the israeli army .
a military judge is due to rule on his detention on tuesday 20 october i.e. tomorrow .
this can then serve as an example for the entire area to the east of the eu .
the only ones still making their minds up are president václav klaus and the czech constitutional court .
i must express our concern publicly and say that we will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed .
this was presumably under the political order of the party which has succeeded the communist dictatorship .
it took 50 years after 1956 for hungarian blood to be shed again on the streets of budapest .
experience has taught us that in situations like these , we should not remain silent .
pt regional differences remain a challenge in the context of an enlarged european union .
el mr president , I should like to speak about accidents at work in greece and europe .
the statistics for my country , greece , are tragic .
and it is strange , I have finished , mr president .
the president cut off the speaker 
still some europeans contest the project , ignoring its new orientation .
sk I would like to warn you that representatives of hungary are attempting to provoke slovakia .
on 21 august 20 years ago , a soviet and hungarian army invaded the former czechoslovakia .
today , he is protesting that he was denied entry into slovakia .
i would like to tell you that there is no legal basis for an eu policy on sport .
nevertheless , I am disappointed with the proposals put forward by the european commission .
indeed , the only new thing , which I applaud , is the possibility of carrying out unannounced visits .
however , it would also be possible to apply the codecision procedure for the draft regulation .
political will is the only deciding factor between the two possibilities .
the citizens must have access to the results of these evaluations .
so that is the first response .
when it comes to external borders , trust is placed in a country and trust is gained in return .
restricting the role of an institution like the european parliament is wrong .
i propose to you that we support the draft resolution .
the commission , when it works at its best , is the one to do it .
nevertheless , we parliamentarians have a number of concerns .
i shall not remind you about the role of the european parliament as an elected institution .
we have heard already that , under the lisbon treaty , the codecision procedure will be the only option .
we fully support the rapporteur and we also support his proposal .
i cannot , however , support the conclusions of the rapporteur , our fellow member , carlos coelho .
de mr president , we need a democratic revolution .
the aim of this mandate is to make the schengen evaluation mechanism more efficient .
all the same , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report .
over the centuries , people's movement has been severely curtailed in europe .
suspicion of our fellow men has dominated relations between the countries of europe .
it is easy to forget the arduous road to get to that point .
i urge the commission to come up with a new and better proposal as quickly as possible .
the commission is right to worry .
so here we are , wasting our time , thank you very , very much .
the incorporation of the nine new member states was possible only under exceptional conditions , of course .
however , we are still miles away from that .
after all , it was not created for the politicians or for international organisations , but for particular states .
these measures form the basis of the mutual confidence that is crucial to good cooperation in the schengen area .
it is something I would support entry into .
schengen has worked extremely well and it is visible for all to see .
madam president , we have survived the cold snap here , in this chamber .
our aim is not to exclude parliament , as I heard someone say .
this was no surprise to me .
in the first place , there can be no breach in consistency .
all parties must be involved .
the joint debate is closed .
schengen cooperation can take many different forms .
there you have it I am grateful to parliament and to mr busuttil for his cooperation .
it reinforces this initiative , which will thus make travelling easier for our fellow citizens .
we in the gue / ngl group are in favour of abolishing all short stay visas .
we do have one small point one small technical point to make however , commissioner .
firstly , with this decision , which facilitates movement , we are disproving the idea of a fortress europe .
either the whole european area is accepted or it is not .
this goes for my colleagues as well as for the vice president of the european commission , jacques barrot .
brazil , with whom negotiations have recently taken place , is another case in point .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
progress of sis ii and vis debate 
the next item is the commission statement on the progress of sis ii and vis .
for the first milestone , there is an extra cost of eur 1 026 000 .
i do not believe , but I may be proved wrong , that there is a design problem .
the tests should be concluded on 11 november .
there is real cause for concern there is no point in hiding it .
i think you will understand why we tabled a joint resolution , because there is a genuine concern here .
in our resolution , we do not want to be seen to be making unreasonable demands .
could you tell us what those penalties are ?
what are the estimated extra costs envisaged ?
we can , I guess , expect some further slippage .
in answers to me , the government has said that it is not worried about any implications for security .
we also regret that more and more authorities have access to these systems .
i would also like to ask what action has been taken against contractors to secure some damages .
it is a pragmatic approach , even if we are strongly criticised for it .
clearly , it is easier to exercise parliamentary scrutiny of the commission than of the council .
there have been many problems and delays .
in his political life , he has always shown himself to be competent , serious and a true pro european .
why do we need sis ii ?
this raises a number of questions .
we are now talking about it being developed perhaps over 10 years .
this , therefore , raises several questions .
is the european commission ready to implement an alternative plan ?
will this equipment be used in the alternative plan ?
mrs ždanoka talked to me about biometric data and controlling access to the system .
we reached an overall agreement at the end of july .
i wish to say that parliament is welcome to help us spur on the co contractor .
thank you for your reply , commissioner .
i have received three motions for resolutions to wind up this debate .

this gesture was one of great attentiveness which we appreciated .
it failed to react in any way for months as the crisis went on .
the commission has also failed to say how it intends to reinforce the producer organisations going forwards .
we , parliament , have long been fighting for more rights particularly in the field of agriculture .
we must not , however , give up any responsibility .
we must provide the dairy farmers with serious and long lasting help .
i can partially agree with what the previous speaker said .
climate change and developing countries in the framework of the un conference on climate change in copenhagen debate 
mr president , we are at a decisive point in time .
negotiations are moving too slowly , however .
a number of key issues have not yet been resolved .
let me make one thing clear that is not what the eu is here to do .
we want the eu to show leadership by expressing a clear , unequivocal political will .
this means planning low carbon growth , integrating climate measures and adapting national development strategies .
the european council has concluded that climate change is undermining efforts to combat poverty and achieve sustainable development .
we will particularly highlight development issues within the context of the ongoing negotiations .
adaptation measures are required in this regard .
the council is aware of the scale of the financing required .
it is not a matter of choosing one or the other both are essential .
expectations are very high .
it is now the time for putting offers on the table .
finally , a word on the delivery channels for climate funding .
i have been involved with this since the climate conference in rio in 199the mood before these conferences is always the same , but there are also opportunities .
let us develop criteria for how the money is used .
enough has been said about the crisis .
mr president , climate change is responsible for more than 300 000 deaths each year .
the union cannot reasonably pledge less than eur 35 billion in public finances .
mr president , mr carlgren , commissioner , I would like to begin by responding to the previous speech .
our scientific approach should not be changed .
we have no influence on what the sun does .
as we all know , it determines a great deal of the climate on our planet .
these two themes are intimately linked .
man made global warming is an unproven theory based on manipulative statistics .
the eu has a vital responsibility .
ultimately , this is a matter of solidarity .
consequently , both oda resources and new funding will be required .
as mr florenz says , we need to cooperate with major nations such as the us .
this is not simply a competition .
yet the united states and the emerging economies , too , must put their hands in their pockets .
i see positive incentives for green investments and innovations by enterprises as more promising than a new european tax .
we have to resolve two specific issues if we are to prove the pessimists wrong .
i would like to ask mr carlgren whether he has the council's backing for his high ambitions .
the gamble has not yet paid off , as the presidency has just pointed out .
the european union must remain credible when it comes to the impact of climate change on developing countries .
skimping on that objective is out of the question .
once again , this is a time for eu leadership .
it is obvious that the eur 2 15 billion proposed by the commission cannot be enough .
the bali action plan put that well .
they , too , must face up to their responsibilities .
forests , including the tropical rainforests , counteract a substantial proportion of co2 emissions .
we cannot transform the legitimate battle to protect the environment into a war between poor peoples .
there were many people who optimistically expected that barack obama would bring about major changes and travel to copenhagen .
without success .
this is , indeed , a key matter .
in copenhagen this december , the world faces the historic task of giving substance to those words .
meanwhile , the oil disappears unhindered from these developing countries , often without fair payment reaching their treasuries .
in the future , climate change will cost developing countries more than eur 100 billion per year .
of course , there are climate measures that can also stimulate the development of poor countries .
planting trees helps to combat desertification .
we must break through this logic in copenhagen by introducing new financing mechanisms .
this fund must be introduced , therefore , for the eu and for the world .
inaction is a crime against humanity .
this is an emergency , but the negotiations are at a virtual standstill .
however , it is europe that holds the key to copenhagen .
let us be clear we really have no choice .
at present , fossil fuels provide for almost 85 % of the world's energy needs .
a pollutant !
isn't this all about politics and big business ?
one hypothesis is that the global temperature will continue to rise .
we heard something about polling .
in fact , only 10 % of europeans said it was not a serious issue at all .
about three years ago , fiona hall and I went to northern kenya .
why ?
you could say that agriculture is the big villain in this context .
in developing countries , the land is drying out and diseases are spreading .
so I wonder will you offer eur 35 40 billion a year in new aid for climate measures ?
will you accept compulsory licensing of important green technology to the poorest countries ?
going beyond a declaration of intent shows that we are decided and serious about fundamental issues such as financing .
this is the fairer option .
applause 
it makes no difference to the earth's atmosphere where the co2 comes from .
only new technology can enable us to maintain our way of life .
the climate is a global problem , but has not been tackled by sharing the best available technology .
this was a complete failure under kyoto , and so let us learn the lessons .
particularly enterprises at the forefront of such development must be encouraged and rewarded accordingly .
i would welcome mr carlgren's comments on this .
all countries must play their part in terms of achieving targets and sustainable development .
the developing world must be supported and encouraged , but the targets set for these nations must be realistic .
i am , though , glowing hot in my opposition to the concept of man made climate change .
it is a vital and irreplaceable food for plant life .
a shortage of this gas will be far more serious than a surplus .
developed countries are not going to do it and developing countries are even less likely to do so .
we know about the great difficulties that will result if we do not accept our international responsibilities .
have you ever played russian roulette ?
of course not , because you have one chance in six of being killed or injured .
talk of 2020 or 2050 is not good enough .
let me just say this there is talk of plants and co2 there is deforestation and desertification .
this means that in some places there is no water .
climate change kills .
that is eur 30 billion per annum .
we are a month and a half away from copenhagen , just a few weeks away .
this was the message from various leaders at the recent united nations meeting .
this was the message from the president of the spanish government .
the council and the commission must do more in this connection .
other regions in the world , too , must do more .
shipping is the most efficient and environmentally friendly mode of transport , while aviation is more or less the worst .
let us remember that we must speak with one voice if we are to maintain our credibility .
copenhagen must also enable developing countries to move in the direction of low carbon models .
i heard it said just now that this is not enough , but it is already a good start .
we have a responsibility , but we also have duties towards these countries .
the european union will be judged on this contribution and on this commitment .
this will be the only way of making ourselves heard and of ensuring that our virtuous commitment has meaning .
there is something else which we must not forget , especially here in the european union .
this agreement should be based on the principle of shared yet differentiated responsibility .
all developing countries , with the exception of the least developed , should adopt national low carbon development strategies .
firstly , our efforts with regard to climate so far have brought us no benefits .
secondly , it has to be said that we know less than we thought we did some time ago .
now it has stopped increasing , and global cooling is predicted to continue over the years to come .
the world can no longer afford a poor agreement on climate .
however , we cannot limit ourselves to this .
therefore , parliament , in following the lead of certain national political leaders , is assuming its responsibilities .
the solutions that we come up with together must help to solve all three of these crises .
people all over the world expect the copenhagen conference to come up with vigorous measures .
this agricultural area covered by forest vegetation amounts to double the area of the amazon rainforest .
i agree with mr carlgren .
however , there is a single factor that affects all this climate change .
i would have liked minister carlgren to have prioritised things more .
however , let us accept for the moment that man made emissions are a bad thing for various reasons .
nor must we forget that climate change will require the contribution of science , technology and economics .
so climate change and global poverty will have to be tackled hand in hand .
there has been mention of the need to globally achieve low carbon development I agree with that .
then we will speak about the united states we will also speak about the bric countries .
the debate is closed .
the us seems unable to pass legislation to curb its excessive co2 emissions .
europeans have an historic responsibility to clean up the climate mess we helped create .
some say we cannot afford such new financing .
i strongly support the european union in having to maintain its leading position in the battle against climate change .
it must not slip to number two as a result of the current economic difficulties .
the european union plays an important role in , and assumes a commitment to , funding the climate programme .
the european decisions made recently facilitate this .
last but not least , the eu must adopt a uniform position for maintaining its leading role in negotiations .
when making decisions , we should also think of the citizens .
in the light of these studies , the eu's climate targets cannot be called too ambitious .
everyone knows how serious the problem is .
the only problem is that we have no time left .
however , it is not enough to cut greenhouse gas emissions to alleviate the impact of climate change .
additional action is required to alleviate this problem in the short term .
the eu is a world leader in the fight against climate change .
when we provide assistance , we must be responsible to a high degree for its consequences .
the links between developing countries and the developed world are complex .
the greatest proportion of the resources should be targeted on supporting education and the information society .
even in the european parliament , not everyone is convinced that climate change is a real threat .

written explanations of vote
i voted in favour of this report .
currently , there is no coordinated renewable energy strategy on both a european and world scale .
in writing . irena was officially established on 26 january 200the statute of this organisation has been concluded .
this vote refers to certain council acts in the field of the common agricultural policy .
acts such as these serve simply to confuse , without serving any real purpose .
during the process of european integration , many acts were passed in the european parliament and the council .
the commission lately declared 250 agricultural laws obsolete .
in writing . the government of malta should follow similar initiatives for the island of gozo .
the smaller islands of the maltese archipelago are particularly vulnerable .
i am in favour of such extension and have therefore voted in favour of this report .
in writing . this consists of a simple codification of texts without any change to their substance .
in practice , of course , this situation is shamelessly exploited .
in writing . this is a codification without any substantial changes and therefore I have voted in favour .

question hour with the president of the commission
i am very pleased to find this procedure now in the european parliament .
the process of ratification is still ongoing in the czech republic .
it was downgraded by some member states .
president of the commission . I have always supported my commissioners , including neelie kroes .
chairman of the alde group . nl I have no further questions .
mr verhofstadt , let us be clear .
but the reality is that others have to match our level of ambition .
it is also the way to protect small and medium sized companies with regard to the big monopolies or oligopolies .
co chairman of the efd group . mr barroso , it is very good to see you here .
consequences of the financial crisis on employment and social cohesion
in fact , it was also a cornerstone of your crisis and recovery plan .
we are linking those two issues .
certainly this is a matter that we should also consider for the next financial perspectives .
colleagues , could I ask you not to ask supplementary questions .
our objective is to strengthen social cohesion .
you need to tell the council that we cannot go on like this .
that is why we are promoting the common active inclusion principles as community policy .
that represents about eur 3 500 billion more !
exceptional measures were needed for what was an unprecedented situation .
how can we link these strategies that are available to us ?
how can we divide up the portfolios so as to take account of the lessons learnt from this crisis ?
with regard to the tools , I will cite just one example .
i therefore sent this letter only today .
i already announced the main innovations during my debate with you .
president of the commission . I would like to thank graham watson for this very important question .
we have to understand that the model of the future will not be like the model of the past .
that is where we can create new products , new markets .
i think innovation will be key for the development of the european economy in the future .
we have community level instruments , but there are some instruments that are national level instruments .
i do not think that shutting off europe is the solution for portugal or any other european country .
i think that it is in europe's best interests to maintain open global markets .
mr barroso , the financial crisis in the uk is very serious .
i have been told it is only 79 % accurate .
if there are problems in the implementation , we are ready to look at it .
let us see how it works in practice .
do you think , mr president , that this measure to help them is sufficient ?
hungary is in a particularly difficult position as it only has foreign commercial banks .
we have to do more for smes I think it is a priority .
we have approved the small business act that is good .
so I think smes should remain a priority of our action for sustainability , including sustainable employment .
thankfully , that day is now over so I will go on to my question .
this is , after all , an interactive work with the member states too .
that concludes the item .
section I european parliament
section ii council
section ix european data protection supervisor
is it able to protect the eu's borders ?
there are no major differences dividing political groups .
however , there is a serious difference of opinion between the council and parliament .
earlier , when we were thinking about 2010 , it was with a seven year budget in mind .
annual budgets also feature commitments , many of which remain unfulfilled .
if we have made mistakes , we do not want to prevent the programmes from being implemented .
we must also look more closely in the future at the extent to which our objectives have been achieved .
the european court of auditors recently published a survey on the successes and struggles of the dairy sector .
it is only natural that each political group will also promote their views and seek to raise their profile .
thank you for your respectful attention .
every institution and every unit of every institution must make every effort to achieve savings .
there have always been reserves here and many of them have even increased over recent years .
we have a common pot of funding .
buildings were not always purchased in the right place , at the right time or for the minimum cost .
europe is going through its worst economic crisis since the second world war .
it wants financing for administration !
the situation in palestine is , unfortunately , one of the best examples of this .
if our gnp goes down a percentage , our contribution to these people also goes down .
i will present three of them to you in one minute .
there are two things that we must impress on the commission .
in practice , however , their idea of prioritising is to implement cuts of 7 % .
above all , we demand that vigorous efforts be made in respect of research and innovation .
stockpiling and export refunds , however , were even being labelled as yesterday's tools two years ago .
the first is the question of implementing supervision structures at european level .
what the european union does , and why , should be fully known to the citizens .
however , I should like to issue a warning .
the budget must have the ability to be tangible and dynamic , to listen and to respond .
the commitments represent serious political intentions , but also real , concrete actions .
other matters also deserve special attention .
we support the draft budget put forward by mr surján .
i would also like to thank mr maňka for his work on the budget for other institutions .
now we may finally see it laid on the table .
that also means that we need to invest more money in research and development .
we need to change our agricultural policy , which must become more environmental in nature .
we greens take the view that the dairy farmers must be helped at this point .
we also want to redistribute money .
we want an ecological energy policy , we want broadband in rural areas and we want pan european electricity networks .
that is what we expect from the negotiations over the coming weeks .
so the three points I would like to make in the debate today are as follows .
here , however , we will be looking at the budget .
what we need is another policy for rural areas .
this is ridiculous and incomprehensible .
i hope that on thursday , we will at least have the decency to review this state of affairs .
is this the way this parliament wants to bring the budget closer to the citizens ?
europe was a guarantee for peace and prosperity for a long time .
let us work together to make sure that it continues to be just that .
that is not something we can ignore .
one of the results of the crisis is unemployment .
instead , large sums are repaid to the member states as rebates .
secondly , this year , the arguments for this are even stronger than usual .
it is a pity that the minister had to leave as I had a question for him .
there will be no net contribution to the baltic sea strategy .
europe's left instead demands that the european union implement a consistent peace policy .
the dutch public the class dunce is of course the largest net contributor once again .
perhaps we will be happier in the committee on budgets when the lisbon treaty enters into force .
however , the new powers will also mean new responsibilities .
firstly , the funding of the european economic recovery plan .
this is a disgrace .
the second matter is the dairy fund .
the council and the commission have just accepted eur 280 million .
we played our part in attaining that .
i have just heard mr van der stoep , another dutch representative , say he rejects these resources .
we have also increased the allocation for the programme of research for small and medium sized businesses .
for my part , I want to mention just one special matter .
the reason for this passivity is the administration and control system , which needs simplifying urgently .
i think members should resist all this .
this way of strengthening the economy strengthens the economies of countries in the far east .
this has evoked remarks and reservations from some politicians .
this is because the army also generates new technologies , and can create new , modern jobs .
i would therefore ask for more information on the subject .
perhaps you would like to get your answers to the members in question in writing .
i also entirely agree that everything he considers important parliament also considers important , such as education and research .
however , I must mention a few ideas expressed during the debate which I do not agree with .
this is spurious and misleading , and it will ruin our whole common future .
the political message is about how this parliament would like to lead the european union to greener pastures .
my time has run out .
the committee on budgets has also worked constructively with other institutions in the past .
an increase in the rate of community cofinancing in the structural and cohesion funds .
a development programme for portuguese industry 
a programme for supporting small scale , artisanal coastal fisheries 
an increase in funding for the life + programme .
preparing a budget is never an easy process , even less so during an economic crisis .
the european parliament has undoubtedly a crucial role to play in this debate .
the eu budget needs to make full use of the financial margins to respond to the economic crisis .
this clearly shows us that human rights cannot be divorced from democracy .
the entire development policy and the common foreign and security policy cover this whole spectrum .
the efforts made up to that point had been largely inadequate .
the israeli palestinian conflict is a striking example of this .
its conclusions are fair and balanced , and universal support for them would represent a step towards peace .
the persistent vagueness concerning the place accorded to human rights in our policies is reprehensible and counterproductive .
consequently , there can be no development without peace .
both require full respect for human rights .
how can we do this ?
well , by identifying specific ways of using the eu's instruments more effectively within a uniform framework .
that is why it is becoming a stable environment for democracy .
however , talking about human rights and democracy with our partner countries can never embody conditionality .
where are we now ?
the relevant working groups have initiated discussions on proposals for the council's conclusions , based on various contributions .
those responsible for development and human rights issues are working together more closely .
the eu's support for election processes around the world is important .
we share the concern that parliament sometimes feels as regards the need togo beyond the elections.
the government then risks losing both legitimacy and political support .
i would like to thank the members of the european parliament for pushing this issue .
europe must therefore assume its role as a soft power .
the ngos can submit projects to it without the support of their government , and that is important .
no .
there is therefore a close relationship between freedom , democracy and human rights .
the partnerships between the european union and third countries cannot ignore this fact .
member states often have very conflicting and differing aspirations .
how can we rid ourselves of these double standards ?
today , during a period of economic crisis , it is particularly important that this dimension is not overlooked .
the eastern partnership is an important instrument for strengthening democracy among our immediate neighbours .
mrs hautala brought up the issue of uzbekistan .
the human rights situation there is far from satisfactory .
as mrs hautala is aware , extending sanctions requires unanimity in the council .
subject women's participation in positions of responsibility in the job market
in the private sector , men account for nine out of ten directors of top european companies .
during 2010 the commission will arrange information activities and the sharing of proven approaches .
the question of quotas for women on the boards of large companies is under discussion .
the issue of gender equality should be a central element in the new strategy .
thank you for the supplementary question .
i chose this career but I have somebody who has chosen to be at home .
part two
the total cost of this project is eur 791 000 .
could you also support nurseries ?
what matters is the quality of the project submitted by the various representatives .
the subject of universities in poland and germany has already been mentioned earlier .
the following is an overview of four of the matters concerned .
olaf is following closely the judicial proceedings in that country .
it involves public procurement procedures .
this ruling , inter alia , sentenced several persons to terms of imprisonment , and imposed fines for forgery .
this is the general picture .
subject cigarette smuggling and revenue
olaf has a clear strategy .
these cigarettes are contributing to that problem but not making any contribution to the cost of treating it .
nowadays , 19 % of young people in europe drop out of school .
so far , only five member states have invested more than 2 % of gdp in research and innovation .
what measures does the commission envisage adopting with this in mind ?
the answer is very clear that people then moved about much more and had much more physical activity .
in this respect , the european union is still waiting for real competences in sport .
you said in your response to mr aylward that volunteering brings clear economic value .
subject white paper on sport
as you probably know , this high level group meets at least three times a year .
in the area of sport , the white paper remains the single most important reference point .
mr president , I would like to thank the commissioner for his response .
the rights of minorities are being flagrantly violated in the eu .
here is an example from italy .
sl thank you for your answer , commissioner .
this is a very specific problem and one that concerns people's lives .
the possibility already exists today for member states to buy up quotas .
the programme would have to be obligatory for it to have any impact at all .
yet I see no majority for that in this parliament or in the council .
if it proves its worth , we will then agree to an extension .
i know that you do not have any more money available to you .
i think that is the challenge .
however , I remain unconvinced by the buy out scheme .
we must do this to protect the industry .
i would add that , with your plan , we will have a milk shortage in the future .
however , I have three questions to ask .
have we learnt any lesson from it ?
looking at the future , what can you promise farmers ?
how and when will this injustice and inequity be eliminated ?
however , such crises recur again and again .
perhaps it will not be dairy next time .
i have more questions for the commissioner .
i stand by that view .
it has my support , although I prefer that we limit this concession until 2013 at the latest .
pl mr president , I hope that the milk producers now have the worst behind them .
i firmly believe this .
we must also recognise , though , that it is the end of the financial year .
de mr president , commissioner , I very much welcome your motion .
we should acknowledge that in this house and push to ensure that they are passed on to farmers .
let us look at the lessons .
production will therefore have to be concentrated still further and milk producers in the most difficult areas forced out .
this is the wrong approach .
for example , some states cannot even produce enough to cover their own consumption .
the president cut off the speaker 
in fact , the farmers want the money to be used for support mechanisms .
is now the time for restrictions on the production of milk or cereals ?
ok , you have chosen your path and followed it consistently .
this was one part of the discussion .
it will be discussed , as you probably know , in the management committee .
i think it would disqualify dairy farmers but of course I have listened to what you say .
then I think there are lots of mistaken ideas going round .
i have clearly said it has to be on the basis of production .
i would like to say that producer organisations are an excellent option . it is actually necessary .
written statements rule 149 
unfortunately , the commission has taken a long time to act .
i welcome the measures proposed by the european commission to help europe's dairy producers .
agenda of the next sitting see minutes
opening of the sitting
the next item is the statements by the council and the commission on preparation of the european council .
mr president , next week , we have a meeting of the european council .
we must , of course , respect the democratic process in the czech republic .
as I said , we will discuss this in more detail this afternoon .
the swedish presidency was also asked by the finance ministers to continue the dialogue with the european parliament .
we have had very good experience of this dialogue and we think that it works well .
a high level of employment is required for sustainable public finances .
in this connection I would also like to remind you of what we said regarding exit strategies .
i would also like to say something about energy security .
we have prepared a report on the progress made since january .
the european council will take note of the report .
we had a very rewarding debate on this during parliament's plenary sitting in september .
it will also be noted that the eu and turkey have resumed talks on migration .
the council will be urged to strengthen frontex and to introduce common rules for frontex operations at sea .
finally , there will also be a debate on external relations .
the decisions it prepares will be taken by the commission or by the council in cfsp matters .
the most important issue in policy terms in the council will be copenhagen .
we need to help developing countries with concrete ideas on finance , as the european commission proposed last month .
the copenhagen agenda is not just about climate change .
institutions alone , however , are not enough .
